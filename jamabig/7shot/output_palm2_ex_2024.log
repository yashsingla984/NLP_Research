  0%|          | 0/1525 [00:00<?, ?it/s]The correct answer is D. Provide supportive care.

The patient has coin-shaped opacities in the stomach, which are likely foreign bodies. He has also developed intermittent apneic episodes, which are concerning for respiratory compromise. The first step is to provide supportive care, such as oxygen and naloxone. If the patient's condition does not improve, then further intervention may be necessary, such as endoscopy or gastric lavage.

Activated charcoal is not indicated in this case because it is not effective at removing foreign bodies from the stomach. Endoscopy is indicated if the foreign body is causing obstruction or bleeding. Gastric lavage is indicated if the foreign body is a drug overdose.

In this case, the patient's condition improved after administration of oxygen and naloxone. Therefore, the best course of action is to continue to provide supportive care and monitor the patient closely. If the patient's condition worsens, then further intervention may be necessary.

Here are some additional details on each of the answer choices:

* Activated charcoal is a medication that is used to absorb toxins from the stomach. It is not effective at removing foreign bodies from the stomach.
* Endoscopy is a procedure that is used to view the inside of the stomach. It is indicated if the foreign body is causing obstruction or bleeding.
* Gastric lavage is a procedure that is used to flush the stomach with water. It is indicated if the foreign body is a drug overdose.

  0%|          | 1/1525 [00:11<4:54:58, 11.61s/it]The correct answer is C. Emphysematous thyroiditis.

Emphysematous thyroiditis is a rare, life-threatening infection of the thyroid gland caused by gas-forming bacteria. It is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes and other underlying medical conditions that weaken the immune system.

The patient in this case presented with fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. These symptoms are consistent with emphysematous thyroiditis. The lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. This suggests that the patient swallowed the chicken bone, which perforated the esophagus and led to infection of the thyroid gland. The CT scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland. This further supports the diagnosis of emphysematous thyroiditis.

Parapharyngeal abscess and retropharyngeal abscess are both infections of the neck that can present with fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat. However, these infections are not typically associated with gas in the thyroid gland, as seen in this case. Mediastinitis is an infection of the mediastinum, the area of the chest between the lungs. It is a serious infection that can be fatal if not treated promptly. However, mediastinitis is not typically associated with fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat, as seen in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is emphysematous thyroiditis.

  0%|          | 2/1525 [00:25<5:31:08, 13.05s/it]The correct answer is D. Mpox.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common viral infection that causes cold sores and genital herpes. It is not the correct answer in this case because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of HSV infection, such as fever, sore throat, or lymphadenopathy. Additionally, the Tzanck smear showed ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which are characteristic of Mpox infection but not HSV infection.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that is most commonly found in the central and eastern United States. It is not the correct answer in this case because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of histoplasmosis, such as fever, cough, and weight loss. Additionally, the Tzanck smear showed ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which are characteristic of Mpox infection but not histoplasmosis.

Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that causes small, raised bumps on the skin. It is not the correct answer in this case because the patient's lesions are not typical of molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum lesions are usually small, white, and dome-shaped. They are often found on the trunk, groin, and buttocks. In this case, the patient's lesions are larger and more irregular in shape. Additionally, they are located on the face, trunk, and extremities, which are not typical sites for molluscum contagiosum lesions.

Mpox is a viral infection that is most commonly found in people with HIV/AIDS. It is caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). The clinical presentation of Mpox can vary, but it typically presents with painful, ulcerated lesions on the skin. The Tzanck smear showed ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which are characteristic of Mpox infection. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Mpox.

  0%|          | 3/1525 [00:37<5:12:04, 12.30s/it]The correct answer is C. Repeat complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks.

The patient in this case has a history of bladder carcinoma and is currently receiving chemotherapy. He presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, and his white blood cell count is elevated with a small number of blasts. These findings are concerning for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but they are not definitive. A bone marrow biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing AML, but it is an invasive procedure with potential risks. In this case, the patient is already at risk for bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia, so a bone marrow biopsy would be an additional risk.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a drug that is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML. However, ATRA is not effective in treating other subtypes of AML. In addition, ATRA can cause serious side effects, including skin rash, diarrhea, and liver toxicity.

Hydroxyurea is a drug that is used to treat a variety of hematologic disorders, including AML. However, hydroxyurea is not as effective as ATRA in treating APL, and it is not as well tolerated. In addition, hydroxyurea can cause serious side effects, including myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting.

Repeating the complete blood count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks is the most prudent course of action in this case. This will allow the physician to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and blast count to see if they are increasing. If the patient's white blood cell count and blast count are increasing, then a bone marrow biopsy can be performed to confirm the diagnosis of AML. If the patient's white blood cell count and blast count are stable or decreasing, then the patient may be able to be managed with supportive care and close monitoring.

The other choices are incorrect because they are either too risky or not necessary in this case.

  0%|          | 4/1525 [00:53<5:54:56, 14.00s/it]The correct answer is C. Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

The patient's history of a left cheek melanoma that was completely excised years prior, as well as his numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck, are significant risk factors for perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy. The patient's progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches are all consistent with this diagnosis. The initial MRIs were unremarkable, but a biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%, and tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values. These findings are also consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma is a rare cancer that starts in the lymph cells in the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer. The patient's history does not suggest that he has a weakened immune system, and his symptoms are not typical of primary leptomeningeal lymphoma.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare inflammatory disorder that affects the cranial nerves, particularly cranial nerve III (the oculomotor nerve). It is characterized by sudden-onset headache, unilateral ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the eye muscles), and periorbital pain. The patient's symptoms are not typical of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.

Sphenoid wing meningioma is a type of brain tumor that arises from the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. It is the most common type of meningioma, and it is usually benign (noncancerous). The patient's symptoms are not typical of a sphenoid wing meningioma.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are most consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

  0%|          | 5/1525 [01:09<6:15:27, 14.82s/it]The correct answer is D. Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. The patient is a 31-year-old man with a history of intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL. Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L. Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively; and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL. Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7. Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia.

Kimura disease is a rare, benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms. It is most common in people of Asian descent. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and the results of biopsy. Treatment is typically with corticosteroids and/or radiation therapy.

Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. It is most common in people in their 20s and 30s. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and the results of biopsy. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the white blood cells called T cells. It is most common in children and young adults. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and the results of blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and imaging tests. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions are a group of rare disorders that are characterized by the presence of eosinophilia (a high number of eosinophils in the blood) and the fusion of specific tyrosine kinase genes. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and the results of blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic testing. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy.

In this case, the patient's presentation is most consistent with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. The patient has a history of intermittent itching and night sweats, which are common symptoms of these disorders. He also has marked leukocytosis with a high number of eosinophils, which is another characteristic finding. The bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia and increased eosinophils, which is consistent with a myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm. The positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7, which are findings that can be seen in myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms. The left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, which are findings that are suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. However, the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the bone marrow biopsy are more consistent with a myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions.

  0%|          | 6/1525 [01:26<6:29:35, 15.39s/it]The correct answer is B. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory disorder of lymph nodes that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of lymph node biopsy. There is no specific treatment, and the disease usually resolves within a few weeks or months.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal lymphocytes, which can spread to other parts of the body. Lymphoma can present with a variety of symptoms, including lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment for lymphoma depends on the type and stage of the disease, but may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplantation.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, and lungs. SLE is characterized by the production of autoantibodies, which attack healthy tissue. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment for SLE depends on the severity of the disease, but may include medications to suppress the immune system.
* Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, benign disorder of the lymph nodes. It is characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes, which are cells that play a role in the immune system. Rosai-Dorfman disease can present with a variety of symptoms, including lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment for Rosai-Dorfman disease is usually not necessary, as the disease usually resolves on its own. However, in some cases, treatment with corticosteroids or other medications may be necessary.

  0%|          | 7/1525 [01:42<6:37:22, 15.71s/it]The correct answer is A: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The patient in this case has a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. She also presents with fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. Her electrocardiogram shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin. In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, she had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is a genetic disorder that causes the right ventricle to become enlarged and weak. This can lead to ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.

The next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis of ARVC. This can be done with cardiac MRI, which is a highly sensitive and specific test for ARVC. Cardiac MRI can show the characteristic changes in the right ventricle that are seen in ARVC, such as fatty infiltration, fibrosis, and thinning of the myocardium.

If the diagnosis of ARVC is confirmed, the patient will need to be treated with medications to control her arrhythmias and prevent sudden cardiac death. She may also need to have a defibrillator implanted to provide her with life-saving therapy in the event of a ventricular arrhythmia.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate in this case. Electrophysiology study (EPS) is a test that can be used to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. However, it is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of ARVC is already established. Genetic testing can be used to screen for ARVC, but it is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis is already established. Implantation of a cardiac defibrillator is a treatment option for patients with ARVC who are at high risk for sudden cardiac death. However, it is not necessary in this case because the patient is already being treated with medications to control her arrhythmias.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiac MRI is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of ARVC in this patient.

  1%|          | 8/1525 [01:59<6:43:23, 15.96s/it]The correct answer is C. Diffuse-type neurofibroma.

A. Arteriovenous malformation of the scalp is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins that can cause blood to flow too quickly through the blood vessels. This can lead to problems such as headaches, seizures, and stroke. However, arteriovenous malformations of the scalp are usually not painful and do not cause hair loss. In addition, they do not typically enhance on MRI scans, as the patient in this case did.

B. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare type of tumor that can occur in the skin, soft tissues, or lungs. It is usually non-cancerous and does not cause symptoms. However, solitary fibrous tumors can sometimes grow large enough to cause pain or pressure. In addition, they can occasionally bleed or rupture. In the case of the patient in this question, the lesion was described as "spongy and pulsatile," which is more consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse-type neurofibroma than solitary fibrous tumor.

C. Diffuse-type neurofibroma is a type of nerve sheath tumor that is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene. It is a non-cancerous tumor that can grow anywhere in the body, but it is most commonly found in the skin and soft tissues. Diffuse-type neurofibromas can be painful and can cause hair loss. They can also grow large enough to cause pressure on surrounding structures. In the case of the patient in this question, the lesion was described as "ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening." This is all consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse-type neurofibroma.

D. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the trunk and extremities. It is usually a painless lump that slowly grows over time. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can sometimes bleed or ulcerate. In the case of the patient in this question, the lesion was described as "7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass with an overlying gray patch of hair." This is not consistent with a diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Diffuse-type neurofibroma.

  1%|          | 9/1525 [02:14<6:37:12, 15.72s/it]The correct answer is D. Phaeohyphomycosis.

Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by a variety of fungi, including dematiaceous fungi (fungi that have dark-colored hyphae). The infection can occur in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, lungs, central nervous system, and other organs.

The most common symptoms of phaeohyphomycosis are skin lesions, which can be papules, nodules, or ulcers. The lesions may be single or multiple, and they may be black, brown, or red. The lesions may also be painful and itchy.

Phaeohyphomycosis can also cause respiratory symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The infection can also spread to the central nervous system, causing meningitis, encephalitis, and brain abscesses.

Phaeohyphomycosis is diagnosed by a skin biopsy, which shows the presence of fungal hyphae. The fungus can also be cultured from the biopsy or from blood cultures.

The treatment of phaeohyphomycosis depends on the site of the infection and the severity of the infection. Topical antifungals may be used to treat skin lesions. Oral or intravenous antifungals may be used to treat more serious infections.

The prognosis for phaeohyphomycosis varies depending on the site of the infection and the severity of the infection. Skin lesions are usually curable with antifungal treatment. However, infections that spread to other organs, such as the lungs or the central nervous system, can be life-threatening.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's presentation.

A. Chromoblastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi. The infection typically occurs in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and it can cause skin lesions, such as papules, nodules, or ulcers. However, the patient's presentation does not include any skin lesions.

B. Hyalohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by hyaline fungi (fungi that have clear or colorless hyphae). The infection can occur in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, lungs, central nervous system, and other organs. However, the patient's presentation does not include any symptoms of a systemic infection.

C. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The infection typically occurs in the lungs, but it can also spread to other organs, such as the skin, bones, and central nervous system. The patient's presentation does not include any symptoms of blastomycosis.

  1%|          | 10/1525 [02:31<6:44:17, 16.01s/it]The correct answer is B. Meningioma.

A meningioma is a type of tumor that grows from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor, accounting for about 30% of all brain tumors. They are usually benign (noncancerous), but can sometimes be malignant (cancerous).

The most common symptom of a meningioma is headache. Other symptoms may include seizures, vision problems, hearing loss, and numbness or weakness in the face or limbs.

Meningiomas are diagnosed with a variety of tests, including a CT scan, MRI scan, and spinal tap. Treatment for meningioma depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Surgery is the most common treatment, but radiation therapy or chemotherapy may also be used.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. Langerhans cell histiocytosis can affect the bones, skin, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. It is not a type of brain tumor.
* Acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis is a serious infection of the mastoid bone and sigmoid sinus. It is most common in children, but can also occur in adults. Symptoms include headache, fever, ear pain, and swelling and redness behind the ear. Treatment includes antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery.
* Cholesteatoma is a benign tumor that grows in the middle ear. It is caused by the build-up of skin cells and debris in the middle ear. Cholesteatomas can cause hearing loss, ear pain, and facial paralysis. Treatment includes surgery to remove the tumor.

  1%|          | 11/1525 [02:46<6:38:32, 15.79s/it]The correct diagnosis is leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies. The disease can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly seen in the skin, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract.

The patient in this case has a number of features that are consistent with leishmaniasis. First, he has a history of travel to an area where the disease is endemic, namely Guyana in South America. Second, he has a chronic ulcerative lesion on the uvula, which is a common presentation of leishmaniasis. Third, the lesion is unresponsive to treatment with antibiotics, which is also characteristic of leishmaniasis. Fourth, the histopathology of the lesion shows granulomatous inflammation, which is a hallmark of leishmaniasis.

The other possible diagnoses are all incorrect. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly seen in the lungs. Leprosy is a bacterial infection that affects the skin and nerves. Lethal midline granuloma is a rare disorder of unknown cause that affects the nasal cavity and surrounding structures.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis in this case is leishmaniasis. The patient's history, presentation, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. The other possible diagnoses are all incorrect.

  1%|          | 12/1525 [03:03<6:45:11, 16.07s/it]The correct answer is C. Medication adverse effect.

A. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the development of brown or black macules on the lips, buccal mucosa, and tongue. It is not associated with mycosis fungoides.

B. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can also occur in the oral mucosa. However, it is not typically associated with the other findings in this case, such as the patient's history of mycosis fungoides and the presence of lymphadenopathy.

C. Medication adverse effects are a common cause of oral mucosal pigmentation. In this case, the patient's history of treatment with romidepsin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride makes it likely that the oral pigmentation is a medication adverse effect.

D. Oral involvement of mycosis fungoides is a rare but well-described complication of the disease. However, it is not typically associated with the other findings in this case, such as the patient's history of treatment with romidepsin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Medication adverse effect. The other choices are incorrect because they are not supported by the patient's history and physical examination findings.

  1%|          | 13/1525 [03:14<6:11:46, 14.75s/it]The correct answer is B. Peripheral blood smear.

The patient has a history of a similar sensation in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

The most likely diagnosis is Loa loa filariasis, also known as loiasis. Loa loa is a nematode parasite that is transmitted to humans by the bite of the deerfly Chrysops. The parasite can cause a variety of symptoms, including a "fugitive swelling" of the eyelids, conjunctivitis, and periorbital edema. Peripheral blood smear is the most sensitive and specific test for Loa loa infection. The characteristic finding is the presence of microfilariae in the blood.

Treatment for Loa loa infection is with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). DEC is a medication that kills the microfilariae and adult worms. It is typically given for 12 days. Side effects of DEC can include fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches.

A is incorrect because diethylcarbamazine is not indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye. It is caused by an allergic reaction to something in the environment, such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. Treatment for allergic conjunctivitis typically includes over-the-counter or prescription eye drops that contain antihistamines or steroids.

C is incorrect because serological testing for onchocerciasis is not indicated for the patient in this case. Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of the blackfly Simulium. Onchocerciasis can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, eye problems, and lymphadenopathy. Serological testing is used to diagnose onchocerciasis. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of onchocerciasis.

D is incorrect because exploration of conjunctiva and removal of foreign body is not indicated for the patient in this case. The patient does not have any evidence of a foreign body in his eye. The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. This is consistent with the diagnosis of Loa loa filariasis.

  1%|          | 14/1525 [03:31<6:24:14, 15.26s/it]The correct answer is C. Observe with no additional testing or intervention.

The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye. He is asymptomatic and has normal best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure in both eyes. On examination, there is a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt. There is no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented iris lesion includes a number of benign and malignant conditions, including melanocytic nevi, iris melanoma, and metastatic tumors. However, the clinical features of this patient's lesion are most consistent with a benign melanocytic nevus. Melanocytic nevi are common, with a prevalence of up to 80% in adults. They are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, if a melanocytic nevus is suspicious for malignancy, it may be biopsied.

In this case, the patient's lesion is small, asymptomatic, and has a benign appearance on imaging studies. There is no evidence of tumor growth or metastasis. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention. The patient should be followed up with regular examinations to monitor for any changes in the lesion.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics is not necessary in this case because the lesion is benign and does not require treatment.
* Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy is a treatment for malignant melanoma. This treatment is not indicated for benign melanocytic nevi.
* Cyst paracentesis with complete drainage is a treatment for a cyst that is causing symptoms, such as pain or visual impairment. This treatment is not indicated for a small, asymptomatic cyst.

  1%|          | 15/1525 [03:48<6:35:02, 15.70s/it]The correct answer is D. Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis.

Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis is a rare, non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by mucin deposition in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of the lower extremities. It is most commonly seen in women, and is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The clinical presentation of euthyroid pretibial mucinosis is variable, but typically consists of one or more firm, skin-colored papules or nodules on the anterior aspect of the lower legs. The lesions may coalesce to form a large plaque, and may be associated with hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, and lymphedema.

The diagnosis of euthyroid pretibial mucinosis is made clinically, and is supported by biopsy findings of mucin deposition in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. There is no specific treatment for euthyroid pretibial mucinosis, but management may include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents.

Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is a chronic, progressive, sclerosing lymphedema of the lower extremities that is caused by infection with the bacterium Phialophora verrucosa. It is most commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions, and is often associated with poor hygiene and malnutrition.

The clinical presentation of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is characterized by a slowly progressive thickening and induration of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower extremities. The lesions may be associated with hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis, and verrucous hyperplasia.

The diagnosis of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is made clinically, and is supported by biopsy findings of lymphedema and granulomatous inflammation. There is no specific treatment for elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, but management may include surgical debridement, skin grafting, and antibiotic therapy.

Lobomycosis is a chronic, granulomatous fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that is caused by the fungus Lobomycosis loboi. It is most commonly seen in Central and South America, and is often associated with contact with soil or water contaminated with the fungus.

The clinical presentation of lobomycosis is characterized by one or more slowly progressive, nodular or plaque-like lesions on the skin. The lesions may be associated with ulceration, verrucous hyperplasia, and lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of lobomycosis is made clinically, and is supported by biopsy findings of granulomatous inflammation and the presence of the fungus in the tissue. There is no specific treatment for lobomycosis, but management may include surgical excision, antifungal therapy, and immunotherapy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis. The other choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, or treatment of the patient in the case.

  1%|          | 16/1525 [04:04<6:41:33, 15.97s/it]The correct answer is B. Familial cerebral cavernous malformations.

The patient presented with multiple bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs. These lesions are consistent with cutaneous vascular malformations. The patient also had a history of recurrent seizures and a right-sided hemiparesis and hemianopsia, which are consistent with cerebral venous malformations. The patient's father and aunt also had cerebral venous malformations, which is suggestive of a familial genetic disorder.

Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple blue-colored papules and nodules on the skin. These lesions are caused by abnormal blood vessels in the skin. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is not associated with cerebral venous malformations.

Glomuvenous malformations are rare vascular malformations that occur in the skin and mucous membranes. They are characterized by the presence of small, red or purple papules or nodules. Glomuvenous malformations are not associated with cerebral venous malformations.

Verrucous venous malformations are rare vascular malformations that occur in the skin and mucous membranes. They are characterized by the presence of large, wart-like papules or nodules. Verrucous venous malformations are not associated with cerebral venous malformations.

The patient's clinical presentation, family history, and laboratory findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformations.

  1%|          | 17/1525 [04:20<6:38:44, 15.87s/it]The correct answer is D. Observation.

A whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of metastatic disease. The patient has a small, amelanotic choroidal melanoma in her left eye. This type of tumor is typically slow-growing and rarely metastasizes. A PET scan would not provide any additional information that would change the management of this patient.

A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not indicated in this case because the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma is usually made on clinical grounds. The patient has a typical history and examination for choroidal melanoma, and the MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. An FNAB would not provide any additional information that would change the management of this patient.

Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment option for choroidal melanoma, but it is not indicated in this case because the tumor is small and has not grown significantly over the past 6 months. The patient is also at high risk for complications from plaque radiotherapy, such as radiation retinopathy.

Observation is the best management option for this patient. The patient should be monitored regularly with clinical examination and imaging studies to assess for tumor growth. If the tumor grows significantly, then plaque radiotherapy or other treatment options may be considered.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not indicated in this case.
It is reasoning
  1%|          | 18/1525 [04:36<6:42:50, 16.04s/it]The correct answer is C. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP). EBP is a rare, chronic, pruritic skin disorder characterized by the development of blisters and erosions on the skin, particularly the lower extremities. The blisters are caused by a defect in the anchoring fibrils that attach the epidermis to the dermis, the layer of skin below the epidermis. This defect makes the skin fragile and prone to blistering, particularly with minor trauma.

The patient in the case presented with progressive, multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin for more than 10 years. On close inspection, milia and a few erosions with partially detached epidermis were identified. There were no abnormalities of the mucous membranes, nails, hair, or teeth. No extracutaneous involvement was observed.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with EBP. The characteristic lesions of EBP are blisters and erosions on the skin, particularly the lower extremities. The blisters are often itchy and may be painful. The erosions may become infected. The skin around the lesions may be red and thickened.

The diagnosis of EBP is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy will show a separation of the epidermis from the dermis. There may also be inflammation in the dermis.

There is no cure for EBP, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. Treatment may include topical steroids, oral antihistamines, and phototherapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the blisters and erosions.

The prognosis for patients with EBP is variable. Some patients have mild disease that is easily controlled with treatment. Others have more severe disease that is difficult to control. The disease can be disfiguring and can lead to social isolation.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient. Pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD) is a common skin disorder characterized by the development of pruritic papules on the shins. Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) is a chronic skin disorder characterized by the development of thickened, red, scaly patches on the skin. Lichen amyloidosis (LA) is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by the development of pruritic, papular, or nodular lesions on the skin.

  1%|          | 19/1525 [04:52<6:44:34, 16.12s/it]The correct answer is D: Check blood pressure.

The patient's history of relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy suggests that she may have chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease can lead to high blood pressure, which can in turn damage the blood vessels in the eyes. The patient's symptoms of painless vision loss and central scotoma in her left eye are consistent with hypertensive retinopathy, a condition that is caused by high blood pressure in the retinal blood vessels.

Prescribing systemic corticosteroids is not the correct answer because there is no evidence that the patient has an inflammatory condition. Serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infectious disease. Ruling out a brain tumor is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor.

Therefore, the correct answer is to check the patient's blood pressure. If the patient's blood pressure is high, it should be treated to prevent further damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.

Here are additional details about each of the incorrect answer choices:

* Prescribing systemic corticosteroids is not the correct answer because there is no evidence that the patient has an inflammatory condition. Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat inflammatory conditions, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an inflammatory condition. Therefore, there is no reason to prescribe systemic corticosteroids.
* Ordering serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infectious disease. Infectious neuroretinitis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that is caused by an infection. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infectious disease. Therefore, there is no reason to order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis.
* Ruling out a brain tumor is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor. Brain tumors can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, headaches, and seizures. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor. Therefore, there is no reason to rule out a brain tumor.

  1%|▏         | 20/1525 [05:09<6:45:16, 16.16s/it]The correct answer is B. Rhabdomyoma.

Rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor of skeletal muscle. It is the most common soft tissue tumor in infants and children, and it is usually diagnosed in the first year of life. Rhabdomyomas are typically located in the head and neck, but they can also occur in other parts of the body.

The most common symptom of rhabdomyoma is a mass that is visible or palpable. Rhabdomyomas may also cause pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing. In some cases, rhabdomyomas may spread to other parts of the body.

The diagnosis of rhabdomyoma is made based on a physical examination, imaging studies, and a biopsy. Imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan, can help to determine the size and location of the tumor. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the type of rhabdomyoma.

The treatment of rhabdomyoma depends on the size and location of the tumor, the patient's age, and the patient's overall health. In most cases, rhabdomyomas can be treated with surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used in some cases.

The prognosis for rhabdomyoma is generally good. Most patients with rhabdomyoma have no long-term problems. However, in some cases, rhabdomyomas may recur or spread to other parts of the body.

The other answer choices are incorrect because:

* Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common soft tissue tumor in infants and children, but it is not typically located in the tongue.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. It is much less common than rhabdomyoma, and it typically occurs in older children and adults.
* Teratoma is a rare tumor that can contain tissue from any of the three germ layers. It is not typically located in the tongue.

  1%|▏         | 21/1525 [05:25<6:46:53, 16.23s/it]The correct answer is C. Start topical steroids and perform a skin patch test.

A skin biopsy is not necessary in this case because the patient has a history of a similar rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy. This suggests that the rash is likely due to an allergic reaction, and a skin biopsy would not provide any additional information.

Prescribing acyclovir is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection, such as fever, chills, or lymphadenopathy. In addition, the skin swab bacterial culture was negative, which further suggests that the rash is not due to a viral infection.

Treating with doxycycline is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of bacterial infection, such as fever, chills, or lymphadenopathy. In addition, the skin swab bacterial culture was negative, which further suggests that the rash is not due to a bacterial infection.

Starting topical steroids and performing a skin patch test is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Topical steroids will help to reduce the inflammation and itching associated with the rash, and the skin patch test will help to identify the specific allergen that is causing the reaction.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* A skin biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. Skin biopsies are typically used to diagnose skin cancer or other serious skin conditions. However, in this case, the patient has a history of a similar rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy. This suggests that the rash is likely due to an allergic reaction, and a skin biopsy would not provide any additional information.
* Prescribing acyclovir is a medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. Herpes simplex virus infections can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, chills, lymphadenopathy, and a rash. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. In addition, the skin swab bacterial culture was negative, which further suggests that the rash is not due to a viral infection.
* Treating with doxycycline is a medication that is used to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial infections can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, chills, lymphadenopathy, and a rash.

  1%|▏         | 22/1525 [05:37<6:11:17, 14.82s/it]The correct answer is A. Disseminated fusariosis.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. She was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status.

The physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities. Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed.

The histopathologic examination of the skin biopsy specimen showed septate hyphae and oval microconidia, consistent with Fusarium spp. The wet mount preparation of the tissue culture colony also showed septate hyphae and oval microconidia.

Disseminated fusariosis is a fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer or who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation. The infection can spread to the skin, lungs, central nervous system, and other organs. The most common symptoms of disseminated fusariosis are fever, chills, and respiratory symptoms. The skin lesions can be papular, nodular, or ulcerative. The diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis is made by biopsy of a skin lesion or other affected organ. Treatment is with antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B or voriconazole.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Invasive aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer or who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation. The infection can spread to the lungs, sinuses, brain, and other organs. The most common symptoms of invasive aspergillosis are fever, chills, and respiratory symptoms. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is made by biopsy of a lung lesion or other affected organ. Treatment is with antifungal medications, such as voriconazole or posaconazole. However, the patient's skin lesions are not typical of invasive aspergillosis.
* Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a bacterial infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer or who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation. The infection typically begins as a small, red papule that rapidly enlarges and becomes necrotic. The lesions are often painful and tender. The diagnosis of pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is made by biopsy of a skin lesion. Treatment is with antibiotics, such as ceftazidime or meropenem. However, the patient's skin lesions are not typical of pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum.
* Sweet syndrome is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory disorder that can occur in both children and adults. The disorder is characterized by fever, skin lesions, and leukocytosis. The skin lesions are typically painful, tender, and erythematous papules or plaques. The diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is made based on clinical findings. Treatment is with corticosteroids, such as prednisone. However, the patient's skin lesions are not typical of Sweet syndrome.

A. Matrical carcinoma is a rare, aggressive form of skin cancer that originates in the hair follicle matrix. It is characterized by a rapidly growing, ulcerated tumor that often metastasizes to the lymph nodes and other organs. The patient in this case does not have any of the clinical features of matrical carcinoma, such as a rapidly growing, ulcerated tumor or lymphadenopathy.

B. Panfolliculoma is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It is characterized by a small, raised nodule that is usually located on the face or scalp. The patient in this case does not have any of the clinical features of panfolliculoma, such as a small, raised nodule on the face or scalp.

C. Bullous pilomatricoma is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle matrix. It is characterized by a cystic tumor with a central keratin plug and a surrounding rim of basophilic cells. The patient in this case has a cystic tumor with a central keratin plug and a surrounding rim of basophilic cells, which are characteristic of bullous pilomatricoma.

D. Trichodiscoma is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle isthmus. It is characterized by a small, raised nodule that is usually located on the face or scalp. The patient in this case does not have any of the clinical features of trichodiscoma, such as a small, raised nodule on the face or scalp.

The patient has a history of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is a genetic disorder that can cause tumors to form in the brain, eyes, skin, heart, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. The most common type of tumor in TSC is the subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), which is a slow-growing tumor that usually occurs in the ventricles of the brain. SEGAs can cause seizures, headaches, and hydrocephalus (a buildup of fluid in the brain).

The patient in the case report has several features that are consistent with TSC, including a history of seizures, a facial angiofibroma (a small, red growth on the face), and subungual fibromas (small, skin-colored growths under the nails). The patient also has a retinal lesion that is consistent with a type 1 astrocytic hamartoma of the retina, which is a benign tumor that can occur in patients with TSC.

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is important to order a brain MRI to look for any associated central nervous system tumors. A brain MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting SEGAs. If a SEGA is found, it can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Initiate anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment is not the best option in this case because the patient does not have a known retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated disorder.
* Option C: Perform hypercoagulable workup is not the best option in this case because the patient does not have any clinical features of a hypercoagulable disorder.
* Option D: Order echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography is not the best option in this case because the patient does not have any clinical features of a cardiovascular disorder.

The patient in the case presents with a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome. These include dysphagia, a malar rash, Raynaud phenomenon, and pulmonary fibrosis. Antisynthetase syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These autoantibodies can damage tissues throughout the body, including the lungs, heart, and muscles.

A percutaneous lung biopsy is not necessary in this case, as the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are highly suggestive of antisynthetase syndrome. A quadriceps muscle biopsy may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, but it is not necessary in all cases. Treatment for antisynthetase syndrome typically involves the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Arrange a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy: This is not necessary in this case, as the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are highly suggestive of antisynthetase syndrome.
* C. Perform a quadriceps muscle biopsy: This may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, but it is not necessary in all cases.
* D. Prescribe 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily): This is a reasonable treatment option for antisynthetase syndrome, but it is not the only option. Other immunosuppressive medications may also be used.

  2%|▏         | 27/1525 [06:53<6:21:41, 15.29s/it]The correct answer is C. Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor.

Perineurioma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the perineurium, the connective tissue sheath that surrounds peripheral nerves. It most commonly occurs in adults, and is typically found in the extremities. The most common symptom is pain, which may be accompanied by numbness, tingling, or weakness. On imaging, perineuriomas are typically well-circumscribed, hypodense masses that do not enhance with contrast. The treatment of choice is surgical excision.

Fibroblastic lipoblastoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the lipoblasts, which are cells that produce fat. It most commonly occurs in children, and is typically found in the extremities. The most common symptom is a painless mass. On imaging, fibroblastic lipoblastomas are typically well-circumscribed, heterogeneous masses that may contain fat. The treatment of choice is surgical excision.

Schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate the peripheral nerves. It is the most common type of nerve sheath tumor. Schwannomas can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head and neck, followed by the extremities. The most common symptom is a painless mass. On imaging, schwannomas are typically well-circumscribed, round or oval masses that enhance with contrast. The treatment of choice is surgical excision.

Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the mesenchymal cells. It most commonly occurs in children, and is typically found in the extremities. The most common symptom is a painless mass. On imaging, pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumors are typically well-circumscribed, heterogeneous masses that do not enhance with contrast. The treatment of choice is surgical excision.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor. This is because the patient is a child, the mass is located in the oropharynx, and the imaging findings are consistent with a pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor. The other choices are less likely because they are more common in adults, or because they do not typically occur in the oropharynx.

The patient is a 3-year-old girl with no medical history who presented to the emergency department with 1 day of abnormal gait and bilateral mydriasis. Two weeks prior, she had upper respiratory symptoms and bacterial conjunctivitis treated with topical ofloxacin. On examination, pupils were fixed and dilated to 8 mm, extraocular movements were intact, and fundus examination was normal. She had brisk reflexes, poor coordination, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Bloodwork revealed leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; cultures remained without growth. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits were normal. The patient was discharged 3 days later following improvement in lethargy and gait with a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia.

When she presented to ophthalmology for 1-week follow-up, her visual acuity was central, steady, and maintained in both eyes. She demonstrated sluggish but reactive pupils and new-onset ophthalmoplegia. She was unable to move either eye in any direction, including with doll’s head maneuver. She was readmitted to the hospital and demonstrated diminished reflexes bilaterally and unsteady gait. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse enhancement of the lower thoracic and cauda equina nerve roots and enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve (Figure).

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Miller Fisher syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that typically presents with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and confirmed with anti-GQ1b antibody testing. The mainstay of treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with Miller Fisher syndrome.

A. Repeat blood cultures and start antibiotics is incorrect because the patient has no evidence of infection. The blood cultures were negative and there is no clinical evidence of meningitis or sepsis.

B. Repeat lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies is incorrect because the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were normal on the initial lumbar puncture. There is no need to repeat the lumbar puncture unless there is clinical evidence of meningitis or sepsis.

C. Order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin is correct because the patient has Miller Fisher syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that responds well to IVIg therapy.

D. Start intravenous corticosteroids is incorrect because corticosteroids are not effective in the treatment of Miller Fisher syndrome.

  2%|▏         | 29/1525 [07:20<5:59:01, 14.40s/it]The correct diagnosis is melanoma. This is based on the following findings:

* The patient is a 46-year-old man, which is the peak age for melanoma.
* The lesion began as a maculopapular lesion and progressed over time, which is typical of melanoma.
* The lesion is located on the shoulder, which is a common site for melanoma.
* The lesion is large and fungating, which is a characteristic of melanoma.
* The lesion is necrotic and ulcerated, which is a sign of advanced melanoma.
* The biopsy shows sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. This is a classic histologic finding of melanoma.
* Immunohistochemistry demonstrates SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. SOX10 is a protein that is often expressed in melanoma cells, while pankeratin is a protein that is typically expressed in epithelial cells. This finding supports the diagnosis of melanoma.
* A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases. This finding is consistent with metastatic melanoma.
* Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis. This finding suggests that the melanoma is localized to the shoulder and axillary lymph nodes.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is most common in older adults. It is typically located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands. The lesion is typically a raised, red, or scaly patch that may bleed or ulcerate. Squamous cell carcinoma is not typically fungating or necrotic.
* Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is the most common type of skin cancer. It is typically located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands. The lesion is typically a small, raised, smooth bump that may be pearly or translucent. Basal cell carcinoma is not typically fungating or necrotic.
* Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that is typically located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands. The lesion is typically a small, raised, red, or purple bump that may ulcerate. Merkel cell carcinoma is not typically fungating or necrotic.

The patient has bilateral retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments. The retinal vasculitis is likely secondary to the cabozantinib therapy, as it began around the time of treatment initiation. The retinal detachments are likely due to the vasculitis, as well as the vitreous inflammation and traction.

The first step in management is to stop the cabozantinib therapy. This will help to reduce the inflammation and vasculitis. The patient is already taking prednisone, which is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation. However, the prednisone is not likely to be effective in treating the retinal vasculitis and detachments.

The next step is to perform a diagnostic vitrectomy. This is a procedure in which the vitreous humor (the gel-like substance that fills the eye) is removed. This will allow the doctor to visualize the retina and assess the extent of the vasculitis and detachments. The vitrectomy may also help to relieve the vitreous traction and improve the vision.

If the retinal detachments are extensive, they may need to be repaired surgically. This is a procedure in which the retina is reattached to the back of the eye.

The patient should also be monitored for signs of infection. The retinal vasculitis and detachments can increase the risk of infection. The patient should be instructed to report any fever, chills, or other signs of infection to his doctor.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. This is not the appropriate treatment for retinal vasculitis and detachments. Foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime are antibiotics that are used to treat infections. There is no evidence that these antibiotics are effective in treating retinal vasculitis and detachments.
* C. Stop cabozantinib and admit for intravenous solumedrol. This is not the appropriate treatment for retinal vasculitis and detachments. Intravenous solumedrol is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammation. However, it is not likely to be effective in treating retinal vasculitis and detachments. The patient is already taking prednisone, which is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation.
* D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits followed by lumbar puncture. This is not the appropriate treatment for retinal vasculitis and detachments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture are tests that are used to diagnose infections and other medical conditions. However, they are not necessary to diagnose or treat retinal vasculitis and detachments.

  2%|▏         | 31/1525 [07:54<6:28:13, 15.59s/it]The correct answer is A. Obtain MRI of the left shoulder.

The patient has a history of syringomyelia, a condition in which a fluid-filled cavity develops in the spinal cord. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and weakness. In some cases, syringomyelia can also lead to the destruction of bone, including the humeral head.

The patient's symptoms, including left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in his left upper extremity, are consistent with syringomyelia. The radiographic findings of complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification are also consistent with syringomyelia.

An MRI of the left shoulder would provide more information about the extent of the bone destruction and the cause of the patient's symptoms. This information would be helpful in planning the patient's treatment.

B. Order serum tumor marker testing is incorrect because there is no evidence of cancer in this patient. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with cancer, and the radiographic findings are not consistent with cancer.

C. Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery is incorrect because the patient's symptoms may be due to syringomyelia, not to arthritis or other conditions that would require shoulder replacement surgery. The radiographic findings are also consistent with syringomyelia, not with arthritis or other conditions that would require shoulder replacement surgery.

D. Perform an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with infection. The radiographic findings are also not consistent with infection.

  2%|▏         | 32/1525 [08:09<6:28:29, 15.61s/it]The correct answer is C. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient has a left main coronary artery dissection, which is a life-threatening condition. PCI is the most effective treatment for SCAD, as it can restore blood flow to the heart muscle and prevent further damage. Medical management, such as medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, may be used in addition to PCI, but it is not a substitute for PCI. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgical procedure that is sometimes used to treat SCAD, but it is not as effective as PCI and is associated with a higher risk of complications.

Here are the details of each treatment option:

* **Observation:** Observation is not an appropriate treatment for SCAD, as it does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Left main coronary artery dissection is a life-threatening condition, and observation would allow the condition to progress and cause further damage to the heart muscle.
* **Medical management:** Medical management may be used in addition to PCI to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but it is not a substitute for PCI. Medical management alone is not effective in treating SCAD and will not prevent further damage to the heart muscle.
* **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI):** PCI is the most effective treatment for SCAD. PCI involves inserting a balloon catheter into the affected coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. This restores blood flow to the heart muscle and prevents further damage. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that is associated with a low risk of complications.
* **Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG):** CABG is a surgical procedure that is sometimes used to treat SCAD. CABG involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. CABG is a more invasive procedure than PCI and is associated with a higher risk of complications.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Percutaneous coronary intervention. PCI is the most effective treatment for SCAD, as it can restore blood flow to the heart muscle and prevent further damage.

  2%|▏         | 33/1525 [08:26<6:33:33, 15.83s/it]The correct answer is B. VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic) syndrome.

VEXAS syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, including skin rashes, fever, joint pain, and inflammation of the eyes and other organs. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the E1 enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down proteins. This mutation leads to the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the body, which triggers an inflammatory response.

The patient in the case meets several criteria for a diagnosis of VEXAS syndrome. He has a history of diffuse erythematous, edematous annular plaques, which are a characteristic skin rash associated with the syndrome. He also has low-grade fevers, mild leukopenia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These findings are all consistent with an inflammatory process.

The patient's medical history is also consistent with VEXAS syndrome. He has a history of hypertension, which is a common comorbidity in patients with the syndrome. He also has seasonal allergies, which can be a trigger for flares of the disease.

The patient's laboratory evaluation is also consistent with VEXAS syndrome. He has mild neutropenia and lymphopenia, which are common findings in patients with the syndrome. His antinuclear antibody screening results were negative, which rules out other autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus.

The patient's treatment history is also consistent with VEXAS syndrome. He has been treated with hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, and oral prednisone, all of which are medications that are used to treat VEXAS syndrome. However, he has not responded well to these treatments.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and treatment history, the most likely diagnosis is VEXAS syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Drug-induced SCLE is a type of lupus erythematosus that is caused by certain medications. However, the patient in the case has a history of treatment with hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, and oral prednisone, all of which are medications that are used to treat lupus erythematosus. This suggests that the patient's skin rash is not due to a drug reaction.
* Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, inflammatory disorder that causes fever, skin lesions, and inflammation of the lymph nodes. However, the patient in the case does not have any lymphadenopathy.
* Halogenoderma is a skin condition that is caused by exposure to certain halogens, such as iodine and bromine. However, the patient in the case has not been exposed to any halogens.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is VEXAS syndrome.

  2%|▏         | 34/1525 [08:43<6:42:58, 16.22s/it]The correct answer is C. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and blood vessels. It is characterized by the development of yellowish papules on the skin, particularly in the flexural areas (e.g., the neck, armpits, and groin). The skin may also become loose and wrinkled, and there may be problems with vision and bleeding.

Inherited cutis laxa (ICL) is another rare, inherited disorder that affects the elastic fibers in the skin. It is characterized by the development of loose, wrinkled skin that is often accompanied by joint laxity and other connective tissue problems.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency is a rare, inherited disorder that shares some features with both PXE and ICL. It is characterized by the development of yellowish papules on the skin, loose, wrinkled skin, and problems with vision and bleeding. However, unlike PXE and ICL, people with pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency also have a deficiency in one or more of the clotting factors. This can lead to problems with blood clotting and an increased risk of bleeding.

The patient in the case presented with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. She also had a history of yellowish papules on the skin, particularly in the flexural areas. In addition, she had a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is characterized by the development of yellowish papules on the skin, particularly in the flexural areas. However, the patient in the case did not have any history of these papules.
* B. Inherited cutis laxa is characterized by the development of loose, wrinkled skin that is often accompanied by joint laxity and other connective tissue problems. However, the patient in the case did not have any history of joint laxity or other connective tissue problems.
* D. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum/pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like overlap syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that shares some features with both PXE and ICL. However, the patient in the case did not have any history of vision or bleeding problems.

  2%|▏         | 35/1525 [09:00<6:47:06, 16.39s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies.

The patient has a history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, which are known to carry the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. The patient also has a pulmonary cyst that is compressing the right main bronchus, which is a common presentation of hydatid disease. Serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies is the most sensitive and specific way to diagnose hydatid disease.

Stool testing for E granulosus eggs is not as sensitive or specific as serologic testing. In addition, stool testing can only be positive if the patient has an active infection with E granulosus. The patient in this case may have had a previous infection with E granulosus that has resolved, in which case stool testing would be negative.

Lung biopsy and liver biopsy are invasive procedures that should only be performed if there is a high clinical suspicion of hydatid disease. In this case, the patient's history and imaging findings are highly suggestive of hydatid disease, so there is no need to perform a lung biopsy or liver biopsy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies. This is the most sensitive and specific way to diagnose hydatid disease.

  2%|▏         | 36/1525 [09:11<6:08:50, 14.86s/it]The correct answer is C. Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing.

The patient has multiple skin lesions, foot drop, and hand contractures. He also has a history of recent immigration from Samoa. These findings are suggestive of Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy. Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness.

The initial diagnostic workup for leprosy includes a skin biopsy, which can be used to identify M. leprae. The biopsy should be sent to a laboratory that specializes in leprosy diagnosis, such as the US National Hansen’s Disease Program. PCR testing is the most sensitive method for detecting M. leprae.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not be the best next steps in the management of this patient.

* Option A, incubate skin biopsy specimen on chocolate agar, is incorrect because this is not a sensitive or specific test for leprosy.
* Option B, obtain serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1, is incorrect because this test is not as sensitive or specific as PCR testing.
* Option D, treat with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine, is incorrect because this is a treatment regimen for leprosy, but the diagnosis of leprosy has not yet been confirmed.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing.

  2%|▏         | 37/1525 [09:27<6:19:12, 15.29s/it]The correct answer is B: Order genetic testing.

The patient has a history of heart failure, neuropathy, and spinal stenosis. These conditions are all associated with hereditary diseases, such as amyloidosis, Fabry disease, and Pompe disease. Genetic testing can help to identify the underlying cause of these conditions and guide treatment.

A bone marrow biopsy is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a bone marrow disorder. Random skin biopsies are also not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a skin disorder. 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a monoclonal gammopathy.

Genetic testing is the most appropriate next step in this case. Genetic testing can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's conditions and guide treatment.

  2%|▏         | 38/1525 [09:43<6:19:42, 15.32s/it]The correct answer is D. Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography.

The patient has a history of diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and 20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable.

A serous choroidal detachment is a separation of the choroid from the sclera. It is most commonly caused by a decrease in the production of aqueous humor, which is the fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye. A decrease in aqueous humor production can be caused by a number of factors, including trauma, inflammation, and tumors.

The most common symptoms of a serous choroidal detachment are blurred vision, pain, and redness in the eye. The diagnosis is made with a slit lamp examination, which allows the doctor to see the inside of the eye. Treatment for a serous choroidal detachment depends on the underlying cause. If the cause is trauma, the treatment may involve bed rest and the use of steroids. If the cause is inflammation, the treatment may involve the use of steroids and cycloplegics. If the cause is a tumor, the treatment may involve surgery.

In this case, the patient has a history of diminished vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and 20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of serous choroidal detachment. The most likely cause of the choroidal detachment is a decrease in the production of aqueous humor. The decrease in aqueous humor production could be caused by a number of factors, including trauma, inflammation, or a tumor.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The MRI with MRA or DSA will help to determine the cause of the choroidal detachment. If the cause of the choroidal detachment is a tumor, the treatment may involve surgery.

The other answer choices are not correct because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a technique that is used to visualize the anterior segment of the eye. It is not helpful in the diagnosis or management of serous choroidal detachment. Uveitis workup and steroids are used to treat uveitis, which is an inflammation of the uveal tract. Uveitis is not the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Thyroid profile is used to assess the function of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is not involved in the pathogenesis of serous choroidal detachment.

  3%|▎         | 39/1525 [09:59<6:27:12, 15.63s/it]The correct answer is D. Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery.

A peripheral iridotomy is a procedure to create a small opening in the iris, the colored part of the eye, to allow the flow of aqueous humor out of the anterior chamber. This is usually done to treat acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a type of glaucoma that occurs when the iris blocks the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber. In this case, the patient does not have glaucoma, so a peripheral iridotomy would not be helpful.

A full-thickness sclerectomy is a surgical procedure to create a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor in the eye. This is usually done to treat chronic angle-closure glaucoma. In this case, the patient does not have glaucoma, so a full-thickness sclerectomy would not be helpful.

Administering intravenous corticosteroids is a treatment for anterior uveitis, which is an inflammation of the iris and ciliary body. In this case, the patient does have anterior uveitis, but it is secondary to the retinal detachment. Corticosteroids would help to reduce the inflammation, but they would not address the underlying cause of the problem, which is the retinal detachment.

Combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery is a procedure to remove a cataract and repair a retinal detachment. This is the most appropriate treatment for this patient because it addresses both of the problems that she is having. The phacoemulsification will remove the cataract, and the vitrectomy will remove the vitreous gel from the eye and repair the retinal detachment.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery.

  3%|▎         | 40/1525 [10:16<6:35:07, 15.96s/it]The correct answer is C. Intravitreal steroid injection.

The patient in this case has a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete. His visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. He received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved. However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration.

The patient's presentation is consistent with posterior uveitis secondary to his prior treatment with nivolumab and obinutuzumab. Posterior uveitis is a common side effect of these drugs, and it can cause a variety of visual symptoms, including floaters, blurred vision, and decreased visual acuity. In some cases, posterior uveitis can also lead to retinal damage and vision loss.

The treatment for posterior uveitis secondary to nivolumab and obinutuzumab is usually intravitreal steroid injection. Intravitreal steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can be injected directly into the eye. They are very effective in treating posterior uveitis, and they can help to prevent retinal damage and vision loss.

In this case, the patient's visual acuity has already decreased significantly, and he is at risk for further vision loss. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to start him on a course of intravitreal steroid injections. This will help to reduce the inflammation in his eye and protect his retina from further damage.

The other choices are not appropriate in this case. Immunomodulatory therapy is not effective for posterior uveitis secondary to nivolumab and obinutuzumab. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous debris from the eye. It is not necessary in this case, as the patient's vitreous is clear. Observation is not an appropriate treatment for posterior uveitis, as it can lead to further vision loss.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Intravitreal steroid injection.

  3%|▎         | 41/1525 [10:30<6:23:36, 15.51s/it]The correct answer is B: Venous malformation.

A schwannoma is a benign tumor of the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, and are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. On MRI, schwannomas are typically isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. They may enhance after gadolinium administration, but the enhancement is typically homogeneous.

A pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor of salivary gland tissue. They are the most common type of salivary gland tumor, and are typically found in the parotid gland. On MRI, pleomorphic adenomas are typically isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. They may enhance after gadolinium administration, but the enhancement is typically heterogeneous.

A paraganglioma is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from paraganglia, which are small clusters of neuroendocrine cells that are found throughout the body. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, and are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. On MRI, paragangliomas are typically hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging. They may enhance after gadolinium administration, but the enhancement is typically heterogeneous.

The patient in the case presented with a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted imaging, was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of venous malformation. Venous malformations are benign vascular tumors that are composed of dilated veins. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, and are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. On MRI, venous malformations are typically hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging. They may enhance after gadolinium administration, but the enhancement is typically heterogeneous.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not typically present with the imaging findings that were described in the case. Schwannomas are typically isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. They may enhance after gadolinium administration, but the enhancement is typically heterogeneous. Pleomorphic adenomas are typically isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. They may enhance after gadolinium administration, but the enhancement is typically heterogeneous. Paragangliomas are typically hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging.

Maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient has no history of malignancy and the imaging findings do not show any evidence of a mass lesion. Schwannoma is also an unlikely diagnosis because the imaging findings do not show any evidence of a tumor arising from the nerve sheath. Metastases from ovarian primary is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient has no history of ovarian cancer and the imaging findings do not show any evidence of metastatic disease in the brain.

Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) with perineural spread is a more likely diagnosis because the patient has a history of diabetes, which is a risk factor for mucormycosis, and the imaging findings show evidence of fungal infection in the sinuses with perineural spread to the facial nerve.

Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection that can affect the sinuses, lungs, skin, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with diabetes, cancer, or organ transplants. Mucormycosis can be fatal if not treated promptly.

The treatment for mucormycosis is antifungal medications and surgery to remove infected tissue. The prognosis for people with mucormycosis depends on the extent of the infection and the patient's overall health.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. The proteins form amyloid deposits, which can damage the organs and tissues they affect.

There are several types of amyloidosis, but the one that is most likely to cause a lesion on the tongue is localized amyloidosis. Localized amyloidosis is a rare condition that affects the skin, tongue, and other mucous membranes. It is caused by the buildup of a type of protein called amyloid A (AA).

The symptoms of localized amyloidosis vary depending on the organ or tissue that is affected. In the case of a tongue lesion, the patient may experience a painless nodule on the tongue. The nodule may be red or purple, and it may be firm to the touch.

The diagnosis of localized amyloidosis is made based on a biopsy of the lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of amyloid deposits in the tissue.

There is no cure for localized amyloidosis, but the condition can be managed with treatment. Treatment options include surgery to remove the lesion, medications to suppress the immune system, and medications to reduce the production of amyloid A protein.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the case.

A fibroma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that can grow anywhere in the body, including the tongue. Fibromas are typically small, painless, and slow-growing. They are usually made of fibrous connective tissue.

A granular cell tumor is a rare, benign tumor that can grow anywhere in the body, including the tongue. Granular cell tumors are typically small, painless, and slow-growing. They are usually made of granular cells, which are a type of cell that is found in the skin and other tissues.

Median rhomboid glossitis is a condition that causes a red, smooth, depigmented area on the midline of the tongue. It is usually asymptomatic, but it can sometimes cause pain, burning, or sensitivity to hot and cold foods. The cause of median rhomboid glossitis is unknown, but it is thought to be a developmental anomaly.

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure. He presents with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on his head. He denies any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use.

On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques are seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient. On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques are noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque is noted on the left lower back. There is no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Peripheral blood test results reveal a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 202 U/L.

A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the erythematous plaque on the left lower back. The histopathologic findings show a cellular infiltrate of basophilic blastoid cells with prominent nucleoli and mitotic figures. The cells are positive for CD123 and negative for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD30, and CD56.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a rare, aggressive hematologic malignancy of dendritic cells. It typically presents in adults with skin lesions, fever, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made by skin biopsy and immunophenotyping. There is no standard treatment for BPDCN, but chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation may be used. The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of only 12 months.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a malignancy of the kidney. It would not be expected to present with skin lesions in the absence of metastasis to the skin.
* Epithelioid angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant vascular tumor. It typically presents as a rapidly growing mass on the skin or subcutaneous tissue.
* Myeloid leukemia cutis is a rare, aggressive form of leukemia that involves the skin. It typically presents as a rash of red, scaly patches on the skin.

A. Cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions were not consistent with multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. Cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma can manifest as a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and tumors. However, the skin lesions in this patient were annular erythematous plaques, which are not typical of multiple myeloma.

B. Erythema multiforme is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions were not consistent with erythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme is a skin condition that is characterized by the sudden appearance of round, red lesions on the skin. The lesions often have a central blister or bulla, and they may be surrounded by a pale halo. Erythema multiforme is often associated with a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus or Epstein-Barr virus.

C. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is the correct diagnosis because the patient's skin lesions were consistent with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, inflammatory disorder that is characterized by fever, skin lesions, and leukocytosis. The skin lesions in histiocytoid Sweet syndrome are typically annular erythematous plaques, as they were in this patient. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is often associated with underlying hematologic disorders, such as multiple myeloma or leukemia.

D. Cutaneous cryptococcosis is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions were not consistent with cutaneous cryptococcosis. Cutaneous cryptococcosis is a fungal infection of the skin that is caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Cutaneous cryptococcosis can manifest as a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and ulcers. However, the skin lesions in this patient were annular erythematous plaques, which are not typical of cutaneous cryptococcosis.

  3%|▎         | 46/1525 [11:45<6:05:32, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is D. Takayasu arteritis.

Takayasu arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis that affects the aorta and its major branches, including the renal arteries. It is a chronic, progressive disease that can lead to narrowing or occlusion of the arteries, resulting in hypertension, stroke, and other complications.

The patient in the case presentation has several features that are consistent with Takayasu arteritis, including:

* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a common finding in Takayasu arteritis.
* Abdominal bruit: A bruit is a whooshing sound that can be heard over an artery when it is narrowed or blocked. The patient has an abdominal bruit, which is suggestive of renal artery stenosis.
* Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings: The patient's cranial MRI showed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. This finding is consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a neurological complication of hypertension that can occur in Takayasu arteritis.
* Computed tomography angiography (CTA) findings: The patient's CTA revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing. These findings are consistent with Takayasu arteritis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disorder that is characterized by narrowing of the small arteries that supply blood to the brain. It is not associated with hypertension or renal artery stenosis.
* Atherosclerotic disease is a chronic, progressive disease that affects the arteries throughout the body. It is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack. However, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.
* Fibromuscular dysplasia is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disease that affects the arteries throughout the body. It is characterized by the presence of fibrous and muscular dysplasia of the arterial wall. It is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.

  3%|▎         | 47/1525 [12:02<6:17:05, 15.31s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies.

The patient has a diffuse cutaneous eruption with several features that are suggestive of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These features include the confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules, waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet, thickened, onycholytic nails, and severe ectropion.

A skin biopsy is the most important diagnostic test for mycosis fungoides. It can be used to confirm the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides and to determine the stage of the disease. T-cell clonality studies are a specialized test that can be performed on skin biopsy specimens to look for evidence of clonal expansion of T cells. This is a characteristic finding in mycosis fungoides.

The other answer choices are not as likely to be helpful in diagnosing mycosis fungoides. A myositis-specific autoantibody panel is a group of tests that can be used to look for antibodies that are associated with inflammatory myopathies. These are not typically associated with mycosis fungoides. Testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody is a test that can be used to look for antibodies that are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. This is not typically associated with mycosis fungoides. Testing for HLA-B27 is a test that can be used to look for a gene that is associated with ankylosing spondylitis. This is not typically associated with mycosis fungoides.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies. This is the most important diagnostic test for mycosis fungoides and can be used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the stage of the disease.

  3%|▎         | 48/1525 [12:18<6:24:25, 15.62s/it]The correct answer is C. Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

The patient has black tongue discoloration, which is a common and benign condition that is usually caused by elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue. It is often seen in patients who are dehydrated, have poor oral hygiene, or are taking certain medications. In the absence of other symptoms, black tongue discoloration does not require treatment.

The patient in this case has a history of subscapularis pyomyositis, which is an infection of the muscle. He is currently being treated with intravenous cefazolin, an antibiotic. Black tongue discoloration is a possible side effect of cefazolin. However, it is important to note that black tongue discoloration is not a sign of infection or a serious medical problem.

In this case, the best course of action is to provide reassurance to the patient and prescribe oral care. The patient should be instructed to brush his teeth twice a day and to use a tongue scraper to remove any debris from the tongue. He should also be advised to drink plenty of fluids and to avoid smoking and alcohol.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, measuring serum cortisol level, is not necessary in this case. Black tongue discoloration is not caused by a hormonal imbalance.
* Option B, performing a tongue biopsy, is not necessary in this case. Black tongue discoloration is a benign condition and does not require a biopsy.
* Option D, stopping cefazolin, is not necessary in this case. Black tongue discoloration is a possible side effect of cefazolin, but it is not a serious side effect. The patient should continue taking cefazolin as prescribed by his doctor.

  3%|▎         | 49/1525 [12:27<5:35:21, 13.63s/it]The correct answer is C. Hairy pharyngeal polyp.

A teratoma is a rare type of tumor that can occur in any part of the body. It is made up of different types of tissue, including skin, hair, teeth, and bones. Teratomas are usually benign (not cancerous), but they can sometimes be cancerous.

A dermoid cyst is a type of cyst that is made up of skin cells. It is usually found in the head and neck area, but it can also occur in other parts of the body. Dermoid cysts are usually benign, but they can sometimes be cancerous.

A squamous papilloma is a type of wart that is caused by a virus. It is usually found on the skin, but it can also occur in the mouth and throat. Squamous papillomas are usually benign, but they can sometimes be cancerous.

Hairy pharyngeal polyps are rare benign tumors that arise from the mucosa of the pharynx. They are usually pedunculated and have a characteristic white, papillary appearance. Histologically, they are composed of a mixture of stratified squamous epithelium, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and smooth muscle. The exact cause of hairy pharyngeal polyps is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by chronic irritation of the mucosa. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

In the case of the 7-year-old girl, the lesion was a pedunculated, white rubbery mass arising from the left posterior tonsillar pillar with a narrow mucosal stalk. This is characteristic of a hairy pharyngeal polyp. The histologic examination showed both ectodermal and mesodermal components, including keratinizing squamous epithelium with Actinomyces colonization overlying pilosebaceous units including hair follicles, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous glands. This is also consistent with a diagnosis of hairy pharyngeal polyp. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not account for the clinical and histologic features of the lesion.

  3%|▎         | 50/1525 [12:41<5:37:28, 13.73s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics.

The patient has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has recently undergone chemotherapy. She presents with bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain. She also reports rhinorrhea and lethargy. Her ophthalmic examination shows visual acuity of 20/800 OD and 20/400 OS, decreased from her baseline of 20/200 OU. Intraocular pressures are 37 mm Hg OD and 31 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination reveals chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and microcystic corneal edema bilaterally. There were more than 20 cells per high-power field of 1 mm × 1 mm beam, with fibrin bilaterally and 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye. Posterior segment examination was limited because of corneal edema and anterior inflammation, but there were no vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography.

The most likely diagnosis is endophthalmitis, a serious infection of the eye. Endophthalmitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is most commonly seen in patients who have had recent eye surgery, but it can also occur in patients with other eye conditions, such as uveitis or glaucoma.

The treatment for endophthalmitis is antibiotics. The antibiotics are injected into the vitreous cavity of the eye. This is called intravitreal injection. Intravitreal antibiotics are very effective in treating endophthalmitis. However, they can also cause serious side effects, such as retinal detachment and cataracts.

The patient in this case has a history of AML and has recently undergone chemotherapy. She is at increased risk for developing endophthalmitis because of her weakened immune system. She also has bilateral hypopyon, which is a sign of severe inflammation.

The correct treatment for this patient is to obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics. The anterior chamber paracentesis will allow the doctor to obtain a sample of the fluid from the front of the eye. This fluid can then be sent to the lab to be tested for bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The intravitreal antibiotics will help to treat the infection and prevent further damage to the eye.

The other options are incorrect. Option A, observe, as this is expected inflammation after voretigene neparvovec gene therapy, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with expected inflammation after voretigene neparvovec gene therapy. Option B, perform pars plana vitrectomy, is incorrect because pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is not necessary in this case. Option D, await results from systemic laboratory tests and blood culture, is incorrect because the patient needs to be treated immediately with antibiotics.

  3%|▎         | 51/1525 [12:57<5:56:40, 14.52s/it]The correct answer is A. Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of congenital nystagmus. Congenital nystagmus is a type of nystagmus that is present at birth. It is caused by a defect in the development of the visual system, and it is often associated with other eye problems, such as strabismus (crossed eyes) and amblyopia (lazy eye).

The patient's brain MRI scan was reported as normal, but this does not rule out the possibility of a brain abnormality. In some cases, congenital nystagmus is caused by a brain tumor or other structural abnormality. Therefore, it is important to review the brain MRI scan carefully to look for any abnormalities.

An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The ERG can be used to diagnose a variety of eye problems, including congenital nystagmus.

In the patient's case, the ERG is likely to be normal. However, it is important to order the test to rule out other possible causes of the nystagmus.

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this case.

B. Refer for strabismus surgery: Strabismus surgery is not indicated in the patient's case. The patient's nystagmus is not caused by strabismus, and strabismus surgery would not improve the nystagmus.

C. Order genetic workup: A genetic workup may be indicated in some cases of congenital nystagmus. However, in the patient's case, the history and examination findings are not suggestive of a genetic cause. Therefore, a genetic workup is not necessary at this time.

D. Treat with clonazepam: Clonazepam is a medication that can be used to treat nystagmus. However, clonazepam is not a first-line treatment for congenital nystagmus. In the patient's case, the nystagmus is not severe enough to warrant treatment with clonazepam.

  3%|▎         | 52/1525 [13:14<6:10:40, 15.10s/it]The correct answer is B. Pyoderma gangrenosum.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, and potentially life-threatening skin disorder characterized by painful, non-healing ulcers that often develop at sites of trauma or infection. The ulcers are typically deep and have undermined borders. They may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and anemia.

The underlying cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. It is often associated with underlying medical conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

There is no cure for pyoderma gangrenosum, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent the ulcers from spreading. Treatment options include topical and systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and other immunosuppressive medications.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Leukemia cutis is a type of skin cancer that occurs in people with leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of leukemia cells in the skin. The patient in this case does not have leukemia, so leukemia cutis is not a likely diagnosis.

C. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that affects small blood vessels in the skin. It is characterized by the presence of small, red, raised spots on the skin. The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic skin lesions of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, so this is not a likely diagnosis.

D. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of small, red, raised spots on the skin. The spots typically resolve on their own within a few weeks or months. The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic skin lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis, so this is not a likely diagnosis.

  3%|▎         | 53/1525 [13:30<6:19:21, 15.46s/it]The correct answer is B. Genetic testing.

The patient has a history of kidney disease, which is a risk factor for hereditary optic neuropathy (HON). HON is a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive vision loss. The most common type of HON is Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), which is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. LHON typically affects young men and causes rapid, painless vision loss in both eyes.

The patient's presentation is consistent with HON. She has a history of kidney disease, which is a risk factor for HON. She also has a relative afferent pupillary defect, which is a sign of optic nerve damage. The patient's optic discs are anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye. This is also consistent with HON.

Genetic testing is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Genetic testing can identify the specific mutation that is causing the patient's vision loss. This information can be used to provide the patient with accurate information about her prognosis and to develop a plan for managing her condition.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. MRI can be used to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as a brain tumor or stroke. However, MRI is not necessary in this patient because her presentation is consistent with HON.

Vasculitis serological evaluation is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It can cause vision loss, but it is not a common cause of vision loss in patients with kidney disease. In this patient, the history, physical examination, and imaging studies are not consistent with vasculitis.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. PET is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that can be used to detect cancer and other diseases. However, PET is not necessary in this patient because her presentation is consistent with HON.

Symplastic glomus tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm of the glomus body, a small, specialized sensory organ found in the dermis. It is typically found in the hands and feet, but can occur anywhere on the body. The tumor is usually small, less than 1 cm in diameter, and is often asymptomatic. When symptomatic, it may present as a painful nodule. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is surgical excision.

Angioleiomyoma is a rare, benign neoplasm of the blood vessels. It is typically found in the skin, but can occur anywhere in the body. The tumor is usually small, less than 1 cm in diameter, and is often asymptomatic. When symptomatic, it may present as a painful nodule. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is surgical excision.

Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm of the soft tissue. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the abdomen. The tumor is usually large, greater than 5 cm in diameter, and is often asymptomatic. When symptomatic, it may present as a painful mass. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is surgical excision.

Malignant myopericytoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm of the pericytes, cells that surround blood vessels. It is typically found in the soft tissue of the extremities, but can occur anywhere in the body. The tumor is usually large, greater than 5 cm in diameter, and is often symptomatic. When symptomatic, it may present as a painful mass with overlying skin changes. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is surgical excision with or without radiation therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas that were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. He presents with a tender, enlarging scalp lesion of 6 months’ duration. Skin examination reveals a 5-mm bright pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels located at the crown of the scalp. There is no purulent discharge or overlying skin changes. A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis. The histopathologic findings show a proliferation of tumor cells around small vessels with scattered mitoses and necrosis. The tumor cells stain positive for smooth muscle actin. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of malignant myopericytoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not account for the clinical and histopathologic findings in this case. Symplastic glomus tumor is a benign neoplasm that typically presents as a small, painful nodule. Angioleiomyoma is also a benign neoplasm that typically presents as a small, asymptomatic nodule. Solitary fibrous tumor is a benign neoplasm that typically presents as a large, asymptomatic mass. Malignant myopericytoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that typically presents as a large, symptomatic mass.

Patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma is a rare, non-aggressive form of Kaposi sarcoma that typically presents as a single, violaceous patch on the lower extremities of elderly men. It is not associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that typically presents as erythematous, papular, or nodular lesions on the face, hands, and feet. It is not associated with microvenular hemangiomas.

Acquired progressive lymphangioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a single, soft, fluctuant mass on the extremities. It is not associated with microvenular hemangiomas.

Microvenular hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that typically presents as multiple, small, red or purple papules on the face, neck, and upper extremities. It is more common in women than men. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they may cause itching or bleeding. Microvenular hemangiomas are thought to be caused by a mutation in the RAS gene. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is usually not necessary, but the lesions may be removed for cosmetic reasons.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma is a rare, non-aggressive form of Kaposi sarcoma that typically presents as a single, violaceous patch on the lower extremities of elderly men. It is not associated with microvenular hemangiomas.
* Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that typically presents as erythematous, papular, or nodular lesions on the face, hands, and feet. It is not associated with microvenular hemangiomas.

  4%|▎         | 56/1525 [14:14<6:11:19, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is B. Discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid.

The patient in this case has developed acute respiratory distress following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of osteal occlusion of left main coronary artery. He was initially treated with amiodarone for supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. However, he developed persistent pulmonary edema despite adequate diuresis. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields. In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is used to treat a variety of arrhythmias. It is a lipophilic drug that is highly protein-bound and has a long half-life. Amiodarone can accumulate in the lungs and cause a variety of pulmonary adverse effects, including pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis, and pleural effusion.

The treatment of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is to discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The dose of corticosteroid and the duration of treatment should be individualized based on the severity of the pulmonary toxicity.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Perform a lung biopsy is incorrect because a lung biopsy is not necessary to diagnose amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.
* Answer C: Perform bronchoalveolar lavage is incorrect because bronchoalveolar lavage is not necessary to diagnose amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.
* Answer D: Check amiodarone plasma level is incorrect because checking amiodarone plasma level is not necessary to diagnose amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

  4%|▎         | 57/1525 [14:30<6:19:06, 15.49s/it]The correct answer is A. Implant a defibrillator.

The patient has a history of syncope and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). She has also had two episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), which is a life-threatening arrhythmia. The presence of PVCs and PVT, as well as the patient's history of syncope, puts her at high risk for sudden cardiac death. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is implanted in the chest and can deliver an electric shock to the heart if it detects a life-threatening arrhythmia. ICDs have been shown to be very effective in preventing sudden cardiac death in patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias.

B. Perform provocative drug testing with procainamide is incorrect. Procainamide is a drug that can be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias. However, it can also increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in some patients. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use procainamide in this patient who has a history of syncope and ventricular arrhythmias.

C. Start nadolol is incorrect. Nadolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including high blood pressure and angina. However, it is not effective in treating ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, it is not appropriate to start nadolol in this patient who has a history of syncope and ventricular arrhythmias.

D. Ablate PVCs is incorrect. Ablation is a procedure that can be used to destroy areas of the heart that are causing arrhythmias. However, it is not effective in treating all arrhythmias. In addition, ablation can be a risky procedure. Therefore, it is not appropriate to ablate PVCs in this patient who has a history of syncope and ventricular arrhythmias.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Implant a defibrillator. The other choices are incorrect because they are not effective in treating the patient's condition or they are too risky.

A barium enema is not indicated in this case because the patient has a gallstone ileus, which is a mechanical obstruction of the small intestine by a gallstone. Barium would not help to diagnose or treat this condition.

A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to diagnose gallstones and other conditions of the bile ducts. However, MRCP is not necessary in this case because the patient has already had a non-contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed a thickened gallbladder with air and gallstones adherent to the duodenum, with a suspected fistula tract. This finding is diagnostic of gallstone ileus.

An emergency explorative laparotomy is a surgical procedure that is used to diagnose and treat conditions of the abdomen. However, this procedure is not necessary in this case because the patient has already had a CT scan that has provided a definitive diagnosis.

The patient should be treated with intravenous fluid resuscitation to correct her hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. She should also be started on antibiotics to prevent infection. After she has been stabilized, she can be taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the surgical removal of the gallbladder.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide the best treatment for the patient's condition.

  4%|▍         | 59/1525 [14:57<5:56:59, 14.61s/it]The correct answer is A. Check stool for ova and parasites. The patient has abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a petechial rash. These symptoms are consistent with a parasitic infection. A stool test for ova and parasites is the most appropriate way to diagnose a parasitic infection. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens would not be helpful in this case, as it would not detect parasites. An antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level would not be helpful in this case, as it is not a marker of parasitic infection. Sending blood for fungal culture would not be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of a fungal infection.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each choice:

A. Check stool for ova and parasites

A stool test for ova and parasites is the most appropriate way to diagnose a parasitic infection. The most common parasites that cause diarrhea in humans are protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica, and helminths, such as roundworms, tapeworms, and pinworms. A stool test can detect the presence of eggs, larvae, or adult parasites in the stool.

B. Obtain a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens is a test that can detect the presence of a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites in the stool. However, it is not specific for parasites. A PCR panel would be helpful in this case if the patient had symptoms suggestive of a bacterial or viral infection, such as fever, chills, or vomiting.

C. Order measurement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level

An antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level is a test that can detect the presence of antibodies that attack neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. ANCA levels are elevated in some autoimmune diseases, such as vasculitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, ANCA levels are not elevated in parasitic infections.

D. Send blood for fungal culture

Sending blood for fungal culture is a test that can detect the presence of fungi in the blood. Fungal infections are rare in healthy individuals, but they can occur in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with cancer or HIV/AIDS. Sending blood for fungal culture would not be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of a fungal infection.

The patient has CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations). Intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were ineffective, and the patient refused additional treatment due to pain and transient decreased vision. Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin is unlikely to be effective, as the patient has already developed resistance to these agents. Leflunomide is an immunosuppressive agent that is not indicated for the treatment of CMV retinitis.

Multivirus-specific CTLs are a type of white blood cell that can kill cells infected with a variety of viruses. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of CMV retinitis in animal models. A phase 2 clinical trial is currently underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multivirus-specific CTLs in the treatment of CMV retinitis in humans.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin is unlikely to be effective, as the patient has already developed resistance to these agents.
* Continued foscarnet and ganciclovir intravitreal injections were ineffective, and the patient refused additional treatment due to pain and transient decreased vision.

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of hysterectomy who presented with a palpable left axillary mass. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions. The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 10 weeks. She then transferred her care to our center for surgical management. We requested the pathology slides for review at our laboratory and additional immunostaining was performed, which revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for PAX8 (Figure 1B), p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3.

The differential diagnosis for a high-grade adenocarcinoma of unknown primary includes a variety of tumors, including those of the breast, lung, colon, and stomach. However, the presence of PAX8 expression in the tumor cells is highly suggestive of a gynecological origin. PAX8 is a transcription factor that is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the endometrium, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Expression of PAX8 in a tumor of unknown primary is a well-established marker of gynecological origin.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are all consistent with a gynecological malignancy. The presence of high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features, estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positivity, and a high Ki67 index is also consistent with a gynecological malignancy. The additional immunostaining for PAX8, p53, and WT1 further supports the diagnosis of a gynecological malignancy.

The patient was treated with surgery and chemotherapy. She is currently doing well and is disease-free at 2 years after diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is a rare tumor that typically presents as a thyroid nodule. It is not associated with a high-grade adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.
* High-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is made when a high-grade carcinoma is found in the absence of a primary tumor. In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are all consistent with a gynecological malignancy.
* High-grade papillary carcinoma of unknown primary is a rare tumor that typically presents as a metastasis in the lung, lymph nodes, or liver. It is not associated with a high-grade adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.

The patient is a 7-year-old boy with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on his left lower neck since birth. His parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI. The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis. Van Gieson stain highlighted elastic fibers surrounding individual chondrocytes.

A branchial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly that arises from incomplete closure of the branchial clefts. It is most commonly located in the anterior triangle of the neck, and is typically lined with squamous epithelium and contains mucus. Branchial cleft cysts are usually asymptomatic, but may become infected or cause cosmetic deformity. Treatment is surgical excision.

An epidermoid cyst is a benign skin lesion that arises from the invagination of the epidermis. It is typically located on the face, scalp, or trunk, and is filled with keratin. Epidermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic, but may become infected or inflamed. Treatment is surgical excision.

A hair follicle nevus is a congenital anomaly that involves the abnormal proliferation of hair follicles. It is typically located on the scalp, and may be associated with other skin abnormalities, such as nevus sebaceus. Hair follicle nevi are usually asymptomatic, but may become infected or inflamed. Treatment is surgical excision.

The patient in this case has a cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant, which is a rare congenital anomaly that arises from incomplete separation of the branchial arches. It is typically located in the anterior triangle of the neck, and is composed of cartilage, bone, and soft tissue. Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnants are usually asymptomatic, but may become infected or cause cosmetic deformity. Treatment is surgical excision.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Branchial cleft cysts are typically lined with squamous epithelium and contain mucus. The patient in this case has a mass that is composed of cartilage, bone, and soft tissue.
* Epidermoid cysts are typically filled with keratin. The patient in this case has a mass that is composed of cartilage, bone, and soft tissue.
* Hair follicle nevi are typically located on the scalp. The patient in this case has a mass that is located in the anterior triangle of the neck.

It most commonly affects the long bones, but can also occur in the soft tissues. The tumor is characterized by a large, fluid-filled cyst that is lined with a thin layer of cells. The cyst is often surrounded by a rim of bone. SABCs are usually asymptomatic, but can cause pain, swelling, and deformity. Diagnosis is usually made with imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment is usually surgical excision, which is curative in most cases.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Soft tissue giant cell tumor (SGCT) is a rare, malignant tumor that typically occurs in adults. It most commonly affects the hands and feet, but can also occur in other parts of the body. The tumor is characterized by a large, multinodular mass of cells that contain giant cells. SGCTs are often aggressive and can metastasize to other parts of the body.
* Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (OFMT) is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in adults. It most commonly affects the soft tissues of the extremities, but can also occur in other parts of the body. The tumor is characterized by a large, lobulated mass of cells that contain spindle-shaped cells, fibroblasts, and myxoid material. OFMTs are usually slow-growing and non-aggressive.
* Soft tissue osteosarcoma (SOTS) is a rare, malignant tumor that typically occurs in adults. It most commonly affects the extremities, but can also occur in other parts of the body.

Pilonidal sinus is a common, chronic, and recurrent infection of hair follicles in the natal cleft. It is most common in young men, and is often associated with obesity, diabetes, and poor hygiene. The diagnosis is made clinically, and is confirmed by imaging studies such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment typically involves surgical excision of the sinus tract and drainage of any abscesses.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Cutaneous larva migrans is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of certain nematodes. It is characterized by a linear, serpiginous rash that is often associated with pruritus and inflammation. The diagnosis is made clinically, and is confirmed by skin biopsy. Treatment typically involves oral administration of an antiparasitic medication such as ivermectin.
* C. Median raphe cyst is a congenital anomaly that results from the failure of the raphe to close during embryogenesis. It is a small, fluid-filled cyst that is located on the midline of the perineum. The diagnosis is made clinically, and is confirmed by imaging studies such as ultrasonography or MRI. Treatment typically involves surgical excision of the cyst.
* D. Vellus hair cyst is a common, benign skin lesion that is caused by the obstruction of a hair follicle. It is a small, round, raised lesion that is filled with keratinous material. The diagnosis is made clinically, and is confirmed by skin biopsy. Treatment typically involves incision and drainage of the cyst.

The patient has diabetic dermopathy, which is a common skin condition in people with diabetes. It is characterized by hyperpigmented macules and patches, as well as tense bullae. The bullae are usually asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously within a few weeks.

The first step in treating diabetic dermopathy is to control the patient's blood sugar levels. This can be done with diet, exercise, and oral or injected medications. In some cases, insulin may be necessary.

If the bullae are large or painful, they may need to be aspirated. This can be done with a sterile needle and syringe. The fluid from the bullae should be sent for culture to rule out infection.

The bullae should then be covered with a clean dressing. The dressing should be changed daily to prevent infection.

The patient should be instructed to keep the area clean and dry. They should also avoid scratching the area, as this can lead to infection.

In most cases, diabetic dermopathy is a self-limiting condition. However, if the bullae are large or painful, or if they do not resolve within a few weeks, the patient may need to be seen by a dermatologist.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the other choices are incorrect:

* B. Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence is not necessary in most cases of diabetic dermopathy. The diagnosis can usually be made based on the patient's history and physical examination.
* C. Start oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d) is not necessary in most cases of diabetic dermopathy. Corticosteroids can be used to treat inflammation, but they are not necessary in this condition.
* D. Treat with oral cephalexin for 7 days is not necessary in most cases of diabetic dermopathy. Oral antibiotics are not necessary to treat this condition.

  4%|▍         | 66/1525 [16:46<6:12:55, 15.34s/it]The correct answer is B. Commence high-dose corticosteroids.

The patient has a history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. Over the past 2 weeks, she has experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in her quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. She denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. She took no regular medication and did not smoke.

At presentation, her visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography. External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 000 /µL; to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 12 500 /µL), elevated C-reactive protein (19.4 mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), elevated plasma viscosity (2.06 mPas), and thrombocytosis (467 ×103/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1). Kidney function was within normal limits. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a systemic vasculitis that most commonly affects the medium-sized arteries, including the temporal arteries. The classic triad of GCA is headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. However, up to one-third of patients may not have all three features. Other common symptoms include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of GCA is made based on clinical findings and laboratory testing. Blood tests may show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not always necessary. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of the head, may be helpful in ruling out other causes of headache.

The treatment of GCA is with high-dose corticosteroids. Prednisone is typically started at 1 mg/kg/day and tapered over a period of 6-12 months. The goal of treatment is to prevent permanent visual loss, which can occur in up to 20% of patients with untreated GCA.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings are highly suggestive of GCA. The laboratory findings of an elevated ESR and CRP are also consistent with the diagnosis. The patient should be started on high-dose corticosteroids as soon as possible. Imaging studies are not necessary to make the diagnosis, but they may be helpful in ruling out other causes of headache. The patient should also be referred to a rheumatologist for further management.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A. Request a magnetic resonance image of orbits and sinuses is incorrect because MRI is not necessary to make the diagnosis of GCA. B. Commence broad-spectrum antibiotics is incorrect because GCA is not an infection. C. Request urgent stroke consult is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of stroke.

  4%|▍         | 67/1525 [17:03<6:22:45, 15.75s/it]The correct answer is C: Start corticosteroids.

The patient's presentation is consistent with orbital myositis, a rare inflammatory condition of the extraocular muscles. Orbital myositis is most commonly seen in patients with underlying autoimmune diseases, such as multiple myeloma. The most common presentation is acute onset of pain, redness, and swelling of the eyelids, with associated proptosis and limitation of extraocular movements.

The initial treatment for orbital myositis is corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation and swelling, and can improve symptoms within a few days. In some cases, additional treatment with immunosuppressants may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Start antifungal therapy: This is not the correct treatment for orbital myositis. Orbital myositis is not caused by an infection, and antifungal therapy would not be effective.
* Sinus biopsies: This is not the correct treatment for orbital myositis. Sinus biopsies are typically only performed if there is suspicion of an underlying sinus infection. In this case, the patient has already had a CT scan of the sinuses that showed no evidence of infection.
* Orbital biopsy: This is not the correct treatment for orbital myositis. Orbital biopsies are typically only performed if there is suspicion of an underlying malignancy. In this case, the patient has a history of multiple myeloma, which is a type of cancer. However, there is no evidence of malignancy in the patient's orbital tissues.

Therefore, the correct treatment for this patient is to start corticosteroids.

  4%|▍         | 68/1525 [17:20<6:29:43, 16.05s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform hemoglobin electrophoresis.

The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, as well as his recent presentation with acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency, are concerning for a sickle cell crisis. Sickle cell crisis is a medical emergency that can be life-threatening. It is caused by a genetic mutation that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which is called sickle hemoglobin. Sickle hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped, which can block blood flow and lead to organ damage.

The patient's low hemoglobin level and hematocrit level are consistent with a sickle cell crisis. Obtaining blood cultures, performing a vitreous tap, and injecting antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case. Blood cultures are used to detect infection, but the patient's presentation is not consistent with an infection. A vitreous tap is a procedure that is used to collect fluid from the vitreous humor, which is a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This procedure is not necessary in this case, as the patient's eye examination is stable. Injecting antibiotics into the vitreous humor would not be effective in treating a sickle cell crisis.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that is used to detect abnormal hemoglobin. This test is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. If the test results are positive for sickle hemoglobin, the patient will need to be treated with medications to prevent sickle cell crises and to manage the symptoms of the crisis.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

  5%|▍         | 69/1525 [17:32<6:02:08, 14.92s/it]The correct answer is B. Inflammation of actinic keratoses.

Actinic keratoses are precancerous lesions that develop on sun-exposed skin. They are caused by damage to the DNA of skin cells by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Actinic keratoses are common, especially in people who have fair skin and have spent a lot of time in the sun.

Most actinic keratoses do not develop into skin cancer. However, some can turn into squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. It is important to have actinic keratoses checked by a doctor so that they can be treated if necessary.

The most common symptom of actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch on the skin. The patch may be pink, red, or brown. It may also be itchy. Actinic keratoses are often found on the face, hands, arms, and legs.

There is no cure for actinic keratoses. However, there are treatments that can help to remove them. The most common treatment is to apply a topical cream or gel that contains a medication called 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Other treatments include cryotherapy (freezing), electrodesiccation (burning), and laser therapy.

The rash in the case is most likely due to inflammation of actinic keratoses. This is supported by the fact that the patient has a history of substantial sun exposure, which is a risk factor for actinic keratoses. The rash is also pruritic, erythematous, and scaly, which are all typical features of actinic keratoses. Additionally, the rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline, which suggests that it is not caused by a bacterial infection, an autoimmune disorder, or a medication reaction.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer is incorrect because the patient has no history of skin cancer.
* C. Medication hypersensitivity reaction is incorrect because the rash did not respond to treatment with three different medications.
* D. Discoid lupus erythematosus is incorrect because the rash is not associated with any other symptoms of lupus, such as joint pain or fatigue.

A schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and insulate nerve fibers. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing and can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. Symptoms of a schwannoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor, but they may include pain, numbness, weakness, and paralysis. Treatment for a schwannoma usually involves surgical removal of the tumor.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not typically found in the trachea. Chondromas are benign tumors that arise from cartilage. Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus body, which is a small, specialized structure that regulates blood flow. Granular cell tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells.

Here are some additional details about schwannomas:

* Schwannomas are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor.
* They are typically slow-growing and benign, but they can rarely be malignant.
* Schwannomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region, followed by the arms and legs.
* Symptoms of a schwannoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor, but they may include pain, numbness, weakness, and paralysis.
* Treatment for a schwannoma usually involves surgical removal of the tumor.
* Radiation therapy may be used to treat tumors that cannot be completely removed with surgery.
* Chemotherapy is not usually used to treat schwannomas.
* The prognosis for people with schwannomas is generally good. Most people with schwannomas have a normal life expectancy. However, some people with schwannomas may experience complications from the tumor, such as pain, numbness, weakness, or paralysis.

The patient in the case presented with unilateral hearing loss, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and imaging findings of a lytic lesion in the petrous apex of the temporal bone. These findings are consistent with Gorham-Stout disease, a rare disorder characterized by progressive osteolysis and soft tissue involvement.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a non-malignant disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. LCH can involve the bones, skin, and other organs. However, it is not typically associated with osteolysis of the temporal bone.

Cholesteatoma is a benign tumor that can arise in the middle ear. It is typically caused by chronic inflammation of the middle ear. Cholesteatomas can cause hearing loss, but they are not typically associated with osteolysis of the temporal bone.

Sarcoma is a group of malignant tumors that can arise from bone or soft tissue. Sarcomas are not typically associated with osteolysis of the temporal bone.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with findings that are consistent with Gorham-Stout disease. A is the correct answer.

Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used to treat a variety of diseases, including essential thrombocytosis. It works by inhibiting the production of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is necessary for cell growth and division. Hydroxyurea can cause a number of side effects, including skin problems.

Squamous dysplasia is a precancerous condition of the skin. It is characterized by the abnormal growth of squamous cells, which are the cells that make up the outer layer of the skin. Squamous dysplasia can develop in any area of the skin, but it is most commonly seen on the sun-exposed areas, such as the face, neck, and hands.

The patient in this case has a history of essential thrombocytosis and has been treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years. She has developed numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. These findings are consistent with hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations is incorrect because the patient's lesions are not simply ulcerations. They are also crusted and ulcerated, which suggests that they are more than just superficial wounds.

C. Hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption is incorrect because the patient's lesions are not photodistributed. They are found on both sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed areas of the skin.

D. Iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis is incorrect because the patient's lesions are not verrucous. They are crusted and ulcerated, which suggests that they are more than just benign warts.

The patient has a long history of multiple painless scalp nodules, which is characteristic of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The nodules are typically hard and smooth, and they can occur anywhere on the body. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. It is characterized by the development of multiple soft tissue tumors, which can be located in the skin, muscles, bones, and other organs. The tumors are typically benign, but they can cause significant disfigurement and disability. There is no cure for juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscle tissue. It is characterized by the development of multiple soft tissue tumors, which can be located in the skin, muscles, bones, and other organs. The tumors are typically benign, but they can cause significant disfigurement and disability. There is no cure for infantile myofibromatosis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. However, the patient in the case does not have any muscle tumors, so infantile myofibromatosis is not the correct diagnosis.
* Mafucci syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone and connective tissue. It is characterized by the development of multiple bone tumors, as well as soft tissue tumors, hemangiomas, and pigmented skin lesions. The tumors are typically benign, but they can cause significant disfigurement and disability. There is no cure for Mafucci syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. However, the patient in the case does not have any bone tumors, so Mafucci syndrome is not the correct diagnosis.
* Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, eyes, and nervous system. It is characterized by the accumulation of a fatty substance called lipoid proteinosis in the skin, eyes, and nervous system. The condition can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, vision problems, and seizures. There is no cure for lipoid proteinosis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. However, the patient in the case does not have any skin lesions, vision problems, or seizures, so lipoid proteinosis is not the correct diagnosis.

  5%|▍         | 74/1525 [18:47<5:54:57, 14.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Start intravenous magnesium.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that is often associated with hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is a common electrolyte abnormality, especially in hospitalized patients. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including diuretic use, diarrhea, and alcoholism.

Magnesium is an important electrolyte for cardiac function. It helps to maintain the electrical stability of the heart and prevents the development of arrhythmias. Intravenous magnesium is the most effective way to treat hypomagnesemia and prevent TdP.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Discontinuation of metoprolol may not be enough to prevent TdP, especially if the patient has other risk factors for the arrhythmia. Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can also cause TdP. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is more effective than sotalol in preventing TdP, but it has a long list of side effects. Emergent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implant is only indicated for patients who have had a life-threatening arrhythmia, such as TdP.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Start intravenous magnesium. This is the most effective way to treat hypomagnesemia and prevent TdP.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute pulmonary edema, which is a medical emergency. The most common cause of acute pulmonary edema is left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which can occur in patients with mitral stenosis. The goals of treatment are to improve oxygenation, reduce pulmonary edema, and improve cardiac output.

100% Oxygen is given to improve oxygenation. Intravenous fluid is given to increase preload and cardiac output. Trendelenburg position is used to increase venous return and cardiac output.

Pericardiocentesis is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have signs of cardiac tamponade. Intravenous thrombolysis is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have signs of myocardial infarction. Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have signs of pulmonary embolism.

The following is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* A. Pericardiocentesis: Pericardiocentesis is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the pericardial sac to remove fluid. This is indicated in cases of cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition in which the pericardial sac fills with fluid, compressing the heart and preventing it from filling properly. The patient in this case does not have signs of cardiac tamponade, so pericardiocentesis is not indicated.
* B. Intravenous thrombolysis: Intravenous thrombolysis is a procedure in which a medication is given intravenously to dissolve a blood clot. This is indicated in cases of myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack. The patient in this case does not have signs of myocardial infarction, so intravenous thrombolysis is not indicated.
* C. Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy: Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and used to remove a blood clot. This is indicated in cases of pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage of a pulmonary artery by a blood clot. The patient in this case does not have signs of pulmonary embolism, so catheter-directed thromboembolectomy is not indicated.
* D. 100% Oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position: 100% Oxygen is given to improve oxygenation. Intravenous fluid is given to increase preload and cardiac output. Trendelenburg position is used to increase venous return and cardiac output. These are all indicated in cases of acute pulmonary edema, which is the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case.

  5%|▍         | 76/1525 [19:09<5:14:23, 13.02s/it]The correct answer is C: Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction.

The patient in this case has a history of persistent low-grade anterior uveitis after cataract surgery. She also has 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions. These findings are concerning for fungal keratitis, which is a serious infection of the cornea. Fungal keratitis is most commonly caused by exposure to contaminated water or soil. It is more common in people with diabetes, dry eyes, or a history of trauma to the eye.

The gold standard for diagnosing fungal keratitis is to obtain a sample of aqueous humor (the fluid that fills the front chamber of the eye) and perform a fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a highly sensitive test that can detect even small amounts of fungal DNA. If the PCR is positive, the patient can be treated with antifungal medications.

Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroids would not be helpful in this case, as corticosteroids can actually worsen fungal infections. Referral to an ocular oncologist is not necessary at this stage, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of malignancy. Obtaining a vitreous biopsy for bacterial culture is not necessary, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of endophthalmitis (an infection of the vitreous humor).

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction.

The patient has a history of mycosis fungoides, a type of skin cancer. He has also received radiation therapy and a stem cell transplant. These factors increase his risk of developing angiosarcoma, a rare type of cancer that can develop in the skin or other organs.

The patient's symptoms, including bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms, are consistent with angiosarcoma. The physical examination findings, including recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip and left lateral buttock, are also consistent with angiosarcoma.

The laboratory findings, including negative results for atypical infection, nocardia, and opportunistic fungal infection, are not consistent with these diagnoses.

The imaging findings, including negative results for PET CT evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease, are not consistent with these diagnoses.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is angiosarcoma.

Atypical infection, nocardia: This is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient has no history of infection with nocardia. Additionally, the physical examination findings, including recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip and left lateral buttock, are not consistent with infection with nocardia.

Opportunistic fungal infection: This is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient has no history of infection with an opportunistic fungus. Additionally, the physical examination findings, including recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip and left lateral buttock, are not consistent with infection with an opportunistic fungus.

Granulation tissue: This is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient has a history of mycosis fungoides, a type of skin cancer. Additionally, the physical examination findings, including recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip and left lateral buttock, are not consistent with granulation tissue.

  5%|▌         | 78/1525 [19:38<5:26:42, 13.55s/it]The correct answer is C. IgG4-related disease.

Graves disease is an autoimmune disease that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, hair loss, and eye problems. However, Graves disease typically does not cause orbital swelling or sinusitis.

Invasive fungal sinusitis is a serious infection that can cause inflammation and necrosis of the sinuses. This can lead to orbital swelling, proptosis, and vision loss. However, invasive fungal sinusitis is typically seen in immunocompromised patients, and the patient in this case does not have any known risk factors for this condition.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, eyes, skin, and heart. However, sarcoidosis typically does not cause orbital swelling or sinusitis.

IgG4-related disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect multiple organs, including the orbit, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, and lymph nodes. It is characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells into the affected tissues. This can lead to inflammation, fibrosis, and organ damage.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with IgG4-related disease, including:

* Orbital swelling
* Sinusitis
* Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels
* Elevated total IgG and IgG4 levels
* Nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates on orbital biopsy

The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based on a combination of clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment typically involves the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain all of the patient's features.

  5%|▌         | 79/1525 [19:53<5:34:50, 13.89s/it]The correct answer is B. Immunotherapy-related inflammation.

A. Infection and suppuration is incorrect because there is no evidence of infection in this case. The patient did not have fever, leukocytosis, or foul-smelling discharge. In addition, serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth.

C. Tumor progression is incorrect because the patient's tumor actually decreased in size after immunotherapy treatment. This is a known and expected side effect of immunotherapy, as the immune system becomes activated and attacks the tumor cells.

D. Allergic reaction is incorrect because there is no evidence of an allergic reaction in this case. The patient did not have any rash, hives, or itching. In addition, the patient did not report any history of allergies to any medications or treatments.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with immunotherapy-related inflammation. This is a known and expected side effect of immunotherapy, as the immune system becomes activated and attacks the tumor cells. The inflammation can cause redness, swelling, and drainage from the tumor site. In some cases, the inflammation can be severe enough to cause ulceration and necrosis of the tumor.

In this case, the patient's inflammation was mild and resolved spontaneously without the need for any treatment. However, in some cases, immunotherapy-related inflammation can be severe and require treatment with steroids or other medications.

  5%|▌         | 80/1525 [20:00<4:44:52, 11.83s/it]The correct answer is B. Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor. This is a rare benign tumor that most commonly occurs in the hands and feet of adults. It is characterized by the presence of hemosiderin, a pigment that is produced by the breakdown of red blood cells. Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumors are usually painless and slow-growing. They can be diagnosed with a biopsy, and they are usually treated by surgical excision.

A pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by the presence of pigmented cells. It is most common in people with dark skin. Pigmented epithelioid melanocytomas can be diagnosed with a biopsy, and they are usually treated with surgery or radiation therapy.

A pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by the presence of a pigmented papule or nodule. It is most common in people with dark skin. Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can be diagnosed with a biopsy, and it is usually treated with surgery or radiation therapy.

An angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma is a rare benign tumor that most commonly occurs in the skin and soft tissues of children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of blood vessels and histiocytes, which are cells that are involved in the immune system. Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas are usually painless and slow-growing. They can be diagnosed with a biopsy, and they are usually treated by surgical excision.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy woman in her 30s who presented with a painful bruise on her hand that initially appeared a few days after she sustained a twisting injury to the affected hand while participating in acroyoga 2 years before. Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain had persisted despite icing and resting the area. She denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand. Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor. This is supported by the patient's history of a painful bruise that has persisted for 2 years, the physical examination findings of an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque, the radiographic findings of soft tissue swelling, and the magnetic resonance imaging findings of a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. A pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by the presence of pigmented cells. It is most common in people with dark skin. However, the patient in this case does not have dark skin, and the lesion is not located on the skin. A pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by the presence of a pigmented papule or nodule. It is most common in people with dark skin. However, the patient in this case does not have dark skin, and the lesion is not located on the skin. An angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma is a rare benign tumor that most commonly occurs in the skin and soft tissues of children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of blood vessels and histiocytes, which are cells that are involved in the immune system. However, the patient in this case is an adult, and the lesion is not located in the skin or soft tissues.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination findings, radiographic findings, and magnetic resonance imaging findings.

  5%|▌         | 81/1525 [20:16<5:17:41, 13.20s/it]The correct answer is C. Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER).

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of endometrial adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy and recent postoperative radiotherapy. She presented with a pruritic rash that initially developed on her legs 13 days before presentation and subsequently progressed to her feet, arms, hands, and trunk. Associated symptoms included a burning sensation and occasional pain.

On physical examination, there were numerous erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques on the upper and lower extremities and scattered erythematous papules and plaques on the back and buttocks. Some plaques were annular and polycyclic in configuration, with central hyperpigmentation. Her chest, abdomen, face, and oral mucosa were clear.

A complete blood cell count was notable for an eosinophilia of 11%, with an absolute cell count of 0.80 ×103/uL. Results from a comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. A biopsy was performed on her right thigh for histopathological examination.

The histopathological findings showed a moderately dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells with innumerable eosinophils.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of EPPER. EPPER is a rare, self-limited skin eruption that occurs after radiation therapy. It is characterized by a pruritic rash that typically develops within 2 weeks of radiation therapy. The rash can be variable in appearance, but it often consists of erythematous papules and plaques. The rash is usually self-limited, resolving within 6-8 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EPPER, but topical corticosteroids and antihistamines can be used to relieve symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation.

* Radiation-induced bullous pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that can occur after radiation therapy. It is characterized by the development of bullae (blisters) on the skin.
* Urticarial vasculitis is a type of vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that can cause hives (urticaria). It is often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, arthralgia, and myalgia.
* Urticaria multiforme is a type of urticaria (hives) that is characterized by the development of target lesions. Target lesions are round or oval lesions with a central pale area surrounded by a red ring and a pale outer ring.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER).

  5%|▌         | 82/1525 [20:33<5:42:43, 14.25s/it]The correct answer is B. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET).

The patient in this case has a history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on ECG, which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. He experienced an episode of wide complex tachycardia that was refractory to amiodarone and required cardioversion. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries, which rules out coronary artery disease as a cause of his arrhythmia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement involving the right ventricular free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular anterior, septal, and apical segments. These findings are consistent with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, a condition that can cause ventricular arrhythmias.

Cardiac PET is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that can be used to assess myocardial perfusion and metabolism. In patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, cardiac PET can show evidence of myocardial ischemia or scar, which can be a source of ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac PET can also be used to assess the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

In this case, cardiac PET would be the most appropriate next step in management. Cardiac PET can help to identify the source of the patient's ventricular arrhythmias and assess his risk of sudden cardiac death. This information can then be used to guide further management, such as the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Discharge home after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: This is not the most appropriate next step in management because the patient's arrhythmias are not well-controlled. Cardiac PET would help to identify the source of the patient's arrhythmias and assess his risk of sudden cardiac death. This information can then be used to guide further management, such as the implantation of an ICD.
* C. Transthoracic echocardiogram: A transthoracic echocardiogram can be used to assess left ventricular systolic function and valvular function. However, it cannot be used to assess the source of ventricular arrhythmias or the risk of sudden cardiac death.
* D. Electrophysiology study: An electrophysiology study can be used to diagnose and treat ventricular arrhythmias. However, it cannot be used to assess the source of ventricular arrhythmias or the risk of sudden cardiac death.

  5%|▌         | 83/1525 [20:49<5:58:44, 14.93s/it]The correct answer is D. Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO syndrome).

SAPHO syndrome is a rare, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by synovitis (inflammation of the synovial lining of joints), acne, pustulosis (pustules on the skin), hyperostosis (abnormal bone growth), and osteitis (inflammation of bone).

The symptoms of SAPHO syndrome vary from person to person. Some people may only have a few of the symptoms, while others may have all of them. The most common symptoms are joint pain and swelling, acne, and pustules on the skin. Other symptoms may include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and hair loss.

The cause of SAPHO syndrome is unknown. However, it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, which means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.

There is no cure for SAPHO syndrome, but there are treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms. Treatment may include medication, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids, and physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove inflamed tissue or to correct bone abnormalities.

The prognosis for people with SAPHO syndrome varies depending on the severity of the disease. With treatment, most people can live relatively normal lives. However, some people may experience long-term joint pain and other problems.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the other choices are incorrect:

* Neurosyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It can affect the central nervous system, causing symptoms such as headache, neck stiffness, and seizures. The patient in the case does not have any of the symptoms of neurosyphilis, so this is not the correct diagnosis.
* Metastatic tumor is a type of cancer that has spread from its original site to another part of the body. The patient in the case does not have any of the symptoms of a metastatic tumor, so this is not the correct diagnosis.
* Rickettsial infection is a group of diseases caused by bacteria called Rickettsia. These diseases can cause fever, rash, and headache. The patient in the case does not have any of the symptoms of a rickettsial infection, so this is not the correct diagnosis.
It is reasoning
  6%|▌         | 84/1525 [21:04<5:59:20, 14.96s/it]The correct answer is A. Obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum.

The patient presented with a gray-white plaque on his soft palate that did not improve after treatment with 3 days of oral cefuroxime. He also reported a history of sexual contact with 1 male partner in the past 6 months. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum.

Syphilis is a multistage disease that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. The first stage of syphilis, primary syphilis, is characterized by the development of a painless chancre at the site of infection. The chancre usually resolves within 3 to 6 weeks, but the infection can progress to the secondary stage of syphilis, which is characterized by a rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The secondary stage of syphilis usually resolves within 2 to 6 weeks, but if left untreated, the infection can progress to the latent stage of syphilis, which is characterized by the absence of symptoms. The latent stage of syphilis can last for years or even decades, but it can eventually progress to the tertiary stage of syphilis, which is characterized by damage to the heart, brain, and other organs.

The diagnosis of syphilis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. The gold standard test for syphilis is the treponemal-specific antibody test, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test or the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) test. These tests are highly sensitive and specific for syphilis.

The treatment for syphilis is penicillin, which is given as a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. In patients who are allergic to penicillin, doxycycline or erythromycin can be used.

The patient in the case presentation should be tested for syphilis. If the test is positive, he should be treated with penicillin. He should also be counseled about the risks of sexual transmission of syphilis and the importance of using condoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque is not the correct answer because the diagnosis of syphilis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. A biopsy is not necessary to diagnose syphilis.
* C. Prescribe oral amoxicillin is not the correct answer because amoxicillin is not effective against syphilis. Penicillin is the only effective treatment for syphilis.
* D. Start topical nystatin is not the correct answer because nystatin is an antifungal medication that is used to treat fungal infections. Syphilis is not a fungal infection.

  6%|▌         | 85/1525 [21:19<5:58:43, 14.95s/it]The correct answer is C. Positron emission tomography scan (PET scan).

A PET scan is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that uses a radioactive tracer to measure metabolic activity in tissues. It is often used to diagnose cancer, as cancer cells tend to be more metabolically active than normal cells.

In the case of the 68-year-old man with an amelanotic choroidal lesion, a PET scan would be helpful in determining the nature of the lesion. If the lesion is malignant, the PET scan would show increased metabolic activity in the lesion. This information would be helpful in planning treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of tissue is removed from a lesion and examined under a microscope. This procedure is not always necessary to diagnose cancer, and it can be risky in some cases. Rituximab and radiotherapy are both treatments for cancer, but they would not be appropriate in this case without further information about the lesion. Plaque brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat cancer of the eye. It would not be appropriate in this case because the lesion is not in the eye.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Positron emission tomography scan. A PET scan would be helpful in determining the nature of the lesion and planning treatment.
It is reasoning
  6%|▌         | 86/1525 [21:31<5:36:26, 14.03s/it]The correct answer is D. Observe with no additional testing or intervention.

The patient has a history of breast and kidney cancer, and the lesion in her left eye is suspicious for metastatic disease. However, the lesion is amelanotic, which means it does not contain melanin. Melanoma, the most common type of eye cancer, is usually pigmented. Additionally, the lesion is located in the sclera, which is the white of the eye, and not the choroid, which is the layer of tissue beneath the retina. Choroidal metastases are more common than scleral metastases.

Given the patient's history and the appearance of the lesion, it is more likely that the lesion is benign. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) could be performed to confirm the diagnosis, but this would carry a risk of bleeding and infection. Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy or intravitreal methotrexate are both treatments for choroidal metastases, but they would not be appropriate for a benign lesion.

The best course of action is to observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention. If the lesion grows or changes in appearance, then further testing can be performed. However, given the patient's history and the appearance of the lesion, it is more likely that the lesion is benign and will not require treatment.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why each of the other choices is incorrect:

A. Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics: This is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of bleeding and infection. It is not necessary in this case, as the lesion is more likely to be benign.

B. Perform iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy: This is a treatment for choroidal metastases, but it would not be appropriate for a benign lesion.

C. Initiate intravitreal methotrexate: This is a treatment for choroidal metastases, but it would not be appropriate for a benign lesion.

D. Observe with no additional testing or intervention: This is the best course of action in this case, as the lesion is more likely to be benign and will not require treatment.

  6%|▌         | 87/1525 [21:44<5:28:16, 13.70s/it]The correct diagnosis is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). This is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that accounts for about 1-5% of all breast cancers. IBC is characterized by a rapidly spreading rash and swelling of the breast, often with no palpable lump. The rash is typically red, purple, or blue and may be warm to the touch. It can also be itchy or painful. Swelling of the breast can be severe and may cause the breast to look enlarged and dimpled. In some cases, IBC can also spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit.

The cause of IBC is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for IBC include being overweight or obese, having a family history of breast cancer, and having a history of certain genetic mutations.

The diagnosis of IBC is made based on a physical examination, imaging tests, and biopsy. Imaging tests such as mammography, ultrasound, and MRI can help to determine the extent of the cancer. A biopsy is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of IBC. A biopsy involves removing a small piece of tissue from the breast and examining it under a microscope.

The treatment for IBC typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery may be used to remove the cancerous tissue from the breast. Chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body. Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells that remain after surgery and chemotherapy.

The prognosis for women with IBC is generally poor. The 5-year survival rate for IBC is about 20%. However, with early detection and treatment, the survival rate for IBC can be improved.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare type of skin cancer that usually occurs in older adults. It is characterized by a rapidly growing mass of blood vessels on the skin. The mass may be red, purple, or blue and may be painful or itchy. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is not typically associated with a rash or swelling of the breast.
* Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is an inflammatory condition of the blood vessels that can affect the skin, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by a rash of small red or purple spots on the skin. The rash may be itchy or painful. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is not typically associated with a rash or swelling of the breast.
* Primary adnexal gland carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the glands that produce sweat, oil, and hair. It is typically found in the skin of the head and neck. Primary adnexal gland carcinoma is not typically associated with a rash or swelling of the breast.

Madelung disease is a rare, noncancerous (benign) disorder that causes the accumulation of fat in the neck, upper back, and shoulders. It is also known as lipomatosis cervicalis or Launois-Bensaude syndrome.

The cause of Madelung disease is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is more common in men than women, and it usually occurs in people who are middle-aged or older.

The symptoms of Madelung disease vary from person to person. The most common symptom is a large, fatty mass in the neck. This mass can be painful and may make it difficult to swallow or breathe. Other symptoms may include:

* Fat deposits in the upper back and shoulders
* A thick neck
* A double chin
* Swelling of the face and hands
* High blood pressure
* Diabetes
* Heart disease

There is no cure for Madelung disease, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments include:

* Surgery to remove the fatty mass
* Medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol
* Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and quitting smoking

The prognosis for people with Madelung disease is generally good. However, the disorder can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease and stroke.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms or condition.

* Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in fat cells. It is usually found in the abdomen, but it can also occur in the neck.

Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN) is a rare, congenital skin disorder characterized by linear verrucous plaques that are often pruritic and inflamed. The lesions typically occur on the trunk and extremities, and they may be associated with other anomalies, such as alopecia, nail dystrophy, and dental abnormalities. The histopathology of ILVEN shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of spiny keratotic papules on the face, scalp, and trunk. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with alopecia. The histopathology of trichodysplasia spinulosa shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and trichodysplasia, which is a disorder of hair shaft formation.

Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PKODN) is a rare, congenital skin disorder characterized by linear hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs. The lesions typically occur on the face, trunk, and extremities, and they may be associated with alopecia. The histopathology of PKODN shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and parakeratotic columns overlying the dilated epidermal invaginations, as well as thinner granular layers and dilated eccrine ostia and acrosyringia under the parakeratotic columns.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis (MMDH) is a rare, acquired skin disorder characterized by multiple, small, digitate hyperkeratotic papules on the hands and feet. The lesions are often asymptomatic and may be associated with other skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema. The histopathology of MMDH shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and parakeratosis.

In the case presented, the patient has generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous central white spicules and comedo-like plugs that were in a linear distribution on his face, trunk, and extremities since birth. Some of the eruptions on his trunk had spontaneously resolved with developmental growth. There was nonconsanguineous marriage of his parents, and no family members had similar lesions. The patient was otherwise in good general health and without developmental delay. Physical examination showed generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous central small filiform keratotic white spicules and brown plugs on the head, face, neck, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figure, A and B), including his palms and soles along Blaschko lines, accompanied with alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. The examination of nails, mucosae, and teeth was unremarkable. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. Dermoscopic examination showed many central white spines on the face (Figure, C) and brown cores surrounded by yellow crater-like rings on the right palm. A skin biopsy specimen was taken from the hyperkeratotic papules with white spicules on his right thigh (Figure, D).

The clinical presentation of the patient is most consistent with PKODN. The lesions are linear in distribution, which is a characteristic feature of PKODN. The lesions are also associated with alopecia, which is another characteristic feature of PKODN. The histopathology of the skin biopsy specimen shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and parakeratotic columns overlying the dilated epidermal invaginations, as well as thinner granular layers and dilated eccrine ostia and acrosyringia under the parakeratotic columns. This histopathology is also consistent with PKODN.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical presentation of the patient. ILVEN is characterized by linear verrucous plaques that are often pruritic and inflamed. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is characterized by the formation of spiny keratotic papules on the face, scalp, and trunk. MMDH is characterized by multiple, small, digitate hyperkeratotic papules on the hands and feet.

LCH is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in children under the age of 10. The symptoms of LCH vary depending on the organs or tissues involved. The most common symptoms are skin lesions, bone lesions, and lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes). Other possible symptoms include fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of LCH is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. A skin biopsy is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for LCH depends on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In more severe cases, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.

The prognosis for LCH is generally good. With early diagnosis and treatment, most people with LCH have a good long-term outcome. However, some people with LCH may have long-term problems, such as growth retardation or bone deformities.

* Behçet disease is a chronic, relapsing autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. It is most common in people of Middle Eastern descent. The diagnosis of Behçet disease is based on clinical findings and laboratory tests. Treatment for Behçet disease is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications. There is no cure for Behçet disease.
* Metastatic Crohn disease is a rare complication of Crohn disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In metastatic Crohn disease, Crohn disease lesions spread to other organs, such as the liver, lungs, and bones. The diagnosis of metastatic Crohn disease is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for metastatic Crohn disease is challenging and may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.
* Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. CTCL is a group of several related diseases that share some common features. The most common type of CTCL is mycosis fungoides, which typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin. Other types of CTCL include Sézary syndrome, which is characterized by generalized erythroderma (redness of the skin), and lymphomatoid papulosis, which is characterized by recurrent crops of papules (small, raised bumps). The diagnosis of CTCL is based on a biopsy of the skin lesion. Treatment for CTCL depends on the type and stage of the disease.

  6%|▌         | 91/1525 [22:51<6:22:47, 16.02s/it]The correct answer is B. Pacemaker implantation.

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass graft 10 years ago. He presented with recurrent presyncope and bradycardia. Review of prior physician encounters revealed reports of lightheadedness and electrocardiograms (ECGs) with atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute. Current medications included carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB). Comparison of current (A) and past (B) electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. Telemetry revealed heart rates of 50 to 60 beats per minute, which did not change with activity. Findings of echocardiography were unremarkable.

The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with sick sinus syndrome, a condition characterized by sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, and/or sinoatrial node dysfunction. The patient's current medications, carvedilol and apixaban, are not likely to be the cause of his symptoms.

The treatment for sick sinus syndrome is pacemaker implantation. A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest and sends electrical impulses to the heart to regulate the heart rate. Pacemaker implantation is a safe and effective procedure that can improve the patient's symptoms and quality of life.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is a test that is used to monitor the heart rhythm over a period of time. This test would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are clearly related to his slow heart rate. Exercise treadmill test is a test that is used to assess the patient's ability to exercise. This test would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not related to his exercise tolerance. Electrophysiology study is a test that is used to assess the electrical activity of the heart. This test would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are clearly related to his slow heart rate.

  6%|▌         | 92/1525 [23:06<6:18:13, 15.84s/it]The correct answer is D. Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy.

Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the presence of nemaline rods (rod-shaped structures) in muscle tissue. It is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in muscle contraction. The disorder typically presents in adults with progressive weakness of the proximal muscles, including the neck, shoulders, and hips. Other features may include muscle cramps, fatigue, and difficulty swallowing. There is no cure for sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medications to improve muscle strength and function.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen-storage disease type 2) is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissue. It is caused by mutations in the GAA gene, which encodes the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. The disorder typically presents in infants and young children with progressive weakness of the proximal muscles, including the neck, shoulders, and hips. Other features may include respiratory problems, heart failure, and liver enlargement. There is no cure for late-onset Pompe disease, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. This may include enzyme replacement therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.
* Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles. It is caused by antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The disorder typically presents in young adults with fluctuating weakness of the eye muscles, facial muscles, and muscles of the limbs. Other features may include double vision, ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), difficulty swallowing, and difficulty speaking. There is no cure for myasthenia gravis, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. This may include medications to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to remove the antibodies from the blood.
* Paraneoplastic myositis is a rare, autoimmune disorder that occurs in people with cancer. It is caused by antibodies that attack the muscle cells. The disorder typically presents with progressive weakness of the proximal muscles, including the neck, shoulders, and hips. Other features may include muscle cramps, fatigue, and difficulty swallowing. There is no cure for paraneoplastic myositis, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. This may include medications to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and treatment of the underlying cancer.

  6%|▌         | 93/1525 [23:23<6:25:23, 16.15s/it]The correct answer is B. Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including hypertension, obesity, and a history of snoring. She also has a number of symptoms consistent with OSA, such as fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness.

Home sleep testing is a relatively new technology that allows for the diagnosis of OSA in the home setting. It is less expensive and more convenient than laboratory-based polysomnography, and it is just as accurate in diagnosing OSA.

The results of the home sleep test in this case show that the patient has severe OSA. She has an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 40 events per hour, which is more than five times the threshold for a diagnosis of OSA. She also has a low oxygen saturation nadir of 83%, which is a sign of significant hypoxemia.

CPAP therapy is the gold standard treatment for OSA. It involves the use of a machine that delivers a continuous stream of pressurized air through a mask that is worn over the nose and mouth. The pressurized air helps to keep the airway open during sleep, preventing apnea and hypopnea events.

CPAP therapy has been shown to be very effective in treating OSA. It can improve sleep quality, reduce daytime sleepiness, and improve blood pressure control. It can also reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious complications.

In this case, the patient has a number of risk factors for OSA and a positive home sleep test result. She is also experiencing a number of symptoms consistent with OSA. Based on this information, the best course of treatment is to initiate CPAP therapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, Advise use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position, is incorrect because it is not a definitive treatment for OSA. A wedge pillow may help to reduce the number of apnea events during sleep, but it is not as effective as CPAP therapy.
* Option C, Perform laboratory-based polysomnography, is incorrect because the patient has already undergone a home sleep test, which is a reliable and accurate test for OSA.
* Option D, Repeat the home sleep apnea test, is incorrect because the patient has already had a positive home sleep test result. There is no need to repeat the test unless the patient's symptoms worsen or the treatment response is inadequate.

  6%|▌         | 94/1525 [23:33<5:37:34, 14.15s/it]The correct answer is B: Perform systemic workup, including chest imaging.

The patient has a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids. He also has mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes.

During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye.

The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for a systemic illness, such as sarcoidosis, that could be causing the glaucoma progression. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect the eyes, lungs, skin, heart, and other organs. The most common ocular manifestation of sarcoidosis is uveitis, which can cause pain, redness, and inflammation in the eye. Sarcoidosis can also cause glaucoma, which is a condition that occurs when the pressure in the eye becomes too high, damaging the optic nerve and causing vision loss.

In order to rule out a systemic illness, the patient should undergo a systemic workup, including chest imaging. Chest imaging, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, can help to detect the presence of granulomas, which are characteristic of sarcoidosis. If granulomas are detected, the patient may need to undergo further testing, such as a biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's glaucoma progression. Option A, discontinuing fluorometholone eye drops, would not be effective in treating the patient's sarcoidosis. Option C, adding netarsudil eye drops, is a treatment for glaucoma, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's glaucoma progression. Option D, placing a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser, is a surgical treatment for glaucoma, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's glaucoma progression.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Perform systemic workup, including chest imaging.

  6%|▌         | 95/1525 [23:44<5:15:50, 13.25s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy.

The patient has a right retro-orbital intraconal lesion that is causing proptosis, hyperglobus, supraduction deficit, conjunctival injection, grade IV optic disc edema, and choroidal folds. The lesion is likely a dermoid/epidermoid cyst, which is a benign tumor that can cause significant morbidity if it is not removed.

Admitting the patient to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics is not the correct answer because the patient does not have an infection. There is no evidence of infection on the MRI or on the patient's clinical examination.

Ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test is not the correct answer because these tests are used to screen for pheochromocytoma, which is a rare adrenal tumor that can cause hypertension. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms of pheochromocytoma, and the MRI does not show any evidence of a mass in the adrenal glands.

Starting high-dose steroids is not the correct answer because steroids can suppress the immune system and make the patient more susceptible to infection. The patient does not have an infection, and there is no evidence that steroids would be beneficial in this case.

Performing an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy is the correct answer because this is the only way to definitively diagnose the lesion and to determine if it is malignant. The patient is at risk of significant morbidity if the lesion is not removed, and the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks.

  6%|▋         | 96/1525 [23:57<5:17:37, 13.34s/it]The correct diagnosis is Rosai-Dorfman disease. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, non-neoplastic, histiocytic disorder that can affect any organ system. The most common presentation is cervical lymphadenopathy, often with fever, malaise, and weight loss. Other common findings include skin lesions, bone lesions, and orbital masses. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathologic examination, which shows a proliferation of benign-appearing histiocytes with emperipolesis. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for S100 and negative for CD1a.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Castleman disease is a rare, multisystem lymphoproliferative disorder that can present with lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue. It is characterized by a proliferation of B cells and plasma cells in lymph nodes and other organs. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathologic examination, which shows a proliferation of B cells and plasma cells with storiform fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for CD20 and CD38.
* Inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare, non-neoplastic, inflammatory disorder that can affect any organ system. The most common presentation is a mass in the lung, orbit, or brain.

Oral hairy leukoplakia is a white lesion on the tongue that is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause pain or burning. Oral hairy leukoplakia is not cancerous.

Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precancerous condition of the squamous cells that line the mouth. It is most common in people who smoke or use tobacco products. The lesions are typically small, red or white patches that may be raised or flat. Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ is not usually painful, but it can sometimes cause bleeding.

Herpetic infection is a viral infection that causes blisters on the lips or mouth. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The blisters are typically painful and may be accompanied by fever, headache, and swollen lymph nodes. Herpetic infection is contagious and can be spread through contact with the blisters or through contact with saliva.

The patient in the case presented with painful lesions on the tongue that had been present for at least 3 months. The lesions were bilateral and raised, with a slightly hairy appearance. The patient also had a history of oral and anal intercourse. These findings are consistent with secondary syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Secondary syphilis typically presents with a rash that can involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. The rash is often described as "macular" or "papular," and it can be widespread or localized. Other symptoms of secondary syphilis may include fever, fatigue, headache, and lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of secondary syphilis is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Laboratory testing can confirm the diagnosis, and it can also be used to determine the stage of the infection. Treatment for secondary syphilis typically involves a single dose of penicillin. With treatment, the symptoms of secondary syphilis usually resolve within a few weeks. However, if left untreated, secondary syphilis can progress to tertiary syphilis, which is a more serious and potentially life-threatening condition.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation. Oral hairy leukoplakia is a white lesion on the tongue that is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause pain or burning.

OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to create detailed cross-sectional images of the retina. It is a very sensitive test that can detect subtle changes in the retina, such as those that may be caused by COVID-19 infection.

Genetic testing is not a necessary test in this case, as there is no known genetic link to the visual symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It can be used to diagnose retinal diseases, but it is not as sensitive as OCT in detecting early changes in the retina. Fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a dye to visualize blood vessels in the retina. It can be used to diagnose retinal diseases, but it is not as sensitive as OCT in detecting early changes in the retina.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to create detailed cross-sectional images of the retina.

Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp is a rare, non-scarring hair loss disorder that is characterized by diffuse, short, sparse hair over the entire scalp. The hair is usually lanugolike, meaning that it is fine and downy. The disorder is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood. There is no known cause for hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp, and it is not associated with any other medical problems. The treatment is usually not necessary, but hair transplantation may be an option for some people.

Short anagen syndrome is a rare, genetic hair loss disorder that is characterized by short anagen hairs. Anagen hairs are the growing phase of hair follicles, and short anagen hairs are those that do not reach their full growth potential. The disorder is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood. There is no known cure for short anagen syndrome, but treatment options include hair transplantation and medications to stimulate hair growth.

Loose anagen syndrome is a rare, genetic hair loss disorder that is characterized by loose anagen hairs. Loose anagen hairs are those that are easily pulled out of the scalp. The disorder is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood. There is no known cure for loose anagen syndrome, but treatment options include hair transplantation and medications to stimulate hair growth.

Trichodental dysplasia is a rare, genetic disorder that is characterized by hair loss, tooth abnormalities, and other developmental problems. The disorder is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood. There is no known cure for trichodental dysplasia, and treatment options are limited.

In the case of the school-aged girl, the most likely diagnosis is hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp. The girl has a history of diffuse, short, sparse hair over the entire scalp since the age of 1 year. She has no other medical problems, and there is no known family history of hair loss. The hair pull test was positive with predominately anagen hair extracted, and light microscopy of scalp hair shafts revealed no structural abnormalities. The punch biopsy showed a mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and increased telogen hair with decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio. These findings are consistent with hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp.

Short anagen syndrome, loose anagen syndrome, and trichodental dysplasia are all rare, genetic hair loss disorders that are characterized by different clinical features. Short anagen syndrome is characterized by short anagen hairs, loose anagen syndrome is characterized by loose anagen hairs, and trichodental dysplasia is characterized by hair loss, tooth abnormalities, and other developmental problems. The girl in the case does not have any of the clinical features of these disorders, so they are not the most likely diagnoses.

EPPP is a rare, chronic, papular dermatosis that is characterized by the sudden eruption of intensely pruritic, annular or polycyclic papules on the extremities. The lesions are typically 2-5 mm in diameter and are often surrounded by a collarette of scale. The palms, soles, and mucous membranes are typically spared. EPPP is most common in middle-aged and elderly adults, and there is no gender predilection. The etiology of EPPP is unknown, but it is thought to be a reactive process. There is no specific treatment for EPPP, but topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral antihistamines can be used to relieve the pruritus.

Annular lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by flat-topped, polygonal, pruritic papules that often form annular or polycyclic lesions. The lesions are typically found on the wrists, forearms, and shins, but can occur anywhere on the skin. Lichen planus is more common in women than men, and typically affects people between the ages of 30 and 60. The cause of lichen planus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. There is no cure for lichen planus, but treatment can help to relieve the symptoms. Topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral antihistamines can be used to reduce the itching and inflammation.

Perforating granuloma annulare is a rare, chronic, granulomatous skin disease characterized by the formation of small, annular or serpiginous papules that often ulcerate and leave atrophic scars. The lesions are typically found on the hands, feet, and lower legs, but can occur anywhere on the skin. Perforating granuloma annulare is more common in women than men, and typically affects people between the ages of 20 and 40. The cause of perforating granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. There is no cure for perforating granuloma annulare, but treatment can help to improve the appearance of the skin. Topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral retinoids can be used to reduce the inflammation and scarring.

Atypical pityriasis rosea is a common, self-limiting skin rash characterized by a herald patch followed by a widespread eruption of scaly papules and plaques. The herald patch is typically a single, oval, scaly lesion that is 2-10 cm in diameter. The widespread eruption of papules and plaques is typically found on the trunk and proximal extremities, but can occur anywhere on the skin. Atypical pityriasis rosea is more common in children and young adults, and typically affects people between the ages of 10 and 35. The cause of atypical pityriasis rosea is unknown, but it is thought to be a viral infection. There is no specific treatment for atypical pityriasis rosea, but the rash typically resolves on its own within 6-8 weeks.

The patient in the case has a strong family history of premature cardiovascular disease, including his father and older brother who both had myocardial infarctions at a young age. He also has elevated lipoprotein(a), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In addition, he is of South Asian ancestry, which is another risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Based on these factors, the patient is at high risk for cardiovascular disease. He should be counseled on lifestyle modifications, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. He should also be started on high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily.

In addition, the patient's first-degree relatives should be screened for elevated lipoprotein(a) and other cardiovascular risk factors. This is known as cascade screening. Cascade screening is important because it can identify people who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and who may benefit from early intervention.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because it does not address the patient's other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as his family history and his elevated lipoprotein(a). Option B is incorrect because it does not address the patient's modifiable risk factors, such as his smoking and diet.

Mitochondrial ataxia is a group of neurological disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. These mutations can cause a variety of symptoms, including ataxia (loss of coordination), seizures, hearing loss, vision loss, and dementia.

The patient in the case report has a number of features that are consistent with mitochondrial ataxia, including:

* Progressive imbalance while walking and intense fear of falling
* Gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes
* Ataxic dysarthria
* Tone was normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes were absent and plantar fascia were mute
* Limb power was normal
* Ataxia was seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests
* Chorea was present in both legs
* Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes was noted
* Electromyography revealed sensory neuronopathy
* On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy was noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus

Friedreich ataxia is a progressive, hereditary ataxia caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene. It is characterized by ataxia, weakness, and sensory loss. The patient in the case report does not have the typical features of Friedreich ataxia, such as scoliosis and cardiomyopathy.

Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. It is characterized by tremor, ataxia, and intellectual disability. The patient in the case report does not have the typical features of Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, such as macroorchidism.

Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the NPC1 gene. It is characterized by the accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, including the brain. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including ataxia, seizures, and cognitive impairment. The patient in the case report does not have the typical features of Niemann-Pick disease type C, such as hepatosplenomegaly and cherry-red spots in the retina.

In conclusion, the patient in the case report has a number of features that are consistent with mitochondrial ataxia. The other answer choices are less likely to be the correct diagnosis.

The patient is experiencing pain in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen. This is a common location for appendicitis, which is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. Injecting a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness can help to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. If the pain is relieved by the injection, it is likely that the patient has appendicitis. However, if the pain is not relieved, other possible causes of the pain should be considered.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Administering gabapentin is not a recommended treatment for appendicitis. Gabapentin is a medication used to treat seizures and nerve pain. It is not effective in treating appendicitis.
* B. Assessing celiac artery flow is not a recommended diagnostic test for appendicitis. Celiac artery flow is a measure of blood flow to the small intestine. It is not a useful test for appendicitis.
* D. Measuring urine porphobilinogen level is not a recommended diagnostic test for appendicitis. Porphobilinogen is a substance that is produced when the body breaks down heme, a protein that is found in red blood cells. Measuring urine porphobilinogen level is not a useful test for appendicitis.

The patient in the case report presents with a number of symptoms that are consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, including persistent fever and cough, vesiculobullous skin lesions, and erosions on the lips and oral mucosa. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory infections in children, and it can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, pneumonia, and rash. The diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is usually made based on clinical presentation and laboratory testing. Laboratory testing can include serologic testing to detect the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. IgM antibodies are produced during the acute infection, while IgG antibodies are produced later in the infection and can persist for years.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Carry out pathergy test for Behçet disease. Behçet disease is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. The pathergy test is a skin test that is used to diagnose Behçet disease. The test is performed by injecting a small amount of saline solution into the skin. If the patient has Behçet disease, they will develop a small papule or pustule at the injection site within 24 hours. The pathergy test is not specific for Behçet disease, and it can be positive in other conditions, such as pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet syndrome.
* Answer C: Perform an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create an image of the heart. The test is used to diagnose a variety of heart conditions, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects. An echocardiogram is not necessary to diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
* Answer D: Test for monkeypox virus. Monkeypox is a viral disease that is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is found in wild animals, such as monkeys and apes, and it can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. Monkeypox can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. The rash can progress from flat red spots to raised bumps that fill with fluid and then scab over. Monkeypox is a rare disease, and it is not usually seen in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who have been exposed to monkeypox or who have symptoms of monkeypox should be tested for the virus.

  7%|▋         | 105/1525 [26:14<6:02:47, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is A. Administer empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics.

The patient in the case presented with a 1-day history of severe abdominal pain and cloudy PD fluid. She had a history of PD for kidney failure due to IgA nephropathy. Seven days prior, she inadvertently broke aseptic technique when tightening a leaking connection of her PD catheter tubing. On presentation, she was afebrile and had normal vital signs. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness. Cloudy fluid that was drained from her PD catheter was sent for laboratory analysis.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is peritonitis, which is an infection of the peritoneal cavity. The most common cause of peritonitis in PD patients is bacterial infection. The most common bacteria that cause peritonitis in PD patients are gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The initial treatment of peritonitis in PD patients is empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. The antibiotics should be given intraperitoneally, which means that they are instilled into the peritoneal cavity through the PD catheter. Intraperitoneal antibiotics are more effective than intravenous antibiotics in treating peritonitis in PD patients.

The patient in the case should be started on empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics as soon as possible. The antibiotics should be continued until the culture results are available. If the culture results are positive, the antibiotics should be changed to the antibiotics that are most effective against the infecting organism.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

B. Administer empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is incorrect. Intravenous antibiotics are not as effective as intraperitoneal antibiotics in treating peritonitis in PD patients.

C. Await peritoneal dialysis fluid culture results before starting intraperitoneal antibiotics is incorrect. This is because the patient is at risk of developing sepsis and death if treatment is delayed.

D. Send blood cultures is incorrect. Blood cultures are not necessary in all cases of peritonitis in PD patients. Blood cultures should be sent if the patient has fever or if the patient is clinically unstable.

Arnold-Chiari malformation is a congenital disorder that affects the structure of the brain and spinal cord. It is not caused by surgery and would not have presented 5 months after surgery.

Spinal abscess causing laryngeal edema is a rare complication of spinal surgery. It would be expected to present within days or weeks of surgery, not 5 months later.

Idiopathic bilateral vocal fold paralysis is a condition of unknown cause. It is not associated with surgery and would not have presented 5 months after surgery.

Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis is a condition that can occur after surgery on the neck. It is caused by damage to the nerves that control the vocal folds. The patient in the case presented with symptoms of bilateral vocal fold paralysis 5 months after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. The diagnosis was confirmed by laryngoscopic examination and a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast. The patient was treated with vocal fold medialization and made a good recovery.

The other three choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the results of the investigations.

  7%|▋         | 107/1525 [26:42<5:51:03, 14.85s/it]The correct answer is A. Observation.

The patient has a pigmented iris lesion that has been present for decades and has remained stable in size. The lesion is small, without prominent internal vasculature, and does not involve the angle or ciliary body. These features are characteristic of a benign lesion, such as a nevus.

A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not necessary in this case because the lesion is small and has a low risk of malignancy. FNAB can be helpful in diagnosing suspicious lesions, but it is not necessary in this case because the lesion is benign.

Plaque brachytherapy is a treatment option for malignant iris tumors, but it is not necessary in this case because the lesion is benign. Plaque brachytherapy is a procedure in which a radioactive plaque is placed on the surface of the eye to deliver radiation to the tumor.

Iridectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a portion of the iris. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including malignant iris tumors. However, iridectomy is not necessary in this case because the lesion is benign.

Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the lesion closely and repeat the ultrasound biomicroscopy in 6 months. If the lesion grows or changes in appearance, then further evaluation may be necessary.

Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Treatment for cutaneous sarcoidosis is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. This may include medications, such as corticosteroids, and surgery to remove affected tissue.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that affects the lymph nodes, skin, lungs, and other organs. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells. The cause of lymphomatoid granulomatosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Treatment for lymphomatoid granulomatosis is aimed at controlling the disease and preventing complications. This may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare, aggressive type of blood cancer. It is characterized by the proliferation of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The cause of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. Treatment for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is aimed at controlling the disease and preventing complications. This may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive type of lymphoma that affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of atypical lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. The cause of cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. Treatment for cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is aimed at controlling the disease and preventing complications. This may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

The patient in the case presented with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. He denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors. Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins. The platelet count (161 × 103/μL; normal range, 125-350 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0]) and lactate dehydrogenase (217 U/L; normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]) were normal. Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA showed high loads of virus in the peripheral blood (846 copies/mL in serum, 27 700 copies/mL in lymphocytes; normal range, <500 copies/mL). A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule was sent for histopathologic examination.

The histopathologic examination showed infiltration of atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes with proliferation of high endothelial venules. In situ hybridization was positive for Epstein-Barr virus in the skin.

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic examination are all consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic examination.

  7%|▋         | 109/1525 [27:14<6:08:04, 15.60s/it]The correct answer is D. Nodular colloid degeneration.

Verrucous xanthoma is a rare, benign, skin condition characterized by the presence of warty, yellowish papules or plaques. It is most commonly seen on the palms and soles, but can also occur on other areas of the body, including the tongue. The cause of verrucous xanthoma is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a disorder of lipid metabolism. The condition is usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause pain or discomfort. Treatment is not always necessary, but if the lesions are bothersome, they can be removed by surgical excision or laser therapy.

Colloid milium–classic adult type is a rare, benign, skin condition characterized by the presence of small, white papules or nodules. It is most commonly seen on the face, but can also occur on other areas of the body, including the tongue. The cause of colloid milium–classic adult type is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a disorder of keratinization. The condition is usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause pain or discomfort. Treatment is not always necessary, but if the lesions are bothersome, they can be removed by surgical excision or laser therapy.

Nodular amyloidosis is a rare, chronic, systemic disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in various organs and tissues. The most common organs affected are the kidneys, heart, and liver. Amyloidosis can also affect the tongue, where it can cause the development of nodular lesions. The cause of nodular amyloidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a genetic mutation. The condition is usually progressive and can lead to death. Treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications.

Nodular colloid degeneration is a rare, benign, oral condition characterized by the presence of nodular lesions on the tongue. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause pain or discomfort. The cause of nodular colloid degeneration is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a disorder of metabolism. The condition is usually self-limiting, but can sometimes persist for several years. Treatment is not always necessary, but if the lesions are bothersome, they can be removed by surgical excision or laser therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma treated with total gastrectomy. He presents with asymptomatic lesions on his tongue that gradually developed during the previous 3 months. Intraoral examination revealed multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface on both sides of his tongue. The skin of the face, neck, arms, and other sun-exposed areas did not reveal any associated lesions. He reported occasional alcohol intake, and there was no history of tobacco-related habits or oral trauma. The results of laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count, serum chemistry panel, liver and kidney function test, C-reactive protein levels, lipid profile, and serum and urine electrophoresis disclosed no abnormalities. With the clinical suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, an incisional biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination showed circumscribed eosinophilic, amorphous fissured masses in the subepithelial connective tissue. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of nodular colloid degeneration.

The other possible diagnoses, verrucous xanthoma, colloid milium–classic adult type, and nodular amyloidosis, are all less likely in this case. Verrucous xanthoma is usually seen on the palms and soles, not the tongue. Colloid milium–classic adult type is also usually seen on the face, not the tongue. Nodular amyloidosis can affect the tongue, but it is usually associated with other systemic symptoms, such as kidney disease, heart disease, and liver disease.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in the case presented is nodular colloid degeneration.

  7%|▋         | 110/1525 [27:31<6:13:45, 15.85s/it]The correct answer is C. Cutaneous protothecosis.

Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by dematiaceous fungi of the order Onygenales. The most common species involved are Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, and Cladosporium carrionii. The infection is typically acquired by traumatic implantation of the fungus into the skin, often through an open wound. The lesions are typically verrucous or nodular and may be ulcerated. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and culture. Treatment is with antifungal drugs, such as itraconazole or voriconazole.

Cutaneous cryptococcosis is a fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. The infection is typically acquired by inhalation of the fungus, which is found in soil and bird droppings. The lesions are typically papular or nodular and may be ulcerated. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and culture. Treatment is with antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B or fluconazole.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection of the skin caused by Leishmania species. The infection is typically acquired by the bite of an infected sandfly. The lesions are typically papular or nodular and may be ulcerated. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and culture. Treatment is with antimonial drugs, such as meglumine antimoniate or sodium stibogluconate.

In the case presented, the patient has a large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaque with purulent discharge and crusting on the back of the left forearm. The lesions are typical of cutaneous protothecosis. The patient also has a history of self-medication with topical herbal medicine, which is a risk factor for cutaneous protothecosis. The biopsy specimen shows hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and a small amount of multinucleated giant cells in the dermis. This is also consistent with cutaneous protothecosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by culture of the fungus Prototheca wickerhamii from the biopsy specimen.

The other choices are incorrect because the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings are not typical of these diseases.

  7%|▋         | 111/1525 [27:47<6:18:58, 16.08s/it]The correct answer is C: Perform coronary angiography. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with coronary artery disease, as are his laboratory findings (elevated troponin T and LDL cholesterol). A dobutamine stress echocardiogram may be useful in diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate as coronary angiography. Reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours would not be helpful, as the patient's troponin T level is already elevated. Discharge home with outpatient cardiology follow-up would be premature, as the patient is at risk for an acute coronary event. Therefore, the best course of action is to perform coronary angiography to assess the patient's coronary arteries and determine the need for further treatment.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* Discharge home with outpatient cardiology follow-up: This would be premature, as the patient is at risk for an acute coronary event. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with coronary artery disease, as are his laboratory findings (elevated troponin T and LDL cholesterol). A dobutamine stress echocardiogram may be useful in diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate as coronary angiography. Reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours would not be helpful, as the patient's troponin T level is already elevated. Therefore, the best course of action is to perform coronary angiography to assess the patient's coronary arteries and determine the need for further treatment.
* Order a dobutamine stress echocardiogram: This may be useful in diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate as coronary angiography. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a test that uses an echocardiogram to look at the heart's function while the patient is given a medication called dobutamine. Dobutamine is a medication that makes the heart beat faster and stronger. This allows the doctor to see if the patient's heart is getting enough blood. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram can be helpful in diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate as coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is a test that uses a special dye to look at the inside of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. Coronary angiography is the most accurate test for diagnosing coronary artery disease.
* Reorder troponin T measurement in 3 hours: This would not be helpful, as the patient's troponin T level is already elevated. Troponin T is a protein that is released into the blood when heart muscle cells are damaged. An elevated troponin T level is a sign of a heart attack. The patient's troponin T level is already elevated, so reordering the test in 3 hours would not provide any additional information.
* Perform coronary angiography: This is the best course of action, as it will allow the doctor to assess the patient's coronary arteries and determine the need for further treatment. Coronary angiography is a test that uses a special dye to look at the inside of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. Coronary angiography is the most accurate test for diagnosing coronary artery disease. It can also be used to determine the extent of the blockage and to identify the best treatment option.

  7%|▋         | 112/1525 [28:00<5:57:12, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is C. Additional imaging, including a computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan.

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent orbital hemorrhages. The first hemorrhage was treated with systemic corticosteroids, which resulted in resolution of the proptosis and visual impairment. However, the patient experienced a second episode of hemorrhage two weeks later, which was also treated with systemic corticosteroids. This time, the visual impairment resolved, but the proptosis did not completely resolve.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a mass lesion in the orbit. The most likely cause of a recurrent orbital hemorrhage is a vascular lesion, such as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). AVMs are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can rupture, causing bleeding.

Additional imaging, including a computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, is the best way to evaluate a patient with a suspected orbital mass lesion. CT scans are very good at identifying the presence of a mass lesion, and PET scans can help to determine the nature of the lesion. In this case, a CT scan showed a mass lesion in the right orbit, and a PET scan showed that the lesion was metabolically active, consistent with a vascular lesion.

Based on the patient's history and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an AVM. Treatment for AVMs can include surgery, embolization, or radiation therapy. The specific treatment approach will depend on the size, location, and type of AVM.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Clinical follow-up for idiopathic recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage is not the best approach in this case because the patient has a history of recurrent hemorrhages and a mass lesion has been identified on imaging.
* B. Transconjunctival orbital biopsy is not the best approach in this case because it is a minimally invasive procedure that is not likely to provide a definitive diagnosis.
* D. Arteriography to look for orbital vascular malformations is not the best approach in this case because the patient has already had a CT scan and PET scan, which are more accurate imaging modalities for evaluating orbital lesions.

  7%|▋         | 113/1525 [28:17<6:07:11, 15.60s/it]The correct answer is C. Consider treating the left eye with intra-arterial melphalan.

The patient has a 5-year history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis. She is currently taking 60 mg of oral prednisone; topical prednisolone acetate, 1%; and oral ibuprofen for 10 days without relief. She is suspected of being a steroid responder due to elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally. Three years prior, sinus pressure symptoms led to magnetic resonance imaging that revealed a nasal sinus mass. Biopsy demonstrated a histiocytic infiltrate with emperipolesis, consistent with Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease. Timolol-dorzolamide topical drops were initiated. Staging evaluations showed no other sites of RDD disease.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with treatment-refractory nodular scleritis. Intra-arterial melphalan is a treatment option for patients with treatment-refractory nodular scleritis. It is a chemotherapy agent that is delivered directly into the artery that supplies blood to the affected eye. Intra-arterial melphalan has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and pain in patients with treatment-refractory nodular scleritis.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient. Switching oral ibuprofen to oral flurbiprofen would not be expected to improve the patient's condition. Initiate an alternative systemic therapy (ie, an immunomodulatory agent) would be a reasonable option, but intra-arterial melphalan is a more aggressive treatment that may be more effective. Administer subtenon triamcinolone to the left eye is a treatment option for patients with nodular scleritis, but it is not expected to be effective in patients with treatment-refractory disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Consider treating the left eye with intra-arterial melphalan.

  7%|▋         | 114/1525 [28:27<5:26:49, 13.90s/it]The correct answer is B: Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass.

The patient has a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow with orbital extension. The patient is strongly against an orbital exenteration, which is a surgical procedure that involves removing the entire contents of the orbit, including the eye.

Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody) is a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. It is given before surgery to shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove. Globe sparing orbitotomy is a surgical procedure that removes the tumor from the orbit while preserving the eye. Surgical excision of the mass is the removal of the tumor by surgery.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Partial debulking of the temple mass followed by cetuximab treatment is not a standard treatment for this type of cancer. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is used to treat metastatic SCC that is EGFR-positive. The patient's tumor is not EGFR-positive, so cetuximab would not be effective.
* Palliative radiotherapy is a treatment that is used to relieve symptoms, such as pain, but it does not cure the cancer. This patient's cancer is not at a stage where palliative radiotherapy would be beneficial.
* Platinum-based chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs that contain platinum to kill cancer cells. It is a standard treatment for SCC that has spread to the lymph nodes. However, this patient's cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes, so platinum-based chemotherapy would not be effective.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass.

  8%|▊         | 115/1525 [28:38<5:03:51, 12.93s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane.

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma in the right arm. She has no further local or metastatic evidence of the tumor. She is currently receiving treatment with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

The patient presents with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye. Examination shows a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye reveals scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV. Optical coherence tomography imaging reveals a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented epiretinal membrane includes epiretinal fibrosis, idiopathic preretinal macular fibrosis, and tractional retinal detachment. Epiretinal fibrosis is the most common cause of a pigmented epiretinal membrane. It is typically seen in older adults and is associated with vitreoretinal degeneration. Idiopathic preretinal macular fibrosis is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of a pigmented epiretinal membrane in the absence of any underlying ocular pathology. Tractional retinal detachment is a more serious condition that is caused by the traction of an epiretinal membrane on the retina.

The treatment for a pigmented epiretinal membrane depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the symptoms. In the case of epiretinal fibrosis, treatment is usually not necessary unless the patient is experiencing significant visual impairment. In some cases, laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy may be used to shrink the epiretinal membrane. In more severe cases, pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane may be necessary.

In the case of the patient described above, the best course of treatment is to perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane. This procedure will remove the epiretinal membrane and allow the retina to reattach. It is a safe and effective procedure that has been shown to improve visual acuity in the majority of patients.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Recommend intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for exudative age-related macular degeneration is incorrect because the patient does not have exudative age-related macular degeneration. The patient has a pigmented epiretinal membrane, which is a different condition.
* Option B: Provide reassurance and recommend close observation is incorrect because the patient is experiencing significant visual impairment. The patient should be treated to improve her vision.
* Option D: Prescribe topical and systemic steroids is incorrect because steroids are not effective in treating a pigmented epiretinal membrane.

  8%|▊         | 116/1525 [28:49<4:54:35, 12.54s/it]The correct answer is B. Immunotherapy-related gastritis.

A. Portal hypertensive gastropathy is a condition that occurs in patients with portal hypertension, a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein is increased. This can lead to the development of esophageal varices, which are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can rupture and bleed. Portal hypertensive gastropathy can also cause gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. However, in this case, the patient does not have portal hypertension, so portal hypertensive gastropathy is not the correct diagnosis.

C. Infectious gastritis can be caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The most common cause of infectious gastritis is Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a bacteria that can infect the stomach lining. H. pylori infection can lead to gastritis, peptic ulcers, and stomach cancer. However, in this case, the patient has been treated with nivolumab, a type of immunotherapy drug that is used to treat cancer. Nivolumab can cause a number of side effects, including gastritis. Therefore, infectious gastritis is not the correct diagnosis.

D. Liver cancer progression is a possibility, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient has been treated with nivolumab, which has resulted in a complete response to her cancer. This means that her cancer is currently in remission. However, it is possible that her cancer could progress despite treatment. If her cancer does progress, it is likely to cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. These symptoms are not present in this case, so liver cancer progression is not the most likely diagnosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Immunotherapy-related gastritis. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings.

  8%|▊         | 117/1525 [29:06<5:22:11, 13.73s/it]The correct answer is C. Tophaceous gout.

Tophaceous gout is a form of gout in which urate crystals form deposits (tophi) in the soft tissues, including the middle ear. The patient in this case presented with left-sided hearing loss, which is a common symptom of tophaceous gout. Otoscopy revealed a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. This is consistent with the appearance of tophi. Pure-tone audiometry results showed a left-sided mixed hearing loss with a pure tone average of 110 dB HL and bone conduction levels at approximately 60 dB HL. This suggests that the hearing loss is due to both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss is often seen in tophaceous gout due to the formation of tophi in the middle ear, which can block the sound waves from reaching the inner ear. Sensorineural hearing loss can also be seen in tophaceous gout due to the inflammation of the inner ear caused by the urate crystals.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cholesteatoma is a growth of abnormal skin cells in the middle ear. It is not associated with hearing loss.
* Osteoma is a benign tumor of bone. It is not associated with hearing loss.
* Tympanosclerosis is a condition in which the middle ear is scarred. It is not associated with hearing loss.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Tophaceous gout. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies.

A thymic cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that arises from the thymus gland. It is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging. However, it can sometimes cause symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and cough. Thymic cysts are typically treated by surgical excision.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common type of tumor in infants and children. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common on the head and neck. Most hemangiomas resolve spontaneously without treatment, but some may require treatment to reduce symptoms or prevent complications.

A lymphatic malformation is a congenital anomaly of the lymphatic system. It is a collection of abnormal lymphatic vessels that can occur anywhere in the body. Lymphatic malformations can be simple (cystic) or complex (mixed). Simple lymphatic malformations are usually asymptomatic and require no treatment. Complex lymphatic malformations can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and infection. Treatment for lymphatic malformations depends on the type and severity of the malformation.

The patient in this case presents with a cystic mass in the neck that is causing stridor and dysphagia. The history and physical examination are consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. Foregut duplication cysts are congenital anomalies that arise from the embryonic foregut. They can occur anywhere along the foregut, from the mouth to the anus. The most common site is the esophagus. Foregut duplication cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging. However, they can sometimes cause symptoms such as stridor, dysphagia, and abdominal pain. Treatment for foregut duplication cysts is surgical excision.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. A thymic cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that arises from the thymus gland.

A pilomatricoma is a benign tumor of the hair follicle. It is typically found in the skin of the head and neck, and is more common in women than men. Pilomatricomas are usually small, painless, and slow-growing. They may be removed surgically if they are cosmetically disfiguring or if they become infected.

An epidermoid cyst is a type of cyst that is formed from the keratinizing cells of the skin. It is usually found on the face, scalp, or neck, and is more common in women than men. Epidermoid cysts are usually small, painless, and slow-growing. They may be removed surgically if they are cosmetically disfiguring or if they become infected.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common type of tumor in infants and children. Hemangiomas can be found anywhere on the body, but are most common on the head and neck. They are usually small and fade away on their own within a few years. However, some hemangiomas can grow larger and require treatment.

The patient in the case presented with a right-side postauricular mass that had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images. In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris. There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of type 1 first branchial cleft cyst. Type 1 first branchial cleft cysts are the most common type of branchial cleft cyst, accounting for approximately 80% of cases. They are typically found in the preauricular area, and are more common in women than men. Type 1 first branchial cleft cysts are thought to arise from the remnants of the first branchial cleft, which is a developmental structure that forms during embryogenesis. The cyst is lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, and may contain hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Type 1 first branchial cleft cysts are usually benign, but they can become infected or cause cosmetic problems. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic findings of the patient in the case. Pilomatricomas are typically found on the face, scalp, or neck, and are more common in women than men. Epidermoid cysts are also typically found on the face, scalp, or neck, and are more common in women than men. Hemangiomas are the most common type of tumor in infants and children, and are usually found on the head and neck.

  8%|▊         | 120/1525 [29:54<6:00:03, 15.38s/it]The correct answer is B. Laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Laryngeal sarcoidosis is a rare condition that occurs when cells called granulomas form in the larynx. Granulomas are small collections of immune cells that can form in response to a variety of triggers, including infection, inflammation, and autoimmune disorders.

The symptoms of laryngeal sarcoidosis can vary depending on the location and extent of the granulomas. In some cases, the condition may be asymptomatic. However, other people may experience symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and pain in the throat.

The diagnosis of laryngeal sarcoidosis is made based on a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Laryngeal biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for laryngeal sarcoidosis, but the condition can often be managed with treatment. Treatment typically involves a combination of corticosteroids and other medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the granulomas.

The prognosis for laryngeal sarcoidosis is generally good. With treatment, most people experience improvement in their symptoms. However, the condition can recur in some cases.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms as well as laryngeal sarcoidosis does.

A. Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a condition that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, and regurgitation. However, laryngopharyngeal reflux does not typically cause hoarseness or difficulty swallowing.

C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. This condition can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, granulomatosis with polyangiitis does not typically cause hoarseness or difficulty swallowing.

D. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare infection of the larynx caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This condition can cause symptoms such as hoarseness, fever, and night sweats. However, laryngeal tuberculosis is much less common than laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Pemphigoid nodularis is a rare autoimmune skin disease characterized by the formation of painful, pruritic nodules on the skin. The nodules are typically 1-2 cm in diameter and are often located on the extremities, trunk, and face. The condition is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction against the basement membrane zone, which is the area between the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) and the dermis (the layer of skin below the epidermis).

Prurigo nodularis is a chronic skin condition characterized by the formation of pruritic (itchy) papules and nodules. The papules and nodules are typically found on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, but they can also be found on the trunk and face. The condition is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including scratching, inflammation, and nerve damage.

Acquired perforating dermatosis is a rare skin disorder characterized by the formation of small, punched-out lesions on the skin. The lesions are typically found on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The condition is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to the skin.

Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa is a rare skin condition characterized by the formation of blisters and erosions on the skin. The blisters and erosions are typically found on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The condition is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to the skin.

The patient in the case presented with a history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on his extremities and trunk. The lesions had been present for 8 months and had not responded to treatment with topical steroids and oral antihistamines. The physical examination revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities. A biopsy specimen taken from one of the skin lesions showed marked hyperkeratosis, acanthosis with irregular elongation of the rete ridges, fibrotic dermis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence revealed linear deposition of immunoglobulin G along the basement membrane zone.

The clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and direct immunofluorescence findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigoid nodularis. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

The patient in the case presented with multiple cutaneous red papules that were first noticed at birth. During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma. Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that is typically present at birth or in the first few months of life. It is characterized by multiple, small, red papules or nodules that may be ulcerated or bleeding. The lesions are most commonly found on the head and neck, but they can also occur on the trunk, extremities, and mucous membranes.

The diagnosis of congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is made based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen is usually confirmatory. Treatment is typically with surgical excision or laser ablation. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the patient's presentation.

* Multifocal infantile hemangioma is a common benign vascular tumor that is typically present at birth. It is characterized by a single or multiple, soft, red papules or nodules that may enlarge over time. The lesions are most commonly found on the head and neck, but they can also occur on the trunk, extremities, and mucous membranes.
* Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare, acquired infection caused by Bartonella henselae. It is characterized by multiple, small, red papules or nodules that may be ulcerated or bleeding. The lesions are most commonly found on the skin, but they can also occur on the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow.
* Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia is a rare, aggressive, malignant vascular tumor that is typically present in children. It is characterized by multiple, small, red papules or nodules that may be ulcerated or bleeding. The lesions are most commonly found on the skin, but they can also occur on the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles, causing them to become weak and fatigued. It is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness, which can affect any muscle in the body, including the muscles that control eye movement. However, in myasthenia gravis, the ptosis and diplopia are usually bilateral, meaning they affect both eyes. In this case, the patient only has symptoms in one eye.

Holmes Adie pupil is a condition that causes a pupil to be larger than the other pupil and to react poorly to light. It is usually caused by damage to the oculomotor nerve, but it can also be caused by other conditions, such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis. In this case, the patient's pupil is not reactive to light, but it is not larger than the other pupil.

A posterior communicating artery aneurysm is a bulge in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. It can cause symptoms such as headache, vision problems, and weakness on one side of the body. However, it does not usually cause ptosis or diplopia. In this case, the patient does not have any of the other symptoms that would suggest a posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve is a condition that occurs when the oculomotor nerve is compressed by a blood vessel. This can cause ptosis, diplopia, and other eye movement problems. It is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient has ptosis, diplopia, and impaired left eye supraduction. The CT angiography and MRI of the brain were normal, which makes it unlikely that the patient has a posterior communicating artery aneurysm or another mass lesion. The patient's laboratory tests were also normal, which makes it unlikely that the patient has a systemic condition such as myasthenia gravis.

The patient is presenting with a dome-shaped eyelid nodule, which is a characteristic finding of molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral skin infection that is spread through close contact with an infected person or object. It is most common in children, but can occur in adults as well. The infection usually goes away on its own within a few months, but can sometimes last for several years.

There is no specific treatment for molluscum contagiosum, but the lesions can be removed by a doctor. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe a topical cream or ointment to help the lesions heal.

It is important to isolate the patient and notify public health authorities if you suspect that they have molluscum contagiosum. This is because the infection can be spread to others through close contact. Public health authorities can help to identify and treat other people who may have been exposed to the infection.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice B, Administer imiquimod, is incorrect because imiquimod is a topical cream that is used to treat genital warts. It is not effective against molluscum contagiosum.
* Choice C, Perform lesion excision by unroofing and curettage, is incorrect because this procedure is not necessary for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. The lesions will usually go away on their own within a few months.
* Choice D, Administer oral acyclovir, is incorrect because acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It is not effective against molluscum contagiosum.

  8%|▊         | 125/1525 [31:13<5:54:05, 15.18s/it]The correct answer is C: Request genetic testing and monitor.

The patient is an 11-year-old boy with a white retinal lesion with calcification in the left eye. The lesion is small, non-vascularized, and does not appear to be causing any visual impairment. The patient has no other symptoms or findings on examination.

The most likely diagnosis is a retinal astrocytoma, which is a benign tumor of the retinal pigment epithelium. Retinal astrocytomas are typically seen in children and young adults, and they are often associated with other genetic syndromes, such as tuberous sclerosis complex.

The initial management of retinal astrocytomas is typically observation. In most cases, the tumors do not grow or cause any problems. However, if the tumor grows or starts to cause visual problems, then treatment may be necessary. Treatment options include surgery, laser therapy, and chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient is young and has no other symptoms or findings on examination. The lesion is small, non-vascularized, and does not appear to be causing any visual impairment. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to observe the lesion and monitor the patient for any changes. If the lesion grows or starts to cause visual problems, then treatment can be considered.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Order orbital magnetic resonance imaging. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary in this case. The lesion is small and located in the retina, which is easily visualized with ophthalmoscopy. MRI would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient.
* B: Biopsy the lesion. Biopsy of the lesion is not necessary in this case. The lesion is small and non-vascularized, and it does not appear to be causing any visual impairment. Biopsy would carry the risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, and it is not likely to change the management of the patient.
* D: Rule out infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are not likely to cause a white retinal lesion with calcification. The patient has no other symptoms or findings on examination that suggest an infectious disease. Therefore, it is not necessary to rule out infectious diseases in this case.

  8%|▊         | 126/1525 [31:29<6:01:45, 15.51s/it]The correct answer is B. Genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a number of genetic disorders that can affect the retinal pigment epithelium, including Stargardt disease, Best disease, and cone-rod dystrophy. These disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, in order to develop the disease.

Genetic testing can be performed to identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the patient's condition. This information can be helpful in making a diagnosis, as well as in planning for treatment and monitoring the patient's progress.

B-scan ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the structure of the eye. However, it is not able to provide information about the function of the retina. Therefore, it would not be helpful in making a diagnosis of a genetic disorder that affects the retinal pigment epithelium.

Observation is not an appropriate management strategy for a patient with a known genetic disorder that affects the retinal pigment epithelium. These disorders are progressive, and early diagnosis and treatment can help to slow the progression of vision loss.

Fundus autofluorescence is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the health of the retinal pigment epithelium. However, it is not able to provide information about the underlying cause of any abnormalities that are seen. Therefore, it would not be helpful in making a diagnosis of a genetic disorder that affects the retinal pigment epithelium.
It is reasoning
  8%|▊         | 127/1525 [31:39<5:25:27, 13.97s/it]The correct answer is C: Observation. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of post-infectious vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a condition that can occur following endophthalmitis. PVR is characterized by the formation of fibrovascular membranes on the surface of the retina, which can lead to retinal detachment.

The patient in this case has already been treated for endophthalmitis with intravitreal antibiotics and steroids. There is no evidence of active infection, and the patient's visual acuity has improved. Repeating intravitreal antibiotics is not necessary at this time, as it is unlikely to be effective in treating PVR. Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with severe PVR who are at risk of retinal detachment. In this case, the patient's PVR is mild and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, pars plana vitrectomy is not necessary. Intravitreal antifungals are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of fungal infection.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Observation. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of progression of PVR, but no further treatment is necessary at this time.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* **A. Repeat intravitreal antibiotics**

Repeating intravitreal antibiotics is not necessary in this case, as the patient has already been treated for endophthalmitis with intravitreal antibiotics and steroids. There is no evidence of active infection, and the patient's visual acuity has improved. Repeating intravitreal antibiotics could potentially cause harm, such as retinal toxicity.

* **B. Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy**

Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with severe PVR who are at risk of retinal detachment. In this case, the patient's PVR is mild and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, pars plana vitrectomy is not necessary.

* **C. Observation**

The patient should be monitored closely for signs of progression of PVR, but no further treatment is necessary at this time. If the patient's PVR progresses, then further treatment may be necessary, such as pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy.

* **D. Intravitreal antifungals**

Intravitreal antifungals are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of fungal infection.

The patient has a pruritic eyelid lesion followed by conjunctival swelling. The lesion resolved after 1 month, but she developed redness and swelling of the inner part of her right conjunctiva the next day. She denied any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or diarrhea. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation, where she had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats. She had not traveled to any other countries.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of conjunctival larva migrans. Conjunctival larva migrans is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the dog hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum. The larvae are typically transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated soil or sand. The larvae can penetrate the skin and migrate through the body, eventually reaching the eye. In the eye, the larvae can cause inflammation and irritation of the conjunctiva.

The treatment of conjunctival larva migrans is surgical removal of the larvae. This can be done with a needle or a surgical instrument. The area around the lesion may be numbed with local anesthesia. After the larvae are removed, the eye may be treated with topical antibiotics to prevent infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cryotherapy of the conjunctival lesion and adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa-2b is not a recommended treatment for conjunctival larva migrans. Cryotherapy is a procedure that uses cold to destroy tissue. It is not effective against the larvae of Ancylostoma caninum. Interferon alfa-2b is a medication that is used to treat certain viral infections. It is not effective against the larvae of Ancylostoma caninum.
* Biopsy of the conjunctival lesion including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry is not a recommended treatment for conjunctival larva migrans. Biopsy is a procedure that involves removing a piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. Flow cytometry is a technique that is used to measure the amount of certain proteins in a cell. Biopsy and flow cytometry are not necessary to diagnose conjunctival larva migrans. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history and physical examination.
* Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical corticosteroids are not recommended treatments for conjunctival larva migrans. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Topical corticosteroids are medications that are used to reduce inflammation. NSAIDs and topical corticosteroids are not effective against the larvae of Ancylostoma caninum.

Myopericytoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor that can occur in any location in the body, but is most commonly found in the extremities. It is usually a small, well-circumscribed mass that is slow-growing and asymptomatic. Myopericytomas are often misdiagnosed as other types of tumors, such as lipoma or fibroma. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and immunostaining. Myopericytomas are usually benign, but can rarely be malignant. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignant mesenchymal tumor that can occur in any location in the body, but is most commonly found in the extremities. It is usually a large, aggressive tumor that is fast-growing and painful. Synovial sarcomas are often misdiagnosed as other types of tumors, such as lipoma or fibrosarcoma. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and immunostaining. Synovial sarcomas are usually malignant and require aggressive treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Neurofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from the nerve sheath. It is usually a small, well-circumscribed mass that is slow-growing and asymptomatic. Neurofibromas are often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple neurofibromas. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and immunostaining. Neurofibromas are usually benign, but can rarely be malignant. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare mesenchymal tumor that can occur in any location in the body, but is most commonly found in the pleura (the lining of the lungs) and the abdomen. It is usually a large, well-circumscribed mass that is slow-growing and asymptomatic. SFTs are often misdiagnosed as other types of tumors, such as lipoma or fibroma. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and immunostaining. SFTs are usually benign, but can rarely be malignant. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

In the case presented, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in her left cheek. She denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space. The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.

The differential diagnosis for a solitary, well-circumscribed mass in the parotid gland includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. The most common benign tumors include pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin tumor, and acinic cell tumor. The most common malignant tumors include adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

In this case, the patient's age, the location of the mass, and the imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of SFT. The biopsy findings are also consistent with SFT, as the spindle cells are negative for CK8/18, S100, and SOX10, and positive for STAT6.

Myopericytoma, synovial sarcoma, and neurofibroma are all rare tumors that can occur in the parotid gland. However, they are less likely than SFT in an 81-year-old woman with a slow-growing, well-circumscribed mass. Additionally, the biopsy findings are not consistent with these tumors.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is SFT.

A facial nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that myelinate the facial nerve. It is the most common type of tumor in the internal auditory canal (IAC). Facial nerve schwannomas typically present with unilateral facial paralysis, hearing loss, and tinnitus. On imaging, facial nerve schwannomas are typically hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and isointense on T1-weighted MRI. They enhance with gadolinium.

A vestibular nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that myelinate the vestibular nerve. It is the second most common type of tumor in the IAC. Vestibular nerve schwannomas typically present with unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. On imaging, vestibular nerve schwannomas are typically hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and isointense on T1-weighted MRI. They enhance with gadolinium.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common type of tumor in the head and neck. Hemangiomas typically present in infancy or early childhood. They can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life (acquired). Hemangiomas can occur anywhere in the head and neck, but they are most common on the face and scalp. On imaging, hemangiomas are typically hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI and hypointense on T1-weighted MRI. They do not enhance with gadolinium.

In the case presented, the patient has a congenital left hemifacial weakness and a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss that evolved since birth. On physical examination, the patient presented a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis. Findings from the rest of the clinical examination were within normal limits. Results of cerebral MRI and temporal bone CT revealed a left internal auditory canal mass, measuring 13×12 mm, developed at the expense of nerve VII, with a dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve with extension to its distal branches. It presented a hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and was strongly enhanced after the injection of gadolinium. This mass was responsible for the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and was in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of neuromuscular choristoma. Neuromuscular choristomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the heterotopic tissue of the facial nerve. They are typically found in the IAC and present with unilateral facial paralysis, hearing loss, and tinnitus. On imaging, neuromuscular choristomas are typically hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and isointense on T1-weighted MRI. They enhance with gadolinium.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history and physical examination. A facial nerve schwannoma would not present with a congenital left hemifacial weakness. A vestibular nerve schwannoma would not present with a chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss. A hemangioma would not present with a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis.

  9%|▊         | 131/1525 [32:40<5:53:38, 15.22s/it]The correct answer is A. Pyoderma gangrenosum.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, and debilitating skin disease characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers that can occur anywhere on the body. It is often associated with underlying systemic disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, myelodysplastic syndromes, and monoclonal gammopathies.

The patient in the case presented with a tender, draining lesion of the central face that rapidly progressed despite several courses of treatment with antibiotics. The lesion was violaceous in color, which is a characteristic finding of pyoderma gangrenosum. Additionally, the patient had a history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, which is a known risk factor for pyoderma gangrenosum.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lupus vulgaris is a chronic skin disease characterized by atrophic, scaly, and infiltrated lesions. It is not associated with rapid progression or ulceration.
* Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but these are usually papular or nodular in appearance and do not progress rapidly.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, but these are usually purpuric or nodular in appearance and do not progress rapidly.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in the case is pyoderma gangrenosum. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The patient is a man in his mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair who presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable. The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio.

The differential diagnosis of a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min includes supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia. The ECG findings in this case are consistent with SVT, specifically atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). AVNRT is the most common type of SVT, accounting for up to 70% of cases. It is caused by a reentrant circuit that involves the atrioventricular node and an accessory pathway. Accessory pathways are abnormal electrical connections between the atria and ventricles.

The treatment of AVNRT depends on the patient's symptoms. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, the first-line treatment is usually adenosine. Adenosine is a short-acting medication that blocks the AV node, which interrupts the reentrant circuit and terminates the tachycardia. If adenosine is unsuccessful, other medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used. In some cases, catheter ablation may be necessary to destroy the accessory pathway.

In the case of the patient in the question, the ECG findings are consistent with AVNRT. The patient is hemodynamically stable, so the first-line treatment is adenosine. If adenosine is unsuccessful, other medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used. In some cases, catheter ablation may be necessary to destroy the accessory pathway.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Perform urgent DC shock is incorrect because the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not require immediate cardioversion.
* Answer B: Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone is incorrect because the patient does not have a bradycardia and does not require a pacemaker.
* Answer D: Order an urgent electrophysiologic investigation is incorrect because the patient does not require further testing at this time.

Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is characterized by myotonia, which is a delayed muscle relaxation after voluntary contraction. The patient in this case does not have myotonia.

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes thickening and hardening of the skin and connective tissues. It is characterized by Raynaud phenomenon, which is a narrowing of the blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to cold or emotional stress. The patient in this case does not have Raynaud phenomenon.

Deep morphea (morphea profunda) is a rare autoimmune disease that causes thickening and hardening of the skin and underlying tissues. It is characterized by atrophic plaques on the skin. The patient in this case does not have atrophic plaques on the skin.

Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the fascia, which is the connective tissue that surrounds muscles. It is characterized by eosinophilia, which is an increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood. The patient in this case has eosinophilia, as well as the other characteristic features of eosinophilic fasciitis, including limited mobility of joints, skin thickening, and a "groove sign."

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis.

  9%|▉         | 134/1525 [33:29<6:10:34, 15.98s/it]The correct answer is C. Restart daily oral itraconazole.

The patient has a history of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities due to Candida albicans. She has previously been treated with oral itraconazole, which was effective in resolving her symptoms. However, her symptoms have recurred since discontinuing itraconazole.

The most appropriate next step in management is to restart daily oral itraconazole. This will likely be effective in resolving her symptoms and preventing further recurrence.

Oral cefazolin is an antibiotic that is not effective against Candida albicans. Prescribing it would not be appropriate in this case.

Hydrocortisone cream is a topical corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammation. However, it is not effective against Candida albicans. Prescribing it would not be appropriate in this case.

Oral terbinafine is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida albicans. However, it is not as effective as itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole is more likely to be effective in preventing further recurrence of Candida albicans infection. Therefore, oral terbinafine is not the best choice in this case.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Restart daily oral itraconazole. This is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's recurrent Candida albicans infection.

  9%|▉         | 135/1525 [33:42<5:43:11, 14.81s/it]The correct answer is D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit.

The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer in remission for which she was undergoing tamoxifen therapy, and prior bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis surgery. She presents with right lagophthalmos, which is incomplete closure of the eyelid. She has also noted blurry vision and a sensation of eye dryness.

On examination, the patient is found to have right upper eyelid retraction with substantial static upper eyelid lag on downgaze. She also has 1-mm right lagophthalmos with incomplete blink. Frontalis and orbicularis oculi strength are intact. She is measured to have a 2-mm relative right enophthalmos and no resistance to retropulsion. A review of patient photographs from 2 years prior showed symmetric bilateral eyelid appearance without retraction.

The differential diagnosis for right lagophthalmos includes:

* Myasthenia gravis
* Graves' disease
* Orbital pseudotumor
* Thyroid eye disease
* Tumor of the orbit
* Trauma

In this case, the patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma and breast cancer in remission for which she was undergoing tamoxifen therapy raises the suspicion for orbital pseudotumor. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition of the orbit that can cause a variety of symptoms, including eyelid retraction, proptosis, and diplopia.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor. The MRI will show characteristic findings of orbital inflammation, including thickening of the extraocular muscles and fat.

If the MRI is positive for orbital pseudotumor, the patient may be treated with a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the optic nerve or to remove a tumor.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's right lagophthalmos.

* Serum thyroid laboratory testing would be appropriate if the patient's history or physical examination suggested a diagnosis of Graves' disease. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest Graves' disease.
* Upper eyelid gold weight implantation is a surgical procedure that is used to treat eyelid ptosis. Ptosis is a condition in which the upper eyelid droops. The patient in this case does not have ptosis.
* Systemic steroid and antiviral therapy would be appropriate if the patient's history or physical examination suggested a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest myasthenia gravis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit.

  9%|▉         | 136/1525 [33:55<5:33:19, 14.40s/it]The correct answer is C. Observation with close follow-up. The patient has a history of cutaneous melanoma, but there is no evidence of metastatic disease in the eyes. The pigmented lesion in the right eye is well-demarcated and does not extend into the angle. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) did not show any masses. Therefore, the most appropriate management is observation with close follow-up.

Corneal biopsy is not indicated in this case because the lesion is well-demarcated and does not extend into the angle. Surgical excision is also not indicated because there is no evidence of malignancy. Prednisolone 4 times a day in the right eye is not indicated because the lesion is not inflammatory.

The patient should be seen by an ophthalmologist every 3-6 months for a dilated eye examination and UBM. If the lesion grows or changes in appearance, a corneal biopsy may be necessary.

  9%|▉         | 137/1525 [34:12<5:48:22, 15.06s/it]The correct answer is D. Oral sirolimus.

A repeated trial of oral prednisolone is not a good option because the patient has already been treated with this medication and it was poorly tolerated. Interventional radiology embolization and debulking is not a good option because the patient has already undergone two of these procedures and they did not improve the esotropia. Pulsed dye laser therapy is not a good option because it is not effective for treating large, complex hemangiomas.

Oral sirolimus is a medication that inhibits the growth of blood vessels. It has been shown to be effective in treating hemangiomas that do not respond to other treatments. In a study of 20 patients with hemangiomas that did not respond to other treatments, oral sirolimus was shown to be effective in shrinking the hemangiomas in 80% of patients. Oral sirolimus is also a good option for this patient because it can be taken orally, which is less invasive than other treatments.

Here are some additional details about the other answer choices:

* Repeated trial of oral prednisolone: Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that is used to suppress the immune system. It is sometimes used to treat hemangiomas, but it is not effective in all cases. In this patient, prednisolone was not effective in shrinking the hemangioma and it was poorly tolerated.
* Interventional radiology embolization and debulking: Interventional radiology embolization is a procedure that uses small particles to block blood flow to a hemangioma. Debulking is a surgical procedure that removes part of a hemangioma. Both of these procedures can be effective in treating hemangiomas, but they are not always successful. In this patient, the hemangioma did not respond to two embolization and debulking procedures.
* Pulsed dye laser therapy: Pulsed dye laser therapy is a procedure that uses a laser to destroy hemangiomas. It is a safe and effective treatment for small hemangiomas, but it is not effective for large, complex hemangiomas. In this patient, the hemangioma is too large to be treated with pulsed dye laser therapy.

  9%|▉         | 138/1525 [34:24<5:26:43, 14.13s/it]The correct diagnosis is intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (IVL). This is a rare, aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects adults. It is characterized by the infiltration of large, atypical cells within blood vessels. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, fatigue, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. However, skin lesions can also be the initial presentation, as in this case.

The diagnosis of IVL is made on the basis of a biopsy of the affected tissue. The biopsy typically shows sheets of large, atypical cells within blood vessels. Immunohistochemical staining can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to subtype the lymphoma. IVL is typically treated with chemotherapy, but the prognosis is poor.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Large B-cell lymphoma is a more common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy. Skin lesions are not a common presenting feature.
* Metastatic carcinoma is a diagnosis of exclusion. In this case, there is no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies or in the biopsy.
* Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy and skin lesions. However, the biopsy in this case does not show features of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

  9%|▉         | 139/1525 [34:40<5:40:09, 14.73s/it]The correct diagnosis is C. Lepromatous leprosy. This is because the patient has a number of clinical features that are characteristic of leprosy, including:

* Diffuse cutaneous lesions with peripheral hyperpigmentation
* Confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp
* Saddle-nose deformity
* Thick mucus and synechiae formation in the nasal passages

The histopathological findings of the biopsy, which show poorly formed granulomas and acid-fast bacilli, are also consistent with leprosy.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions. However, the skin lesions in sarcoidosis are typically non-specific and do not have the characteristic features of leprosy. In addition, sarcoidosis does not typically cause saddle-nose deformity or nasal obstruction.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a vasculitis that can affect the skin, lungs, and kidneys. The skin lesions in GPA can be similar to those of leprosy, but they are usually more severe and widespread. In addition, GPA typically does not cause saddle-nose deformity or nasal obstruction.

Progression of mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can cause skin lesions. However, the skin lesions in mycosis fungoides are typically hypopigmented and do not have the characteristic features of leprosy. In addition, mycosis fungoides does not typically cause saddle-nose deformity or nasal obstruction.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Lepromatous leprosy.

  9%|▉         | 140/1525 [34:56<5:51:16, 15.22s/it]The correct diagnosis is coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection caused by the Coccidioides immitis fungus. The fungus is found in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is spread through the air when people breathe in spores from the soil.

The most common symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are fever, cough, headache, and fatigue. The infection can also cause pneumonia, skin lesions, and meningitis. In some cases, coccidioidomycosis can be serious or even life-threatening.

The diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is made based on a person's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The most common laboratory test is a blood test to look for antibodies to the Coccidioides immitis fungus. Other laboratory tests may include a chest X-ray, CT scan, or MRI.

The treatment of coccidioidomycosis depends on the severity of the infection. Mild cases of coccidioidomycosis may not require treatment. However, more severe cases may require treatment with antifungal medications.

The prognosis for coccidioidomycosis is generally good. Most people with coccidioidomycosis recover completely. However, some people may have long-term problems, such as chronic lung disease.

The following are the reasons why coccidioidomycosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case:

* The patient has a history of travel to an area where coccidioidomycosis is common.
* The patient has symptoms that are consistent with coccidioidomycosis, such as fever, cough, headache, and fatigue.
* The patient's laboratory tests are consistent with coccidioidomycosis, such as a positive blood test for antibodies to the Coccidioides immitis fungus.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the larynx. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or a family history of the disease. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
* Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can affect the lungs. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for tuberculosis, such as HIV infection or recent travel to an area where tuberculosis is common. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with tuberculosis.
* Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a viral infection that can cause growths on the vocal cords. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, such as a history of smoking or a family history of the disease. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

The patient's history of progressively worsening hoarseness and dyspnea, as well as the findings on physical examination, videostroboscopy, and CT scan, are all consistent with a diagnosis of blastomycosis.

Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including hoarseness, dyspnea, and airway obstruction. The infection is typically acquired through inhalation of spores from the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is found in soil and decaying organic matter.

The diagnosis of blastomycosis is confirmed by laboratory testing, such as a fungal culture or a serologic test. Treatment typically involves antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B or itraconazole.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect any organ in the body, but it does not typically cause hoarseness or dyspnea.
* Squamous cell cancer is a type of cancer that can develop in the larynx, but it is not typically associated with the findings on physical examination, videostroboscopy, and CT scan that were described in the case.
* Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including hoarseness, but it is not typically associated with the findings on physical examination, videostroboscopy, and CT scan that were described in the case.

Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare, non-neoplastic, inflammatory disorder of histiocytes. It is characterized by the presence of multiple, reddish-brown, subcutaneous nodules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The nodules are usually painless and non-tender. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of a nodule. There is no cure for multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, but treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs can help to control the symptoms.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the formation of multiple, soft, subcutaneous nodules. The nodules are usually painless and non-tender. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of a nodule. There is no cure for juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, but treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs can help to control the symptoms.

Rheumatoid nodules are small, firm, subcutaneous nodules that are associated with rheumatoid arthritis. They are usually located on the extensor surfaces of the hands, wrists, and elbows. The nodules are painless and non-tender. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of a nodule. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but treatment with medications such as methotrexate and adalimumab can help to control the symptoms.

Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma) is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of ceramide in the lysosomes of cells. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid ceramidase. The disease is characterized by the development of multiple, subcutaneous nodules, joint pain, hoarseness, and developmental delay. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of a nodule and measurement of the acid ceramidase activity in the blood. There is no cure for Farber disease, but treatment with bone marrow transplantation can help to improve the symptoms.

The patient in the case presentation has multiple, subcutaneous nodules, joint pain, hoarseness, and developmental delay. These findings are consistent with Farber disease. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain all of the patient's symptoms.

The patient has a history of systemic sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Systemic sclerosis can be complicated by keloidal scleroderma, a rare condition that causes the formation of thick, raised scars on the skin. The lesions of keloidal scleroderma are typically firm, red-brown plaques without overlying scale, and they may be pruritic.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with keloidal scleroderma. The firm, red-brown plaques on his proximal upper extremities and anterior trunk are typical of the condition. The lack of appreciable skin tightening in the affected areas is also consistent with keloidal scleroderma, as this is a condition that affects the skin only, not the underlying tissues.

The patient's laboratory findings are unremarkable, which is also consistent with keloidal scleroderma. There is no evidence of systemic inflammation or infection, which would be expected in other conditions such as sarcoidosis or lobomycosis.

The biopsy specimens show features of keloidal scleroderma. The epidermis is thickened and there is fibrosis of the dermis. There is also an increase in the number of fibroblasts in the dermis. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of keloidal scleroderma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and other organs. The patient's clinical presentation is not consistent with sarcoidosis.
* Lobomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The patient's clinical presentation is not consistent with lobomycosis.

Giant cell arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the medium and large arteries that can affect any part of the body, but is most commonly seen in the temporal arteries. It is a systemic vasculitis, meaning that it can affect multiple organs and systems.

The most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are headache, jaw claudication (pain when chewing), scalp tenderness, and visual disturbances. Other symptoms can include fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are usually elevated in giant cell arteritis. A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not always necessary.

The treatment of giant cell arteritis is with high-dose corticosteroids. This usually results in rapid improvement in symptoms. Corticosteroid therapy is typically continued for 12-24 months, and then tapered gradually.

The prognosis for giant cell arteritis is generally good with treatment. However, if left untreated, the disease can lead to serious complications, such as blindness, stroke, and aortic aneurysm.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis is a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the muscles. It is not associated with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, or visual disturbances.
* Immunoglobulin G4–related disease is a group of autoimmune disorders that are characterized by the production of immunoglobulin G4 antibodies. It can affect multiple organs and systems, but is not typically associated with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, or visual disturbances.
* Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles. It is not typically associated with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, or visual disturbances.

The patient has bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments. This is a rare condition that is often caused by a systemic disease, such as multiple myeloma or amyloidosis. In these conditions, abnormal proteins build up in the blood and can leak into the eye, causing inflammation and damage to the retina.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. She is an elderly woman with a history of cancer, and she has bilateral retinal detachments that have been refractory to treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Her fundus examination shows characteristic findings of multiple myeloma, including macular PEDs, SRF, and an epiretinal membrane.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test. These tests are used to detect the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood. If the tests are positive, the patient will need to be treated for multiple myeloma. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Continue intravitreal anti-VEGF injections) is incorrect because the patient has already received 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) without improvement. In addition, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are not effective for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
* Option B (Start photodynamic therapy) is incorrect because photodynamic therapy is not effective for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
* Option C (Perform an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing) is incorrect because these tests are not necessary to diagnose multiple myeloma.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Obtain serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test.

 10%|▉         | 146/1525 [36:33<6:01:18, 15.72s/it]The correct answer is B. Genetic testing.

The patient has a history of progressive vision loss, poor mentation, and a family history of vision loss. The physical examination and imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of a retinal dystrophy. Genetic testing is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific genetic mutation involved. This information can be used to provide the patient and her family with accurate information about the prognosis and potential treatment options.

Electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. This test can be used to diagnose retinal disorders, but it is not specific for any particular disease. In this case, the patient's ERG is likely to be abnormal, but this information will not be helpful in determining the specific diagnosis or prognosis.

Observation is not a reasonable next step in this case. The patient has already experienced significant vision loss, and there is no evidence that her condition will improve without treatment. Observation would only delay the initiation of treatment, which could potentially worsen her outcome.

Muscle biopsy is not a reasonable next step in this case. The patient's vision loss is not due to a muscle disorder. Muscle biopsy would not provide any useful information in this case.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Genetic testing. This is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis, determine the specific genetic mutation involved, and provide the patient and her family with accurate information about the prognosis and potential treatment options.

Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the salivary glands characterized by infiltration of the salivary ducts with eosinophils. It is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1-0.5%. It is more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is 30-40 years.

The exact cause of eosinophilic sialodochitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in the allergic response. In eosinophilic sialodochitis, eosinophils accumulate in the salivary ducts, causing inflammation and damage to the ducts. This can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and tenderness of the salivary glands.

There is no cure for eosinophilic sialodochitis, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. Treatment usually involves a combination of medications, such as corticosteroids and antihistamines. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected salivary glands.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

B. Sjogren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva. It is characterized by dryness of the eyes (xerophthalmia) and mouth (xerostomia). Sjogren syndrome can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints, skin, and kidneys.

C. Sialolithiasis is a condition in which salivary stones form in the salivary glands. Salivary stones can cause pain, swelling, and infection of the salivary glands.

Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular lesion that typically presents as an erythematous, atrophic plaque on the lower extremities of older adults. The lesion is often associated with pruritus and can slowly enlarge over time. The histopathology of poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma shows a band-like proliferation of small, round vascular channels in the upper dermis. The endothelial cells lining these channels are typically unremarkable.

Acquired elastotic hemangioma is a more common vascular lesion that typically presents as a solitary, reddish-brown papule or nodule on the trunk or extremities. The lesion is often associated with solar elastosis and can slowly enlarge over time. The histopathology of acquired elastotic hemangioma shows a proliferation of thickened, elastotic fibers in the dermis. The endothelial cells lining the vascular channels are typically unremarkable.

Microvenular hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular lesion that typically presents as a small, red papule on the face or extremities. The lesion is often associated with a port-wine stain. The histopathology of microvenular hemangioma shows a proliferation of small, round vascular channels in the papillary dermis. The endothelial cells lining these channels are typically unremarkable.

Acroangiodermatitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition that typically presents as a violaceous plaque on the distal extremities. The lesion is often associated with pain, ulceration, and lymphedema. The histopathology of acroangiodermatitis shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis in the dermis. The endothelial cells lining the vascular channels are typically unremarkable.

In the case presented, the patient is an otherwise healthy man in his early 70s who presents with a 2-year history of a mildly pruritic, erythematous, and gradually enlarging lesion on the proximal portion of his left calf. The lesion had appeared without an identifiable cause, and for the previous 2 months, the patient had applied topical corticosteroids and antifungals with no improvement. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque that was slightly raised but with an atrophic appearance. A skin biopsy was obtained for histopathology examination, which showed a band-like vascular proliferation in the upper dermis with no grenz zone. The endothelial cells lining these channels were typically unremarkable. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma.

 10%|▉         | 150/1525 [37:29<5:45:46, 15.09s/it]The correct answer is C. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

The patient presented with syncope and shaking, which are concerning for a cardiac arrhythmia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a prolonged QT interval, which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. The patient also has a family history of sudden cardiac death, which is another risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias.

A 30-day ambulatory event monitor is a good test to evaluate for arrhythmias, but it would not be able to identify a potential arrhythmia that caused the patient's syncope. An electrophysiology study is a test that can be used to identify and treat arrhythmias, but it is not necessary in this case because the patient already has a prolonged QT interval and a family history of sudden cardiac death. Ventricular ablation is a procedure that can be used to treat arrhythmias, but it is not necessary in this case because the patient already has a prolonged QT interval and a family history of sudden cardiac death.

An ICD is a device that can be implanted in the chest to monitor the heart rhythm and deliver an electric shock if it detects a dangerous arrhythmia. This is the best treatment for the patient because it will prevent sudden cardiac death.

Here are some additional details about the different treatment options:

* A 30-day ambulatory event monitor is a device that is worn by the patient for 30 days. It records the patient's heart rhythm continuously during that time. This test can be used to identify arrhythmias that occur infrequently, such as those that only cause symptoms once in a while.
* An electrophysiology study is a procedure that is performed in the hospital. A catheter is inserted into a vein and guided to the heart. The catheter is used to stimulate the heart and record the heart's electrical activity. This test can be used to identify arrhythmias and to determine if they can be treated with ablation.
* Ventricular ablation is a procedure that is performed in the hospital. A catheter is inserted into a vein and guided to the heart. The catheter is used to destroy the tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. This procedure is only used for patients who have arrhythmias that cannot be treated with medication or an ICD.

 10%|▉         | 151/1525 [37:46<5:54:54, 15.50s/it]The correct answer is A. Check blood lead concentration.

The patient's history of abdominal pain and anemia, as well as the bluish pigmentation along his gingival margin and the small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in his erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear, are all consistent with lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is a common cause of anemia, and the bluish pigmentation is caused by deposition of lead in the tissues. The punctate inclusions are called basophilic stippling, and they are caused by the accumulation of lead in the red blood cells.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level is a test that is used to diagnose autoimmune diseases such as vasculitis. Flow cytometry is a test that is used to identify and quantify different types of cells in the blood. Urine test for porphobilinogen is a test that is used to diagnose porphyria, a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the production of heme.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with lead poisoning. Therefore, the next step in the evaluation should be to check the patient's blood lead concentration. If the blood lead concentration is elevated, the patient should be treated with chelation therapy to remove the lead from his body.

 10%|▉         | 152/1525 [37:57<5:25:26, 14.22s/it]The correct answer is B: Serum vascular endothelial growth factor.

Fluorescein angiography is a procedure that uses a dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It is not typically used in the diagnosis of optic disc edema, as it is not specific for this condition.

A repeated lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case, as the first lumbar puncture showed a normal opening pressure.

Acetazolamide is a medication that is used to reduce intracranial pressure. However, it is not indicated in this case, as the patient's intracranial pressure is normal.

Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein that is involved in the growth and development of blood vessels. It is elevated in a number of conditions, including optic disc edema. In this case, the patient has an elevated serum VEGF level, which is consistent with the diagnosis of optic disc edema.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Serum vascular endothelial growth factor.

 10%|█         | 153/1525 [38:13<5:40:19, 14.88s/it]The correct answer is C. Biopsy the EOMs.

The patient in the case has a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) status in remission after liver transplant. Several days into her hospital course, she developed acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia as well as occasional flushing and palpitations. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. She had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes. Anterior segment examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy results were otherwise unremarkable.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit with contrast revealed bilateral and symmetric tendon-sparing extraocular muscle enlargement of all extraocular muscles (EOMs) with nodular heterogenous enhancement (Figure 1B). She had no history of thyroid disease, and laboratory results, including thyrotropin, T3, T4, thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody, antimicrosomal antibody, IgG4, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, were all within normal limits.

The differential diagnosis for bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement includes thyroid eye disease, orbital pseudotumor, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma. The patient's history and laboratory findings make thyroid eye disease unlikely. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-specific inflammatory disorder of the orbit that can cause bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement. However, orbital pseudotumor typically presents with pain, redness, and swelling of the eyelids, which the patient does not have. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can involve the orbit. However, sarcoidosis typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest x-ray, which the patient does not have. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph nodes that can spread to the orbit. However, lymphoma typically presents with a mass lesion in the orbit, which the patient does not have. Metastatic carcinoma is a cancer that has spread from another part of the body to the orbit. Metastatic carcinoma is the most common cause of bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement in patients with a history of cancer.

The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs. The next step in management is to biopsy the EOMs to confirm the diagnosis and determine the origin of the metastasis. Biopsy of the EOMs is the only way to definitively diagnose metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs. Treatment of metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs depends on the origin of the metastasis. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Start intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative thyroid eye disease is incorrect because the patient's history and laboratory findings make thyroid eye disease unlikely.
* B. Obtain positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging to look for additional metastases and biopsy sites is incorrect because PET-CT imaging is not necessary to diagnose metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs. Biopsy of the EOMs is the only way to definitively diagnose metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs.
* D. Coordinate with primary team for treatment with octreotide is incorrect because octreotide is not a treatment for metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs. Treatment of metastatic carcinoma to the EOMs depends on the origin of the metastasis. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.

 10%|█         | 154/1525 [38:27<5:33:45, 14.61s/it]The correct answer is C. Refer to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment.

The patient has multifocal chorioretinal scars, which are a classic finding in ocular tuberculosis. Ocular tuberculosis is a rare but serious complication of systemic tuberculosis. It can cause a variety of visual symptoms, including blurred vision, floaters, and photopsia. In severe cases, it can lead to blindness.

The diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis is made based on a history of systemic tuberculosis, a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and characteristic findings on ophthalmic examination. Treatment is with a four-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A is incorrect because the patient does not have a self-limited condition. B is incorrect because steroids are not indicated for the treatment of ocular tuberculosis. D is incorrect because magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast and lumbar puncture are not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of ocular tuberculosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Refer to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment.

 10%|█         | 155/1525 [38:44<5:46:45, 15.19s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform YAG capsulotomy. The patient has a pseudophakic eye with a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye. This is most likely due to posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which is a common complication of cataract surgery. PCO occurs when the posterior capsule, which is the membrane that holds the intraocular lens in place, becomes cloudy. This can cause a decrease in vision, glare, and halos.

YAG capsulotomy is a procedure that uses a laser to create a small opening in the posterior capsule. This allows the cloudiness to clear, which improves vision. It is a safe and effective procedure that is usually performed on an outpatient basis.

The other options are incorrect. Pilocarpine is a medication that is used to treat glaucoma. It works by constricting the pupils, which reduces the amount of fluid in the eye. However, pilocarpine would not be effective in treating PCO.

Glaucoma surgery is a procedure that is used to lower intraocular pressure. It is not indicated for PCO.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a procedure that is used to remove vitreous gel from the eye. It is not indicated for PCO.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Perform YAG capsulotomy.

The patient's history of clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease and recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol is significant. The patient's sudden-onset blurry vision in her right eye could be a side effect of the immunotherapy. Therefore, it is important to obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol to determine if it is the cause of the patient's vision loss.

A. Recommend cessation of intravenous corticosteroids is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision could be caused by the immunotherapy, not the corticosteroids.

C. Obtain information on prior radiation therapy is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision could be caused by the immunotherapy, not the radiation therapy.

D. Close observation is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision could be a serious side effect of the immunotherapy. It is important to determine the cause of the patient's vision loss as soon as possible.

 10%|█         | 157/1525 [39:08<5:11:30, 13.66s/it]The correct answer is B. Multicentric Castleman disease.

The patient in the case presented with a number of symptoms and findings that are consistent with Multicentric Castleman disease, including:

* Cervical lymphadenopathy
* Abdominal pain
* Fatigue
* Night sweats
* Decreased appetite
* Weight loss
* Elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
* Extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy
* Fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm

Multicentric Castleman disease is a rare, non-cancerous (benign) disorder that affects the body's lymph nodes. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell. Plasma cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that help the body fight infection. In Multicentric Castleman disease, the plasma cells grow out of control and form tumors in the lymph nodes.

The exact cause of Multicentric Castleman disease is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people with Multicentric Castleman disease have a family history of the disorder, while others may develop it as a result of an infection or other illness.

There is no cure for Multicentric Castleman disease, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life for people with the disorder. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. It is not typically associated with the symptoms and findings that were present in the patient in the case.
* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. It is not typically associated with the symptoms and findings that were present in the patient in the case.
* Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and other organs. It is not typically associated with the symptoms and findings that were present in the patient in the case.

 10%|█         | 158/1525 [39:25<5:32:06, 14.58s/it]The correct diagnosis is primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (PCER). PCER is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of small, round blue cells in the dermis. The histopathologic findings in this case are consistent with PCER, including papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia, edema of dermal papillae, and neoplastic infiltration consisting of small round blue cells with alternating areas of dense and loose cellularity. The tumor cells are positive for MyoD1, a muscle-specific transcription factor that is typically expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma.

Superficial lymphatic malformation is a benign condition that is characterized by the presence of dilated lymphatic channels in the skin. It is typically seen in children and young adults, and it is often associated with other congenital anomalies. The histopathologic findings in this case are not consistent with a superficial lymphatic malformation.

Primary superficial Ewing sarcoma is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of small, round blue cells in the dermis. The histopathologic findings in this case are not consistent with primary superficial Ewing sarcoma.

Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of lymphoblasts in the lymph nodes. It is typically seen in children and young adults. The histopathologic findings in this case are not consistent with lymphoblastic lymphoma.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The histopathologic findings in this case are consistent with PCER, and the tumor cells are positive for MyoD1, a muscle-specific transcription factor that is typically expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma.

 10%|█         | 159/1525 [39:40<5:37:26, 14.82s/it]The correct answer is B. Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers.

The patient in this case has a long-standing history of poorly controlled HIV, which has led to a low CD4 count. This puts him at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a herpesvirus that can cause a variety of symptoms, including oral and perianal ulcers. The patient's presentation is consistent with EBV infection, including the following:

* A history of poorly controlled HIV
* A low CD4 count
* Oral and perianal ulcers
* Biopsy findings of a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, with prominent admixed large and atypical cells
* Epstein-Barr virus–encoded RNA staining showing scattered positivity in some cells

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Chronic ulcerative herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of oral ulcers, but it is not typically associated with perianal ulcers. Additionally, the patient's biopsy findings are not consistent with HSV infection.
* Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause perianal ulcers. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms of Crohn disease, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, or weight loss. Additionally, his biopsy findings are not consistent with Crohn disease.
* Ulcers secondary to fungal infection are typically caused by Candida albicans. However, the patient's biopsy findings are not consistent with fungal infection.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

 10%|█         | 160/1525 [39:57<5:46:24, 15.23s/it]The correct diagnosis is pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is a sudden and often dramatic event that occurs when a pituitary tumor hemorrhages or undergoes infarction. This can lead to rapid enlargement of the tumor, which can compress surrounding structures and cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, visual changes, and cranial nerve palsies.

In this case, the patient's presentation is consistent with pituitary apoplexy. He developed sudden-onset headache, facial numbness, and ophthalmoplegia (inability to move the eyes) after an 8.5-hour robotic cystectomy. He had a known pituitary macroadenoma (a type of pituitary tumor) that was compressing the optic chiasm and pons. On examination, he was found to have complete bilateral ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally, and no pupillary response to light or accommodation. These findings are consistent with compression of the optic chiasm, cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, and the trigeminal nerve.

The MRI findings also support the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy. The pre-symptomatic MRI showed a 4.9 × 4.6 × 5.2-cm sellar/parasellar lobulated mass with homogenous enhancement. The post-symptomatic MRI showed that the mass had enlarged to 5.3 × 5.1 × 5.3 cm and had lost enhancement. This suggests that the mass had hemorrhaged or undergone infarction.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Orbital compartment syndrome is a condition that occurs when the pressure inside the orbit increases, causing compression of the optic nerve and other structures. This can lead to blindness. However, orbital compartment syndrome is not typically associated with pituitary apoplexy. Ocular motor apraxia is a condition that occurs when there is a loss of voluntary control of the eye movements. However, ocular motor apraxia is not typically associated with pituitary apoplexy. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the cavernous sinus, a venous sinus located in the skull. This can lead to compression of the cranial nerves that pass through the cavernous sinus, causing a variety of symptoms, including headache, facial numbness, and ophthalmoplegia. However, cavernous sinus thrombosis is not typically associated with pituitary apoplexy.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis in this case is pituitary apoplexy. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and MRI findings.

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. She presents with sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise. Her last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. She is not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. She reports no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus. Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is acute hepatitis D. This is supported by the patient's history of intravenous drug use, which is a risk factor for hepatitis D infection, and the presence of chronic HBV infection, which increases the risk of developing acute hepatitis D. The patient's symptoms of jaundice and malaise are also consistent with acute hepatitis D.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies. HDV IgM antibodies are present in the blood during acute infection, while HDV IgG antibodies are present for life. If the patient is found to have HDV IgM antibodies, the next step is to test for HDV RNA. HDV RNA is present in the blood during acute infection and can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Check plasma HIV-1 RNA level: This is not necessary in this patient because she has already tested negative for HIV antibody.
* B. Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody: This is not necessary in this patient because she has already tested negative for hepatitis E virus RNA.
* C. Order testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody: This is not necessary in this patient because she does not have any symptoms or signs of autoimmune hepatitis.

 11%|█         | 162/1525 [40:28<5:52:38, 15.52s/it]The correct answer is C. Prescribe prednisone, 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with relapsing polychondritis, a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of cartilage. The most common sites of involvement are the ears, nose, eyes, joints, and respiratory tract. The diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis is made based on clinical presentation and supportive laboratory findings, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). There is no specific treatment for relapsing polychondritis, but corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the mainstay of therapy. Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to cartilage.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) is not the correct next step because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any pulmonary involvement. Chest radiography and PFT may be helpful in ruling out other possible diagnoses, but they are not necessary in this case.
* B. Perform a biopsy of the left ear is not the correct next step because the patient's history and physical examination are not concerning for malignancy. A biopsy may be helpful in establishing a definitive diagnosis, but it is not necessary in this case.
* D. Prescribe ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily is not the correct next step because ibuprofen is not a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for relapsing polychondritis. Ibuprofen may be helpful in relieving pain, but it will not help to prevent further damage to cartilage.

In conclusion, the correct next step is to prescribe prednisone, 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily.

 11%|█         | 163/1525 [40:43<5:46:42, 15.27s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain orbital imaging with intravenous contrast.

The patient in the case presented with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis. The ptosis was more notable at night and with fatigue. She denied experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits.

On examination, corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination was notable for left upper eyelid ptosis, with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative.

The differential diagnosis for left upper eyelid ptosis is broad and includes myasthenia gravis, Horner syndrome, third nerve palsy, levator dehiscence, and blepharoptosis.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fluctuating weakness of skeletal muscles. The weakness is often worse with sustained activity and improves with rest. The most common presenting symptom is ptosis, which is often bilateral. Other symptoms may include diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory weakness.

Horner syndrome is a disorder characterized by unilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. The ptosis is caused by a decrease in sympathetic innervation to the upper eyelid. Horner syndrome can be caused by a variety of conditions, including tumors, trauma, and vascular disorders.

Third nerve palsy is a disorder characterized by paralysis of the third cranial nerve. The third cranial nerve controls the movement of the eye, including upgaze, downgaze, adduction, and intorsion. Third nerve palsy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including tumors, trauma, and vascular disorders.

Levator dehiscence is a condition in which the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is responsible for elevating the upper eyelid, becomes detached from the tarsus, which is the connective tissue that makes up the upper eyelid. Levator dehiscence can cause ptosis, which is often unilateral.

Blepharoptosis is a general term for ptosis that is not caused by a specific underlying disorder. Blepharoptosis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including aging, trauma, and surgery.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain orbital imaging with intravenous contrast. Orbital imaging will help to identify the underlying cause of the ptosis. If the imaging reveals a mass, such as a tumor, then further testing may be necessary, such as biopsy. If the imaging does not reveal a mass, then other causes of ptosis, such as myasthenia gravis, may be considered.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, perform left upper eyelid ptosis repair, is incorrect because the underlying cause of the ptosis has not been identified. It is premature to perform surgery without knowing the cause of the ptosis.
* Option B, request single-fiber electromyography, is incorrect because single-fiber electromyography is not a sensitive or specific test for myasthenia gravis. A more sensitive and specific test, such as a Tensilon test, should be performed first.
* Option C, biopsy the left levator palpebrae superioris, is incorrect because the underlying cause of the ptosis has not been identified. It is premature to biopsy the levator palpebrae superioris without knowing the cause of the ptosis.

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a 3-week history of sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. She denied any other neurologic symptoms. Her medical history included untreated hyperprolactinemia manifested by galactorrhea and oligomenorrhea. She did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol.

On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia, which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a variety of conditions that can cause sudden-onset headache and binocular vertical diplopia. These include:

* Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)
* Pituitary apoplexy
* Orbital pseudotumor
* Carotid artery dissection
* Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
* Brain tumor

The most important next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the brain. This will help to rule out any life-threatening conditions, such as a brain tumor or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. If the CT scan and CTA are normal, the next step would be to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The MRI can help to identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate in this case.

* A. Check thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels and order orbital imaging is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with thyroid disease. Orbital imaging may be helpful in the evaluation of orbital pseudotumor, but it is not necessary in this case.
* B. Order acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with myasthenia gravis. Acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers are only necessary in patients with suspected myasthenia gravis.
* D. Perform urgent lumbar puncture is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with meningitis. Lumbar puncture is only necessary in patients with suspected meningitis.

A is incorrect because intraocular lens suture fixation or exchange is a surgical procedure that is not indicated in this case. The patient has a subluxed intraocular lens (IOL), but there is no evidence of infection or inflammation. Surgery would be a risky procedure with a high risk of complications, and there is no guarantee that it would be successful in restoring the patient's vision.

C is incorrect because anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to assess the structure of the anterior segment of the eye. However, OCT is not able to provide information about the movement of the IOL or the presence of vitreous prolapse.

D is incorrect because a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion is not indicated in this case. The lesion is small and does not appear to be causing any problems. A biopsy would be a risky procedure with a high risk of complications, and there is no guarantee that it would provide any useful information.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to assess the structure of the anterior segment of the eye. UBM is able to provide information about the movement of the IOL, the presence of vitreous prolapse, and the condition of the ocular surface. In this case, UBM would be the most appropriate test to order in order to further evaluate the patient's condition.

The patient has bilateral corneal ulcers, which are a common finding in patients with vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of normal epithelial tissues, including the cornea. In the absence of vitamin A, the corneal epithelium becomes dry and fragile, and is more susceptible to infection and ulceration.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's corneal ulcers. Option A, Perform allergy testing and initiate topical steroids, is incorrect because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with an allergic etiology for his corneal ulcers. Option C, Obtain corneal herpes simplex viral cultures, is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has herpes simplex keratitis. Option D, Perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye, is incorrect because the patient's corneal ulcers are not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B: Check serum vitamin A levels. This is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's bilateral corneal ulcers.

 11%|█         | 167/1525 [41:48<6:01:59, 15.99s/it]The correct answer is B. Pneumolabyrinth.

Pneumolabyrinth is a condition in which air enters the inner ear. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. The most common cause of pneumolabyrinth is head trauma. Other causes include barotrauma (a change in pressure in the middle ear), surgery, and tumors.

The diagnosis of pneumolabyrinth is based on a history of head trauma or other risk factors, as well as the physical examination and imaging studies. The physical examination may reveal nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), hearing loss, and tinnitus. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can show air in the inner ear.

The treatment of pneumolabyrinth is usually conservative. This includes bed rest, vestibular rehabilitation, and medications to relieve symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the air from the inner ear.

The prognosis for pneumolabyrinth is generally good. Most people recover completely within a few weeks. However, some people may have permanent hearing loss or tinnitus.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome is a condition in which the superior semicircular canal is abnormally thin. This can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, the patient in the case did not have a history of head trauma or other risk factors for superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.
* Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear. This can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, the patient in the case did not have a history of recent upper respiratory infection or other risk factors for labyrinthitis.
* Meniere disease is a condition that affects the inner ear. This can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, the patient in the case did not have a history of fluctuating hearing loss or other risk factors for Meniere disease.

 11%|█         | 168/1525 [42:03<5:53:44, 15.64s/it]The correct answer is B. Parathyroid cyst.

A parathyroid cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on one of the four parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are small, pea-sized glands that are located in the neck, near the thyroid gland. They produce a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps to regulate the level of calcium in the blood.

Parathyroid cysts are usually benign (noncancerous) and do not cause any symptoms. However, they can sometimes grow large enough to press on nearby structures, such as the thyroid gland or the trachea (windpipe). This can cause symptoms such as neck pain, difficulty swallowing, or hoarseness.

Parathyroid cysts are often diagnosed when a doctor feels a lump in the neck during a physical examination. Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or CT scan, can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

Most parathyroid cysts go away on their own without treatment. However, if a cyst is causing symptoms, it may need to be surgically removed.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Benign thyroid nodule: A benign thyroid nodule is a small, noncancerous growth on the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules are common, and most are not harmful. However, some thyroid nodules can produce excess thyroid hormone, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and hair loss. Thyroid nodules can also be cancerous.

C. Reactive viral lymphadenopathy: Reactive viral lymphadenopathy is a condition in which the lymph nodes in the neck become enlarged due to a viral infection. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that filter the lymph fluid. Lymph fluid is a clear fluid that carries white blood cells and other immune cells throughout the body. Viral infections can cause the lymph nodes to become enlarged, tender, and warm to the touch.

D. Thyroglossal duct cyst: A thyroglossal duct cyst is a small, fluid-filled sac that develops along the path of the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct is a tube that forms in the embryo and helps to connect the thyroid gland to the base of the tongue. The thyroglossal duct usually disappears during fetal development, but in some cases, it can remain and form a cyst. Thyroglossal duct cysts are usually benign (noncancerous) and do not cause any symptoms. However, they can sometimes grow large enough to press on nearby structures, such as the thyroid gland or the trachea (windpipe). This can cause symptoms such as neck pain, difficulty swallowing, or hoarseness.

 11%|█         | 169/1525 [42:19<5:59:46, 15.92s/it]The correct answer is C. Parotid gland hemorrhage.

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction that is treated with warfarin. She denied any personal or family history of cancer. She was previously briefly a smoker.

On physical examination, there is no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. Her cranial nerves are intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa is intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces.

The patient's history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction is consistent with the use of warfarin, which is a blood thinner. Warfarin can increase the risk of bleeding, including bleeding into the parotid gland. The patient's INR was 4.4, which is above the therapeutic range for warfarin. This suggests that the patient is at increased risk for bleeding.

The patient's physical examination is also consistent with a parotid gland hemorrhage. There is no erythema or tenderness of the parotid, which is typically seen with infection or inflammation. The patient's cranial nerves are intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. This suggests that the hemorrhage is not causing compression of the facial nerve. The oral mucosa is intact with no epithelial lesions. This suggests that the hemorrhage is not caused by an underlying malignancy.

The CT scan findings are also consistent with a parotid gland hemorrhage. The CT scan shows an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces. This is the typical appearance of a parotid gland hemorrhage.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and CT scan findings are all consistent with a parotid gland hemorrhage. The patient's INR was 4.4, which is above the therapeutic range for warfarin. This suggests that the patient is at increased risk for bleeding. The patient's parotid gland hemorrhage is likely caused by her use of warfarin.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Primary parotid gland cancer is unlikely in a patient with no personal or family history of cancer. The patient's CT scan findings do not show any evidence of a mass, which is the typical appearance of a primary parotid gland cancer.
* Parotid gland lymphoma is also unlikely in a patient with no personal or family history of cancer. The patient's CT scan findings do not show any evidence of a mass, which is the typical appearance of a parotid gland lymphoma.
* Benign parotid gland tumor is also unlikely in a patient with no personal or family history of cancer. The patient's CT scan findings do not show any evidence of a mass, which is the typical appearance of a benign parotid gland tumor.

 11%|█         | 170/1525 [42:31<5:28:32, 14.55s/it]The correct diagnosis is lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis (L-CAI). This is a rare, self-limited disorder of unknown etiology that affects infants and young children. It is characterized by the development of well-demarcated, symmetrically distributed areas of skin atrophy and lipoatrophy, typically involving the trunk and extremities. The lesions are often preceded by a period of erythema and induration. L-CAI is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and confirmed with skin biopsy. There is no specific treatment for L-CAI, and most cases resolve spontaneously within a few years.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Morphea is a chronic, autoimmune disorder of the skin characterized by the formation of hard, white plaques. It is not typically associated with lipoatrophy.
* Lupus panniculitis is a rare, autoimmune disorder of the skin and subcutaneous fat that is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules. It is not typically associated with lipoatrophy.
* Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a rare, non-inflammatory disorder of the subcutaneous fat that occurs in newborns. It is characterized by the development of firm, yellow nodules that are typically located on the extremities, buttocks, and abdomen. It is not typically associated with lipoatrophy.

 11%|█         | 171/1525 [42:47<5:40:41, 15.10s/it]The correct answer is C. Metastatic carcinoma.

Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is an inflammatory condition of the skin that is characterized by the presence of granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells. Granulomas can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and exposure to toxins. The patient in this case does not have any of the risk factors for interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, and the skin lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of this condition.

Wolf isotopic response is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of skin lesions after exposure to radioactive isotopes. The skin lesions are usually erythematous and pruritic, and they can be painful. The patient in this case has no history of exposure to radioactive isotopes, and the skin lesions are not in the typical distribution for Wolf isotopic response.

Cutaneous endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue, which is normally found in the uterus, implants in the skin. The skin lesions are usually painful, and they can be associated with other symptoms, such as abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, and infertility. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of cutaneous endometriosis, and the skin lesions are not in the typical distribution for this condition.

Metastatic carcinoma is the spread of cancer from its original site to other parts of the body. The most common type of cancer to metastasize to the skin is breast cancer, followed by lung cancer and melanoma. The skin lesions in metastatic carcinoma are usually erythematous and papular, and they can be painful. The patient in this case has a solid mass on her lower abdomen that had been palpable about 10 years prior, and this mass has rapidly increased in size within the past few months. This is a classic presentation of metastatic carcinoma, and the skin lesions are consistent with this diagnosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Metastatic carcinoma. The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation.

 11%|█▏        | 172/1525 [43:03<5:48:38, 15.46s/it]The correct answer is C. Autosomal recessive parkinsonism.

Progressive supranuclear palsy is a rare, degenerative disorder of the nervous system that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brainstem and basal ganglia. The symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy typically begin in people over the age of 50, and they gradually worsen over time. There is no cure for progressive supranuclear palsy, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disorder that affects multiple parts of the body, including the brain, muscles, heart, and kidneys. It is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down from mother to child. The symptoms of MELAS typically begin in childhood or adolescence, and they can vary from person to person. Some common symptoms include seizures, strokelike episodes, muscle weakness, and learning difficulties. There is no cure for MELAS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

Autosomal recessive parkinsonism is a rare, genetic disorder that causes Parkinson's disease. It is caused by mutations in the PARK2 gene, which is located on chromosome 6. The symptoms of autosomal recessive parkinsonism typically begin in childhood or adolescence, and they are similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease that is caused by other factors, such as aging. There is no cure for autosomal recessive parkinsonism, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

Paraneoplastic syndrome is a group of symptoms that can occur when a cancer affects the nervous system. The symptoms of paraneoplastic syndrome can vary depending on which part of the nervous system is affected. Some common symptoms include weakness, numbness, tingling, and pain. There is no cure for paraneoplastic syndrome, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the correct diagnosis is C. Autosomal recessive parkinsonism. The patient's symptoms are consistent with autosomal recessive parkinsonism, including the onset of symptoms in childhood or adolescence, the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain, and the family history of the disorder. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain all of the patient's symptoms.

 11%|█▏        | 173/1525 [43:20<5:55:32, 15.78s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are concerning for a hematologic malignancy, including fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and enlarging skin lesions. The skin lesions are described as tender, nonfluctuant, and with overlying hemorrhagic crust and necrosis. These findings are consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, which is a skin condition that can be associated with a number of underlying medical conditions, including hematologic malignancies.

The patient's blood work shows a number of abnormalities that are also concerning for a hematologic malignancy, including a low hemoglobin level, a low white blood cell count, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These findings suggest that the patient may have anemia, leukopenia, and inflammation.

The patient's computed tomography scan shows an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a blood clot that forms in a vein. DVTs can be associated with a number of medical conditions, including hematologic malignancies.

The patient's punch biopsies of the scalp and left hand revealed a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with marked edema without vasculitis. This finding is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, but it is also seen in a number of other skin conditions, including vasculitis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a hematologic malignancy. The next step in the patient's management should be to perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics. This test will help to determine the type of hematologic malignancy that the patient has, which will then guide the patient's treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Obtain blood cultures and start intravenous vancomycin. This is the correct treatment for a patient with suspected sepsis, but the patient in this case does not have sepsis.
* C. Perform incision and drainage of the skin lesions. This is the correct treatment for a patient with a skin infection, but the patient in this case does not have a skin infection.
* D. Prescribe oral dapsone. This is the correct treatment for a patient with pyoderma gangrenosum, but the patient in this case has a number of other features that are concerning for a hematologic malignancy.

 11%|█▏        | 174/1525 [43:36<5:59:20, 15.96s/it]The correct answer is C. Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist.

The patient in this case presented with urticaria (hives) 12 days after receiving a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. Urticaria is a common allergic reaction that can be caused by a variety of triggers, including medications, foods, and insect bites. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of urticaria.

The first-line treatment for urticaria is an antihistamine. Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical that is released by the body's immune system in response to an allergic reaction. There are two main types of antihistamines: sedating and nonsedating. Sedating antihistamines can cause drowsiness, so they are usually only recommended for use at night. Nonsedating antihistamines do not cause drowsiness, so they can be taken during the day.

The patient in this case should be prescribed a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose. If her symptoms do not improve after taking the antihistamine for a few days, she can increase the dose or switch to a different type of antihistamine. If her symptoms are severe, she may need to take a short course of oral steroids.

It is important to note that urticaria can be a sign of a more serious allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause swelling of the throat and airways, difficulty breathing, and low blood pressure. If the patient develops any of these symptoms, she should seek immediate medical attention.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Advise the patient against future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination because of allergy) is incorrect because the patient's urticaria is likely a mild allergic reaction that is not associated with a significant risk of anaphylaxis. The patient should be advised to continue to monitor her symptoms and to seek medical attention if they worsen.
* Option B (Prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and refer for allergy testing) is incorrect because the patient's urticaria is not a severe allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment with epinephrine. The patient should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation and testing.
* Option D (Prescribe oral prednisone (60 mg per day for 5 days)) is incorrect because oral steroids are not typically used to treat mild allergic reactions. The patient should only be prescribed oral steroids if her symptoms are severe and do not improve with antihistamines.

 11%|█▏        | 175/1525 [43:50<5:42:38, 15.23s/it]The correct answer is B. Greater auricular nerve neuroma.

The patient has a history of left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. Warthin tumors are benign tumors of the parotid gland that are thought to arise from the intercalated ducts. They are the second most common type of parotid tumor, after pleomorphic adenomas.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with a greater auricular nerve neuroma. Greater auricular nerve neuromas are benign tumors that arise from the greater auricular nerve. The greater auricular nerve is a sensory nerve that supplies sensation to the skin of the ear and the lateral neck.

The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a greater auricular nerve neuroma. The patient's history of left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before is a risk factor for the development of a greater auricular nerve neuroma. The patient's pain in the operative site is consistent with a neuroma. The patient's physical examination findings of a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle is also consistent with a neuroma. The patient's MRI scan results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. This is also consistent with a neuroma, as neuromas are typically small, well-circumscribed lesions that are not seen on imaging studies.

The patient's excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule showed a greater auricular nerve neuroma. This is the definitive diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is a common finding in the neck. It is a benign condition that is not associated with pain.

C. Recurrent parotid tumor is a possibility, but the patient's MRI scan results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands. This makes recurrent parotid tumor less likely.

D. Metastatic tumor deposit is also a possibility, but the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with metastatic disease.

Bleb revision with excision of the mass is not the correct answer because it would not address the underlying cause of the mass, which is likely a complication of the Ahmed valve. The Ahmed valve is a type of glaucoma drainage device that is implanted in the eye to help lower intraocular pressure. In some cases, the valve can become blocked or infected, which can lead to the formation of a subconjunctival mass. Bleb revision with excision of the mass would not remove the blockage or infection, and it would likely not prevent the mass from recurring.

Fine-needle aspiration of the mass is not the correct answer because it would not address the underlying cause of the mass. Fine-needle aspiration is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the mass to remove a sample of tissue for testing. However, fine-needle aspiration does not remove the entire mass, and it does not address the underlying cause of the mass. In this case, the underlying cause is likely a complication of the Ahmed valve. Fine-needle aspiration would not prevent the mass from recurring.

Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity is not the correct answer because it would not address the underlying cause of the mass. Silicone oil is a type of oil that is sometimes used to treat retinal detachment. In this case, the silicone oil is not the cause of the mass. The mass is likely a complication of the Ahmed valve. Removing the silicone oil would not address the underlying cause of the mass, and it would likely not prevent the mass from recurring.

Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve is the correct answer because it addresses the underlying cause of the mass and removes the mass. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a procedure in which a laser is used to destroy the ciliary body, which is the part of the eye that produces aqueous humor. Aqueous humor is a fluid that helps to maintain the pressure in the eye. Destroying the ciliary body can help to lower intraocular pressure. Removal of the mass and Ahmed valve is necessary to prevent the mass from recurring.

 12%|█▏        | 177/1525 [44:18<5:26:36, 14.54s/it]The correct answer is C: Perform bone marrow biopsy. The patient has anemia and leukopenia, which are both signs of bone marrow disease. The elevated inflammatory markers and diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment on MRI are also consistent with a bone marrow disorder. Lumbar puncture was performed and showed normal CSF findings, which makes idiopathic intracranial hypertension less likely. Repeating serial ophthalmic examinations or lumbar punctures would not provide additional information at this time. Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to perform a bone marrow biopsy to further evaluate the underlying cause of her anemia and leukopenia.

A. Repeat serial ophthalmic examinations would not provide additional information at this time. The patient's optic disc edema is already known to be present, and repeating ophthalmic examinations would not change the management of the patient.

B. Diagnosing and treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension is not appropriate in this patient because she does not have the classic symptoms of this condition, which are headache, papilledema, and vision loss. The patient's headache is not severe, and her vision is normal. In addition, her MRI findings are not consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

D. Repeating serial lumbar punctures would not provide additional information at this time. The patient's lumbar puncture showed normal CSF findings, and there is no indication that her condition is worsening. Repeating the lumbar puncture would not change the management of the patient.

 12%|█▏        | 178/1525 [44:30<5:11:03, 13.86s/it]The correct answer is B. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit.

The patient in this case has new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze. The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, Horner syndrome, and third cranial nerve palsy. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. Thyroid eye disease is a condition that occurs when the thyroid gland becomes overactive, and it can cause inflammation of the muscles and tissues around the eye. Horner syndrome is a condition that occurs when there is damage to the sympathetic nervous system, and it can cause ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis (decreased sweating) on the affected side of the face. Third cranial nerve palsy is a condition that occurs when there is damage to the third cranial nerve, and it can cause ptosis, diplopia, and an inability to move the eye up and in.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's diplopia is fluctuating, which is a classic symptom of myasthenia gravis. The patient's ptosis improved after application of an ice pack, which is a sign that the ptosis is caused by muscle weakness rather than a mechanical obstruction. The patient does not have any other symptoms that would suggest thyroid eye disease, Horner syndrome, or third cranial nerve palsy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit. An MRI can help to identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. If the MRI is normal, the patient should be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation. If the MRI shows evidence of myasthenia gravis, the patient will be started on treatment with medications that suppress the immune system.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Serum testing for autoantibodies is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with myasthenia gravis.
* Revision ptosis repair is not necessary in this case because the patient's ptosis is likely caused by myasthenia gravis, which is a treatable condition.
* Symptomatic management with cholinesterase inhibitors is not a definitive treatment for myasthenia gravis. Cholinesterase inhibitors can help to improve the patient's symptoms, but they do not cure the underlying disease.

The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use.

On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B). In the interim, she received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.

The patient's presentation is concerning for choroidal melanoma, which is a primary intraocular malignancy that can metastasize to other organs. The most common sites of metastasis are the liver, lungs, and brain. Therefore, it is important to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm in patients with choroidal melanoma.

The following are some of the tests that can be used to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm:

* Liver function tests
* Complete blood count
* Chest X-ray
* Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain

If an occult systemic neoplasm is found, treatment will be directed at the primary tumor and any metastatic lesions.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

* Investigate liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction: This is not necessary in a patient with choroidal melanoma.
* Drain the hemorrhage with scleral windows: This is not a definitive treatment for choroidal melanoma.
* Treat with plaque brachytherapy: This is a treatment option for choroidal melanoma, but it is not appropriate for all patients.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Rule out an occult systemic neoplasm.

Radiation recall myelopathy is a rare but serious complication of radiation therapy. It occurs when the spinal cord is exposed to radiation therapy, and then later, the patient is treated with a medication that can damage the spinal cord. The medication can be a chemotherapeutic agent, such as doxorubicin, or it can be a corticosteroid, such as prednisone.

The symptoms of radiation recall myelopathy usually develop within a few weeks of starting treatment with the medication. The symptoms can include numbness, weakness, and pain in the arms and legs. In severe cases, the patient may lose the ability to walk.

There is no cure for radiation recall myelopathy, but the symptoms can be treated with steroids and other medications. The prognosis for patients with radiation recall myelopathy is variable, but most patients will make a full recovery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic progression: The patient has no evidence of metastatic progression on her PET/CT scan.
* Radiation necrosis: Radiation necrosis is a rare but serious complication of radiation therapy. It occurs when the spinal cord is exposed to high doses of radiation, and the tissue dies. The symptoms of radiation necrosis usually develop months or years after radiation therapy. The patient in this case developed her symptoms within weeks of starting treatment with doxorubicin.
* Spinal cord infarct: A spinal cord infarct is a stroke that occurs in the spinal cord. It is caused by a blockage of the blood supply to the spinal cord. The symptoms of a spinal cord infarct usually develop suddenly. The patient in this case developed her symptoms gradually over a period of weeks.

An encephalocele is a protrusion of brain tissue and meninges through a defect in the skull. It is a congenital anomaly, meaning it is present at birth. Encephaloceles can occur anywhere on the skull, but are most common in the occipital region (back of the head).

The symptoms of encephalocele vary depending on the size and location of the defect. Small encephaloceles may not cause any symptoms, while larger ones can cause problems with vision, hearing, speech, and swallowing. Encephaloceles can also increase the risk of infection and meningitis.

The treatment for encephalocele is surgery to close the defect in the skull and cover the exposed brain tissue. The goal of surgery is to prevent further brain damage and to improve the cosmetic appearance of the defect.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Deep lobe parotid tumor: A deep lobe parotid tumor is a type of salivary gland tumor that occurs in the deep lobe of the parotid gland. The parotid gland is a salivary gland located in the front of the ear. Deep lobe parotid tumors are rare and usually benign (noncancerous). Symptoms of a deep lobe parotid tumor can include pain, swelling, and numbness in the face. Treatment for a deep lobe parotid tumor is surgery to remove the tumor.
* Trigeminal schwannoma: A trigeminal schwannoma is a type of tumor that grows on the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve is a cranial nerve that controls sensation in the face and motor function in the jaw. Trigeminal schwannomas are rare and usually benign (noncancerous). Symptoms of a trigeminal schwannoma can include facial pain, numbness, and weakness in the face. Treatment for a trigeminal schwannoma is surgery to remove the tumor.
* Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: A juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a rare type of tumor that grows in the nasopharynx (the space behind the nose). Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are usually benign (noncancerous) but can be locally aggressive. Symptoms of a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma can include nasal obstruction, epistaxis (nosebleed), facial pain, and hearing loss. Treatment for a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is surgery to remove the tumor.

Eczema is a common skin condition that causes dry, itchy skin. It is not caused by water immersion, and it does not typically have the features described in the case, such as white papules, white hyperkeratosis spots, and excessive wrinkling.

Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma is a rare genetic skin condition that causes small, raised bumps on the hands and feet. It is not caused by water immersion, and it does not typically have the features described in the case.

Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma is a rare skin condition that causes red, scaly skin on the hands and feet. It is not caused by water immersion, and it does not typically have the features described in the case.

Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma is a rare skin condition that causes white papules, white hyperkeratosis spots, and excessive wrinkling on the hands and feet after water immersion. It is caused by a mutation in the gene SPRR2, which codes for a protein called serine palmitoyltransferase. This protein is involved in the production of lipids, which are essential for the skin barrier. When the SPRR2 gene is mutated, the skin barrier is disrupted, and water can easily penetrate the skin. This causes the skin to become dry, itchy, and inflamed.

The patient in the case presented with symmetrical white papules, white hyperkeratosis spots, and excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion. The lesions worsened in summer and remitted in winter. He had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands. Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition. A skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand showed hyperkeratosis, dilated eccrine ducts in the epidermis and dermis, and hyperplasia of the eccrine sweat glands.

The findings on physical examination and skin biopsy are consistent with a diagnosis of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma. The patient's history of the lesions worsening in summer and remitting in winter is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings on physical examination and skin biopsy.

 12%|█▏        | 183/1525 [45:48<5:26:58, 14.62s/it]The correct answer is A. Pressure necrosis.

Pressure necrosis is a type of skin damage that occurs when pressure is applied to the skin for a prolonged period of time. This can lead to the death of the skin cells and underlying tissues. Pressure necrosis is most commonly seen in people who are bedridden or who are in a wheelchair. It can also occur in people who are obese or who have poor circulation.

In the case of the patient in the question, he developed pressure necrosis on his ears after being intubated and placed in a prone position. This position puts pressure on the ears, which can lead to necrosis if the pressure is not relieved.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Levamisole-induced vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is caused by the medication levamisole. This medication is used to treat parasitic infections. Vasculitis is a condition that occurs when the blood vessels become inflamed. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, fever, and joint pain.
* COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy) is a condition that occurs in people with COVID-19. This condition is characterized by the narrowing of the blood vessels in the extremities, which can lead to ischemia (lack of blood flow) and necrosis.
* Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection that is caused by a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This infection is most commonly seen in people who are hospitalized or who have a weakened immune system. It can cause skin lesions that are painful and that may progress to necrosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Pressure necrosis. The other choices are incorrect for the reasons described above.

 12%|█▏        | 184/1525 [45:58<5:00:03, 13.43s/it]The correct answer is A. Obtain a chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel.

The patient in this case presents with a number of concerning features, including digital erythema, painful finger ulcers, dyspnea on exertion, and livedo racemosa. These findings are suggestive of a number of possible conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, and dermatomyositis.

SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. Symptoms of SLE can vary widely from person to person, but common features include fatigue, fever, joint pain, and a characteristic butterfly rash across the cheeks and nose. SLE is often diagnosed with the help of blood tests that look for antibodies associated with the disease.

Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin to become thick and tight. It can also affect the internal organs, including the lungs, heart, and kidneys. Symptoms of scleroderma can vary widely from person to person, but common features include Raynaud's phenomenon (a condition in which the fingers and toes turn white, blue, or red when exposed to cold), skin tightening, and joint pain. Scleroderma is often diagnosed with the help of blood tests that look for antibodies associated with the disease.

Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the muscles and skin. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as SLE and scleroderma. Symptoms of dermatomyositis can vary widely from person to person, but common features include muscle weakness, skin rash, and fatigue. Dermatomyositis is often diagnosed with the help of blood tests that look for antibodies associated with the disease.

In this case, the patient's history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic hepatitis B increases her risk of developing an autoimmune disease. Her current symptoms of digital erythema, painful finger ulcers, dyspnea on exertion, and livedo racemosa are also consistent with an autoimmune disease. Therefore, the next step in her management should be to obtain a chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel.

A chest CT scan can help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a pulmonary embolism or cancer. A myositis-specific autoantibody panel can help to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. If the patient is diagnosed with dermatomyositis, she will likely need to be treated with a combination of medications, including steroids, immunosuppressants, and physical therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

B. Ordering testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody is not the most appropriate next step because this antibody is associated with SLE, not dermatomyositis.

C. Ordering testing for anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies is not the most appropriate next step because these antibodies are associated with scleroderma, not dermatomyositis.

D. Performing a muscle biopsy is not the most appropriate next step because this is a more invasive procedure than obtaining a chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel. A muscle biopsy is typically only performed if the diagnosis is unclear after other testing has been done.

 12%|█▏        | 185/1525 [46:15<5:20:04, 14.33s/it]The correct answer is D. Start intravenous glucocorticoids.

The patient in the case has necrotizing fasciitis, a serious infection of the skin and underlying tissues that can be rapidly fatal. Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by a group of bacteria called Group A streptococcus (GAS), which are normally present on the skin but can cause infection when they enter the body through a break in the skin.

The classic presentation of necrotizing fasciitis is fever, pain, and swelling in the affected area. The skin may become red, bruised, or discolored, and may have a dusky or purplish appearance. The patient may also develop blisters or bullae, which are large fluid-filled sacs. In some cases, the skin may become necrotic (dead) and slough off.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics and surgery. Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria that are causing the infection, and surgery is used to remove the dead tissue. In severe cases, amputation may be necessary.

Glucocorticoids are a type of medication that can be used to treat necrotizing fasciitis. Glucocorticoids help to reduce inflammation and swelling, which can help to improve blood flow to the affected area and reduce the risk of death. Glucocorticoids can also help to reduce the risk of complications, such as sepsis (a life-threatening infection of the blood).

In the case presented, the patient has a number of risk factors for necrotizing fasciitis, including a recent childbirth, a break in the skin (the methergine injection site), and fever. The patient also has clinical features that are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, including fever, pain, and swelling in the right thigh. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but this does not rule out necrotizing fasciitis, as GAS can be difficult to culture.

The most appropriate treatment for the patient in this case is to start intravenous glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids will help to reduce inflammation and swelling, which can help to improve blood flow to the affected area and reduce the risk of death. Glucocorticoids can also help to reduce the risk of complications, such as sepsis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Add intravenous amphotericin B is incorrect because amphotericin B is an antifungal medication, and the patient's infection is caused by bacteria.
* B. Further surgical debridement is incorrect because the patient has already undergone two surgical debridements, and further debridement is unlikely to be beneficial.
* C. Start hyperbaric oxygen therapy is incorrect because hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not a standard treatment for necrotizing fasciitis.
It is reasoning
 12%|█▏        | 186/1525 [46:27<5:07:22, 13.77s/it]The correct answer is A. Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

ANCAs are antibodies that target the cytoplasm of neutrophils. They are found in the blood of people with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg-Strauss syndrome. These diseases are characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to organ damage.

The patient in the case presentation has several features that are consistent with a diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or Churg-Strauss syndrome. She has joint pain, which is a common symptom of these diseases. She also has a deformity of the nasal bridge, which can be caused by inflammation of the blood vessels in the nose. Additionally, her urinalysis shows evidence of kidney damage, which is a common complication of these diseases.

To confirm a diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or Churg-Strauss syndrome, the patient should have her ANCA levels checked. ANCAs are found in the blood of most people with these diseases. If the patient's ANCA levels are elevated, she will likely be diagnosed with one of these diseases.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not provide any useful information in the diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or Churg-Strauss syndrome.

B. Check antinuclear antibody  and complement levels: Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are antibodies that target the nucleus of cells. They are found in the blood of people with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a disease that can affect many different parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart.

Complement is a system of proteins that helps the body fight infection. Complement levels can be decreased in people with SLE. However, decreased complement levels are not specific for SLE and can be found in other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, checking ANA levels and complement levels would not be helpful in the diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or Churg-Strauss syndrome.

C. Obtain conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries: Conventional angiography is a procedure that uses X-rays to visualize the blood vessels. It is used to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis).

Obtaining conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries would not be helpful in the diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or Churg-Strauss syndrome. These diseases do not typically cause narrowing of the arteries.

D. Order rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test: Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) are tests that are used to detect syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rash, fever, and muscle aches.

Ordering RPR and FTA-ABS would not be helpful in the diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or Churg-Strauss syndrome. These diseases are not caused by syphilis.

 12%|█▏        | 187/1525 [46:42<5:11:43, 13.98s/it]The correct answer is B. Change therapies for Crohn disease. The patient has a history of Crohn disease, and his medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation. The patient's current symptoms, including bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, diplopia, and pain with extraocular movement, are consistent with orbital inflammation. Orbital inflammation is a known side effect of ustekinumab, and the patient's symptoms resolved when he was started on prednisone. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. The patient's symptoms recurred when he was weaned off of prednisone, suggesting that he may need to continue taking prednisone or that he may need to be switched to a different medication for his Crohn disease. Further imaging to exclude a solid-organ primary malignancy is not indicated, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with orbital inflammation and there is no evidence of a solid-organ primary malignancy on his imaging studies. Further thyroid function tests and thyroid imaging are not indicated, as the patient's thyroid function tests and thyroid imaging studies are normal.

 12%|█▏        | 188/1525 [46:58<5:26:04, 14.63s/it]The correct answer is C. Genetic testing. The patient has multifocal macular lesions, which are a characteristic finding of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). AEPVM is a rare, bilateral retinal disorder that is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple, yellow-white lesions in the macula. The lesions typically resolve spontaneously within a few months, but can leave permanent visual impairment. AEPVM is thought to be caused by a genetic mutation, and genetic testing can be used to identify the specific mutation that is responsible for the disease. Genetic testing can also be used to screen family members of patients with AEPVM, as they may be at increased risk of developing the disease.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Computed tomographic scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis is not indicated in patients with AEPVM. AEPVM is a non-neoplastic condition, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is associated with malignancy.
* B. Repeat anti-VEGF treatment is not indicated in patients with AEPVM. Anti-VEGF treatment is used to treat choroidal neovascularization, which is a complication of age-related macular degeneration. AEPVM is not associated with choroidal neovascularization.
* D. Antiretinal antibody testing is not indicated in patients with AEPVM. Antiretinal antibody testing is used to diagnose autoimmune diseases that can affect the retina, such as multiple sclerosis and lupus. AEPVM is not an autoimmune disease.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Genetic testing. Genetic testing is the best option for this patient because it can help to identify the specific mutation that is responsible for her AEPVM. This information can be used to provide her with more accurate information about her prognosis and to screen her family members for the disease.

 12%|█▏        | 189/1525 [47:14<5:33:41, 14.99s/it]The correct answer is C. Sclerectomy in the left eye.

A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is a procedure that creates a small opening in the iris, the colored part of the eye. This opening allows fluid to flow out of the eye and helps to prevent angle closure glaucoma.

In this case, the patient had a successful LPI in her left eye, but she developed worsening angle closure two weeks later. This is likely due to the formation of choroidal detachments, which are pockets of fluid that can develop between the choroid, the vascular layer of the eye, and the sclera, the white of the eye. Choroidal detachments can cause the iris to bulge forward, which can narrow the angle between the iris and the cornea and block the flow of fluid out of the eye.

A sclerectomy is a surgical procedure that involves making a small incision in the sclera and then removing a small piece of tissue. This procedure can help to lower intraocular pressure by increasing the drainage of fluid from the eye.

In this case, the patient's vision had declined despite treatment with systemic corticosteroids. This suggests that she may have a permanent narrowing of the angle between the iris and the cornea. A sclerectomy would be the most appropriate treatment for this condition.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Repeat LPI in the left eye: This would not be effective in treating the choroidal detachments that are causing the patient's symptoms.
* Perform an LPI in the right eye: This would not be necessary, as the patient's right eye is not affected.
* Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye: This would not be effective in treating the choroidal detachments that are causing the patient's symptoms.

 12%|█▏        | 190/1525 [47:26<5:13:24, 14.09s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform ciliary body–choroidal biopsy in the right eye.

The patient in this case has a history of autoimmune pancreatitis, recurrent colon polyps, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He developed rapid, painless vision loss of both eyes over a 2-week period 6 months after cataract surgery. Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes. No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes VKH syndrome, sarcoidosis, and intraocular lymphoma. VKH syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disorder that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by uveitis, poliosis, alopecia, and vitiligo. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect any organ system, including the eyes. Intraocular lymphoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that can occur in the retina, vitreous, or choroid.

The next step in management of this patient is to perform a ciliary body–choroidal biopsy in the right eye. This procedure will allow for definitive diagnosis of the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. If the biopsy reveals VKH syndrome, the patient will be treated with systemic steroids. If the biopsy reveals sarcoidosis, the patient will be treated with systemic steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. If the biopsy reveals intraocular lymphoma, the patient will be treated with systemic chemotherapy.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the next best step in management of this patient. Option A, performing a diagnostic vitrectomy in the right eye, is not indicated in this patient because the vitreous inflammation is not severe enough to warrant vitrectomy. Option B, injecting intravitreal antibiotics for endophthalmitis in both eyes, is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of endophthalmitis. Option C, treating the patient with systemic steroids for presumed VKH syndrome, is a reasonable option, but it is not the next best step in management because the diagnosis of VKH syndrome has not been confirmed.

Mumps is an acute viral infection of the parotid glands, which are the salivary glands located in front of the ears. It is characterized by fever, headache, and painful swelling of the parotid glands. The swelling usually resolves within 1-2 weeks.

Alcoholic sialosis is a condition that occurs when the salivary glands become inflamed and swollen due to alcohol abuse. It is characterized by dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, and pain in the salivary glands.

Sjogren disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva. It is characterized by dry eyes, dry mouth, and fatigue.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. It is characterized by inflammation, ulceration, and scarring of the intestinal mucosa.

The patient in the case report presents with several features that are consistent with Crohn disease, including:

* Bilateral buccal facial swelling
* Oral ulceration
* Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation on biopsy

The patient's medical history is also significant for depression and prior alcohol use disorder, which are both risk factors for Crohn disease.

Laryngeal cancer is the most common type of cancer of the larynx, but it is rare in people who are not smokers. The patient in this case is not a smoker, so laryngeal cancer is less likely.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of organs and tissues that help the body fight infection. Lymphoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the lymph nodes. The patient in this case does not have any enlarged lymph nodes, so lymphoma is less likely.

Esophageal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat to the stomach. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of esophageal cancer, such as difficulty swallowing, so esophageal cancer is less likely.

Metastatic colon cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the colon and then spreads to other parts of the body. The patient in this case has a left supraclavicular node, which is a lymph node that is located in the left side of the neck. This type of lymph node is often involved in metastatic colon cancer. The patient also has a PET/CT scan that shows increased FDG uptake in the left supraclavicular node. FDG is a type of sugar that is used by cancer cells. Increased FDG uptake on a PET/CT scan is a sign of cancer.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis (MMDH) is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by the eruption of multiple, small, finger-like projections on the skin. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but they may cause itching or discomfort in some cases. MMDH is most commonly seen in adults, and it is more common in women than men. The exact cause of MMDH is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for MMDH, but the condition can be treated with topical medications or laser therapy.

The exact cause of lichen spinulosus is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for lichen spinulosus, but the condition can be treated with topical medications or light therapy.
* Porokeratosis is a group of rare, inherited skin conditions characterized by the eruption of small, wart-like lesions on the skin. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but they may cause itching or discomfort in some cases. Porokeratosis is most commonly seen in adults, and it is more common in men than women. The exact cause of porokeratosis is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a mutation in a gene that controls the production of keratin, a protein that makes up the outer layer of the skin. There is no cure for porokeratosis, but the condition can be treated with topical medications or laser therapy.
* Viral warts are contagious skin lesions caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts can appear anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the hands, feet, and genitals.

NMLE is a rare, chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the presence of neutrophils in the dermis. It is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but it can also occur as an isolated cutaneous disorder.

The clinical features of NMLE are variable, but typically include papules, plaques, and nodules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions may be erythematous, violaceous, or hyperpigmented. They may also be pruritic or painful.

The diagnosis of NMLE is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. The characteristic histopathologic features of NMLE include a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of neutrophils, with associated leukocytoclasia and fibrinoid necrosis.

There is no cure for NMLE, but the condition can be managed with topical and systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, immunosuppressive agents may also be necessary.

 13%|█▎        | 195/1525 [48:49<6:01:04, 16.29s/it]The correct answer is B. Consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery.

The patient has developed severe mitral regurgitation (MR) after the placement of a peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD). MR is a condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left atrium during systole. This can lead to heart failure, pulmonary edema, and other complications.

There are several possible causes of MR in this patient. One possibility is that the pVAD is causing the mitral valve to prolapse, or bulge back into the left atrium. Another possibility is that the pVAD is causing the mitral valve to become inflamed or scarred. Finally, it is also possible that the patient had pre-existing MR that was exacerbated by the placement of the pVAD.

Regardless of the cause, the patient's MR is severe and requires treatment. The most definitive treatment for MR is mitral valve surgery. This involves repairing or replacing the mitral valve. In some cases, mitral valve surgery can be performed through a minimally invasive approach.

If the patient is not a candidate for mitral valve surgery, other treatments may be considered. These include medical therapy with vasodilators, diuretics, and beta-blockers. In some cases, a percutaneous mitral valve repair may be an option. This is a minimally invasive procedure that involves using a catheter to repair the mitral valve.

The patient's condition is serious and requires urgent treatment. The best course of action is to consult with a cardiovascular surgeon to discuss the options for mitral valve surgery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Remove pVAD at bedside is incorrect because the patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires the support of the pVAD. Removing the pVAD could lead to cardiac arrest and death.
* Option C: Consult interventional cardiology to discuss transcatheter mitral valve repair is incorrect because the patient is not a candidate for this procedure. Transcatheter mitral valve repair is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to repair mitral valve regurgitation in patients who are not candidates for open-heart surgery. However, the patient in this case has severe mitral regurgitation and requires mitral valve surgery.
* Option D: Begin medical therapy with vasodilators for afterload reduction is incorrect because this treatment will not address the underlying cause of the patient's MR. Vasodilators are medications that relax the blood vessels, which can reduce the workload on the heart. However, they will not repair the mitral valve and will not prevent the patient from developing complications from her MR.

 13%|█▎        | 196/1525 [48:58<5:16:42, 14.30s/it]The correct answer is "What to Do Next". The patient has a history of normal-tension glaucoma, which is a type of glaucoma that does not cause high eye pressure. However, it can still damage the optic nerve and cause vision loss. The patient's current symptoms, including a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye, are consistent with macular edema, which is a swelling of the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. Macular edema can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain medications. In this case, the most likely cause is the patient's normal-tension glaucoma.

The next step in the management of this patient is to determine the cause of the macular edema and to treat the underlying condition. In this case, the patient is already being treated for normal-tension glaucoma with latanoprost. However, the macular edema is not responding to treatment. Therefore, the next step is to add a second medication to the treatment regimen. One option is to use a corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone. Corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and swelling, which can help to improve vision. However, corticosteroids can also have side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation. Therefore, they should only be used for short-term treatment.

Another option is to use a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen. NSAIDs can also reduce inflammation and swelling, but they do not have the same side effects as corticosteroids. However, NSAIDs may not be as effective as corticosteroids in treating macular edema.

The patient should also be advised to make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of further vision loss. These changes include quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

The patient should also be monitored regularly for changes in vision. If the macular edema does not improve with treatment, the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove the fluid from the macula.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the next step in the management of this patient. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, not macular edema caused by normal-tension glaucoma. Fluorescein angiography is a test that is used to diagnose and monitor certain eye diseases, but it is not the next step in the management of this patient. OCT of the optic nerve head is a test that is used to evaluate the optic nerve, but it is not the next step in the management of this patient. OCT-angiography of the macula is a test that is used to evaluate the macula, but it is not the next step in the management of this patient.

 13%|█▎        | 197/1525 [49:15<5:31:04, 14.96s/it]The correct answer is A. Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results. The patient's history of intravenous drug abuse and multiple sexual partners puts him at high risk for HIV and syphilis. Both of these infections can cause optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve that can lead to vision loss. Obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results will help to determine if either of these infections is the cause of the patient's vision loss.

B is incorrect because intravenous methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. However, the patient's vision loss is not due to inflammation, so it is not appropriate to administer this medication.

C is incorrect because intravitreal foscarnet is an antiviral medication that is used to treat viral infections of the eye. However, the patient's vision loss is not due to a viral infection, so it is not appropriate to administer this medication.

D is incorrect because a computed tomographic scan of the brain is a test that is used to diagnose brain tumors, stroke, and other neurological disorders. However, the patient's vision loss is not due to a neurological disorder, so it is not necessary to order this test.

 13%|█▎        | 198/1525 [49:27<5:11:05, 14.07s/it]The correct answer is C. Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling.

The patient has a history of trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. He presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain. He had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. He was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. He underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. His eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening. Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. He was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. His vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque.

The most likely diagnosis is endophthalmitis, a serious infection of the eye that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. The patient's history of trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection puts him at increased risk for endophthalmitis. The initial treatment for endophthalmitis is intravenous antibiotics. However, if the infection is not responding to treatment, or if the patient's condition is worsening, additional surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue and debris from the eye.

In this case, the patient's eye pain has worsened significantly, and his vision has continued to decline. This suggests that the infection is not responding to treatment. In addition, the ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening, which is a sign of inflammation. This suggests that the infection may have spread to the sclera, the white of the eye.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's management should be to repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling. This will allow the doctor to culture the infection and determine which antibiotics are most effective against the infecting organism. In addition, the doctor may want to consider performing additional surgery to remove infected tissue and debris from the eye.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Start topical and systemic steroids: Steroids are not effective against bacterial infections. In addition, they can suppress the immune system, which can make the infection worse.
* B. Switch to intravenous meropenem: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria. However, it is not the most effective antibiotic against the infecting organism in this case.
* D. Observe while receiving current therapy: Observing the patient without taking any further action is not an appropriate management option. The patient's condition is worsening, and he is at risk of losing his vision.

 13%|█▎        | 199/1525 [49:44<5:28:30, 14.86s/it]The correct answer is B. Atypical mycobacterium infection.

The patient is an 8-year-old boy with a 3-year history of a fluctuating right parotid mass. He has not had any trauma to the area and is not immunocompromised. He has received multiple rounds of antibiotics in the past 2 months, but the mass has not responded to treatment. Outside imaging studies have shown a cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional attempted incision and drainage of the area, but this was unsuccessful.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of atypical mycobacterium infection. Atypical mycobacteria are a group of bacteria that are not typically associated with human disease. However, they can cause infection in certain individuals, such as those who are immunocompromised or who have underlying medical conditions. Atypical mycobacterial infections can occur in any part of the body, but they are most common in the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin.

The most common symptoms of atypical mycobacterial infection are fever, night sweats, and fatigue. The patient may also have weight loss, muscle aches, and joint pain. In some cases, the infection can cause a skin rash or lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of atypical mycobacterial infection is made based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRIs, can show the presence of an infection in the parotid gland. Laboratory tests, such as blood cultures and sputum cultures, can be used to identify the specific type of atypical mycobacterium that is causing the infection.

The treatment of atypical mycobacterial infection typically involves a combination of antibiotics and surgery. Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria, and surgery may be necessary to remove the infected tissue. The patient may also receive supportive care, such as fluids and nutrition.

The prognosis for atypical mycobacterial infection is generally good. With treatment, most patients recover completely. However, some patients may experience long-term complications, such as scarring or nerve damage.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Branchial cleft cyst: Branchial cleft cysts are congenital anomalies that develop from abnormal remnants of the branchial arches. They are typically located in the neck, but they can also occur in the parotid gland. Branchial cleft cysts are usually asymptomatic, but they can become infected or cause pain. The diagnosis of a branchial cleft cyst is made based on clinical findings and imaging studies. Treatment typically involves surgical excision of the cyst.
* Chronic sialadenitis with abscess: Chronic sialadenitis is a long-term inflammation of the salivary glands. It can be caused by a number of factors, including infection, obstruction of the salivary ducts, and autoimmune disorders. Chronic sialadenitis can cause pain, swelling, and tenderness of the affected gland. The diagnosis of chronic sialadenitis is made based on clinical findings and imaging studies. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, massage, and warm compresses. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected gland.
* Venolymphatic malformation: Venolymphatic malformations are congenital anomalies that develop from abnormal connections between veins and lymphatic vessels. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck. Venolymphatic malformations are typically asymptomatic, but they can become infected or cause pain. The diagnosis of a venolymphatic malformation is made based on clinical findings and imaging studies. Treatment typically involves surgery or sclerotherapy.

 13%|█▎        | 200/1525 [50:01<5:42:03, 15.49s/it]The correct answer is C. Axillary web syndrome.

Axillary web syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when the lymphatic vessels in the armpit become blocked. This can happen after surgery, radiation therapy, or infection. The blocked lymphatic vessels can cause swelling, pain, and a feeling of tightness in the armpit.

In the case presented, the patient had a recent melanoma surgical procedure on the left arm. The patient also had a history of multiple sclerosis, which is treated with subcutaneous interferon beta 1a. Interferon beta 1a can cause inflammation, which can damage the lymphatic vessels.

The patient's physical examination revealed two indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of the arm 5 cm distal to the surgical scar. The larger nodule measured 15 mm in diameter and the smaller nodule measured 4 mm. When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm.

An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed. Histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed dilated and thrombosed lymphatic vessels in the subcutaneous tissue with recanalization. Immunohistochemistry finding was positive for D2-40 (podoplanin), which is a marker of lymphatic vessels.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of axillary web syndrome. The patient's history of melanoma, recent surgery, and treatment with interferon beta 1a are all risk factors for axillary web syndrome. The patient's physical examination findings, including the indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules, the subtle tightness sensation on the arm, and the positive D2-40 immunohistochemical finding, are also consistent with a diagnosis of axillary web syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

* Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia is a rare condition that occurs when the endothelial cells lining blood vessels proliferate. It is not associated with axillary web syndrome.
* Pseudo-aneurysmal metastasis of melanoma is a rare condition that occurs when a melanoma tumor grows into a blood vessel and forms a pseudo-aneurysm. It is not associated with axillary web syndrome.
* Traumatic humeral pseudo-aneurysm is a rare condition that occurs when a blood vessel in the humerus is damaged and forms a pseudo-aneurysm. It is not associated with axillary web syndrome.

 13%|█▎        | 201/1525 [50:17<5:47:04, 15.73s/it]The correct answer is B. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for sustained supraventricular tachycardia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. This suggests that the patient is at risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The patient's wide complex QRS tachycardia on telemetry during administration of sotalol is concerning for a ventricular arrhythmia.

Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring would not be helpful in this case, as it would not provide any information about the mechanism of the patient's arrhythmia. Emergency coronary angiogram would not be helpful, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of coronary artery disease. Exercise treadmill test would not be helpful, as the patient's arrhythmia is not exercise-induced.

Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation is the most appropriate next step in this case. This procedure would allow the cardiologist to determine the mechanism of the patient's arrhythmia and to ablate the arrhythmia if possible.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring: This is a procedure in which the patient wears a Holter monitor for a period of time, typically 24 hours. The Holter monitor records the patient's heart rhythm continuously during this time. This procedure can be helpful in diagnosing arrhythmias that are intermittent or that occur only during specific activities. However, it would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's arrhythmia is continuous and is not related to any specific activity.
* Emergency coronary angiogram: This is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and threaded through the blood vessels to the heart. A dye is then injected into the heart, which allows the cardiologist to visualize the coronary arteries. This procedure is used to diagnose coronary artery disease. However, the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of coronary artery disease, so this procedure would not be helpful in this case.
* Exercise treadmill test: This is a test in which the patient walks or runs on a treadmill while the cardiologist monitors the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram. This test is used to diagnose arrhythmias that are exercise-induced. However, the patient's arrhythmia is not exercise-induced, so this procedure would not be helpful in this case.
* Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation: This is a procedure in which the cardiologist inserts a catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and threads it through the blood vessels to the heart. The cardiologist then uses the catheter to record the electrical activity of the heart. This information is used to determine the mechanism of the patient's arrhythmia. If possible, the cardiologist can then ablate the arrhythmia, which means destroying the tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. This procedure is the most appropriate next step in this case, as it would allow the cardiologist to determine the mechanism of the patient's arrhythmia and to ablate the arrhythmia if possible.

 13%|█▎        | 202/1525 [50:29<5:22:24, 14.62s/it]The correct answer is A. Brain/orbital imaging.

The patient has bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a mass on the right temporal area. These findings are concerning for an orbital or intracranial mass. Orbital imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is the best way to evaluate for these masses.

Reassurance and treatment with cool compresses and artificial tears are not appropriate in this case. The patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious underlying condition, and these treatments will not address the underlying cause.

Contacting Child Protective Services (CPS) is not appropriate in this case. There is no evidence that the patient has been abused or neglected. The patient's symptoms are most likely due to an underlying medical condition.

A serologic workup for bleeding diathesis is not appropriate in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a bleeding diathesis. The patient's ecchymosis and edema are most likely due to an underlying medical condition.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Brain/orbital imaging. The patient's symptoms are concerning for an orbital or intracranial mass, and orbital imaging is the best way to evaluate for these masses.

 13%|█▎        | 203/1525 [50:42<5:13:48, 14.24s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform a comprehensive systemic workup.

The patient in the case presented with a choroidal mass that is suspicious for malignancy. The mass is large, has irregular borders, and is associated with subretinal fluid and hemorrhage. The patient also has a history of gingivitis, which could be a sign of systemic disease.

In order to determine the cause of the choroidal mass, it is important to perform a comprehensive systemic workup. This includes a complete blood count, blood chemistry panel, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and chest X-ray. The patient should also be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.

If the systemic workup is negative, then the patient may be treated with plaque radiotherapy or oral corticosteroids. However, if the systemic workup is positive, then the patient's treatment will need to be tailored to the underlying cause of the choroidal mass.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. Treat with plaque radiotherapy: Plaque radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat choroidal tumors. However, it is not the first-line treatment for choroidal masses that are suspicious for malignancy. The first-line treatment for these masses is to perform a comprehensive systemic workup to determine the underlying cause.
* B. Treat with oral corticosteroids: Oral corticosteroids are a type of medication that is used to reduce inflammation. However, they are not the first-line treatment for choroidal masses that are suspicious for malignancy. The first-line treatment for these masses is to perform a comprehensive systemic workup to determine the underlying cause.
* C. Treat with enucleation: Enucleation is a surgical procedure that involves removing the entire eye. It is the most common treatment for choroidal tumors that have spread to the sclera. However, it is not the first-line treatment for choroidal masses that are suspicious for malignancy. The first-line treatment for these masses is to perform a comprehensive systemic workup to determine the underlying cause.

The patient has a history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. He also has impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid and pyruvate acid. These findings are consistent with mitochondrial disease.

Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from the mother. It is responsible for producing energy for the cells. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA can cause a variety of health problems, including mitochondrial disease.

Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA can help to diagnose mitochondrial disease. It can also be used to identify the specific mutation that is causing the disease. This information can be used to provide genetic counseling and to develop treatment plans.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not test for mitochondrial disease.

A. Sequencing of myosin heavy chain gene is used to diagnose muscular dystrophy.

B. Sequencing of dystropin gene is used to diagnose Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

C. Sequencing of titin gene is used to diagnose titinopathy.

These diseases are caused by mutations in nuclear DNA, not mitochondrial DNA.

 13%|█▎        | 205/1525 [51:10<5:02:48, 13.76s/it]The correct answer is B. Atypical vasculitis.

Actinomycosis is an infection caused by Actinomyces israelii, a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. It is characterized by the formation of sulfur granules, which are aggregates of bacteria and inflammatory cells. Actinomycosis can involve any part of the body, but it is most commonly found in the head and neck, lungs, and abdomen. The patient in this case does not have any clinical features or laboratory findings consistent with actinomycosis.

Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO) is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the skin, joints, bones, and eyes. It is characterized by the development of acneiform lesions, pustules, and hyperostosis (thickening of the bone). SAPHO is most common in young men, and it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The patient in this case does not have any clinical features or laboratory findings consistent with SAPHO.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bone that is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and bone destruction. CRMO is most common in children and young adults, and it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The patient in this case does not have any clinical features or laboratory findings consistent with CRMO.

Atypical vasculitis is a term used to describe a group of vasculitides that do not fit neatly into any of the other categories of vasculitis. Atypical vasculitis can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly found in the skin, kidneys, and lungs. The patient in this case has clinical features and laboratory findings consistent with atypical vasculitis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Atypical vasculitis.

 14%|█▎        | 206/1525 [51:27<5:24:19, 14.75s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction.

The patient presented with a retinal detachment in his left eye. The most common cause of retinal detachment is a tear in the retina, which allows vitreous fluid to leak into the space between the retina and the choroid. This can cause the retina to detach from the back of the eye, leading to vision loss.

The patient's history of travel to Costa Rica suggests that he may have been exposed to an infectious agent that could cause retinal detachment. In particular, toxoplasmosis is a common cause of retinal detachment in people who have traveled to Central and South America. Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite that can be found in cat feces. People can become infected with toxoplasmosis by coming into contact with cat feces, eating undercooked meat, or drinking contaminated water.

The patient's symptoms of fevers, night sweats, and myalgias are consistent with an infection. The patient's cardiomyopathy is also consistent with an infection, as it can be caused by an inflammation of the heart muscle.

The patient's limited infectious workup was negative, but this does not rule out an infection. The patient's symptoms and history suggest that he may have an infection, and further testing is needed to identify the cause of the infection.

Obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction is the best way to identify the cause of the infection. Aqueous humor is the fluid that fills the front chamber of the eye. It can be easily obtained by performing a simple procedure called a paracentesis. The aqueous humor can then be cultured to identify any bacteria or viruses that may be present. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a test that can be used to detect the presence of specific genes. PCR can be used to detect the genes of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.

If the patient is found to have an infection, the appropriate antibiotic or antiviral medication can be started. Treatment of the infection may help to prevent further vision loss.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Injecting intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime is not the best way to identify the cause of the infection. Vancomycin and ceftazidime are antibiotics that can be used to treat bacterial infections. However, they are not effective against all types of bacteria. In addition, injecting antibiotics into the eye can cause serious side effects, such as inflammation of the retina.
* Option C: Performing pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair is not the best way to identify the cause of the infection. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to repair retinal detachments. However, it is not a diagnostic procedure. In addition, pars plana vitrectomy can cause serious side effects, such as inflammation of the eye.
* Option D: Starting oral prednisone is not the best way to identify the cause of the infection. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammation. However, it is not effective against all types of infections. In addition, prednisone can cause serious side effects, such as weight gain and mood changes.

 14%|█▎        | 207/1525 [51:39<5:09:11, 14.08s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform a lacrimal gland biopsy.

The patient has a history of bilateral panuveitis and myeloradiculopathy. She has also had a positive interferon-γ release assay, which is suggestive of tuberculosis. However, she has negative test results for Lyme disease, syphilis, and HIV. Her cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis with an elevated protein level, negative syphilis antibody results, and an absence of organisms on acid-fast bacilli smear, Gram stain, and culture.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas. It can affect any organ system, but the lungs, eyes, skin, and lymph nodes are most commonly involved.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is a biopsy of involved tissue, which shows noncaseating granulomas.

In the case of this patient, a lacrimal gland biopsy is the most appropriate next step. The lacrimal glands are located in the upper and lower eyelids, and they produce tears. A lacrimal gland biopsy can be used to diagnose sarcoidosis, and it can also be used to assess the severity of the disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

A. Start plasmapheresis is not the most appropriate next step because plasmapheresis is not a treatment for sarcoidosis. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma or albumin. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases, thrombotic disorders, and poisoning.

C. Reinitiate RIPE therapy is not the most appropriate next step because RIPE therapy is not a treatment for sarcoidosis. RIPE therapy is a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. It is used to treat tuberculosis.

D. Obtain thoracic lymph node biopsy is not the most appropriate next step because a thoracic lymph node biopsy is not the most sensitive or specific test for sarcoidosis. A thoracic lymph node biopsy can be used to diagnose sarcoidosis, but it is not always necessary. Other tests, such as a gallium scan or a chest CT scan, can be used to diagnose sarcoidosis.

It is characterized by small, red, follicular papules and pustules that develop within 24 hours of sun exposure. The lesions typically resolve spontaneously within 3 to 4 days, but they may recur with subsequent sun exposure.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Papulopustular rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that affects the face. It is characterized by flushing, papules, pustules, and telangiectasias. The lesions typically develop on the central face, but they may also involve the ears, nose, and cheeks.
* Pinpoint papular light eruption is a photosensitive eruption of the face and upper extremities characterized by small, red, papules that develop within 24 hours of sun exposure. The lesions typically resolve spontaneously within 3 to 4 days, but they may recur with subsequent sun exposure.
* Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis is a rare, self-limiting, photosensitive eruption of the face and upper extremities characterized by fever, malaise, and the sudden onset of small, red, follicular papules and pustules that develop within 24 hours of sun exposure. The lesions typically resolve spontaneously within 1 to 2 weeks, but they may recur with subsequent sun exposure.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a history of recurrent pustular eruptions on her face that are exacerbated by sunlight. She has tried various treatments, including broad-spectrum sunscreens, topical and oral antibiotics, and topical ivermectin, but these have not been effective. The physical examination findings are consistent with actinic folliculitis, and the punch biopsy findings show intrafollicular and subcorneal pustule formation. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of actinic folliculitis.

 14%|█▎        | 209/1525 [52:08<5:16:42, 14.44s/it]The correct answer is A. Hair follicle nevus.

A hair follicle nevus is a congenital lesion that is characterized by the presence of multiple hair follicles in a linear or whorled distribution. The lesions are typically skin-colored or slightly darker than the surrounding skin and are often associated with vellus hairs. Hair follicle nevi are usually benign and do not require treatment, although they may be cosmetically disfiguring.

The patient in the case presented with multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions. The clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of hair follicle nevus.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sebaceous nevus is a congenital lesion that is characterized by the presence of multiple sebaceous glands in a linear or whorled distribution. The lesions are typically yellow or orange in color and are often associated with vellus hairs. Sebaceous nevi are usually benign and do not require treatment, although they may be cosmetically disfiguring. However, the patient in the case did not have any sebaceous glands on the lesions.
* Connective tissue nevus is a congenital lesion that is characterized by the presence of increased amounts of connective tissue in the skin. The lesions are typically firm and rubbery and may be associated with pain or tenderness. Connective tissue nevi are usually benign and do not require treatment, although they may be cosmetically disfiguring. However, the patient in the case did not have any connective tissue on the lesions.
* Trichofolliculoma is a benign tumor that arises from hair follicles. The lesions are typically small, firm, and pedunculated. Trichofolliculomas are usually solitary, but they may be multiple. They do not require treatment, although they may be removed for cosmetic reasons. However, the patient in the case had multiple lesions that were distributed along Blaschko lines, which is not typical of trichofolliculoma.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in the case is hair follicle nevus.

The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is a measure of the ability of the lungs to transfer carbon monoxide from the alveoli to the blood. It is a sensitive test for early lung disease.

The patient in this case has an isolated reduced Dlco, meaning that his Dlco is reduced but his forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) are normal. This suggests that the reduced Dlco is not due to a problem with the airways, but rather to a problem with the gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood.

The most common cause of an isolated reduced Dlco is an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. This can occur in a number of conditions, including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and emphysema.

The other choices are incorrect. A is incorrect because the hemoglobin level is normal. B is incorrect because the isolated reduced Dlco is important, even though the FVC and FEV1 are normal. D is incorrect because the isolated reduced Dlco does not reflect early small airway disease.

The patient's history of travel to northeastern Brazil, the presence of a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons, and the elevation of eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid are all consistent with a diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis.

Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and other neurological problems. However, it is not typically associated with a history of travel to Brazil. Additionally, listeriosis does not typically cause a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels and other organs, including the brain. However, it is not typically associated with a history of travel to Brazil. Additionally, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis does not typically cause a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is an autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of the optic nerves and spinal cord. However, it is not typically associated with a history of travel to Brazil. Additionally, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder does not typically cause a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons.

He now presents with blurred vision and macular hemorrhage. The most likely diagnosis is cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. CMV retinitis is treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Acyclovir is not effective against CMV. Vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry may be useful to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not necessary for treatment. Azathioprine and infliximab are not effective against CMV.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Begin intravenous acyclovir: Acyclovir is a antiviral drug that is effective against herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus. It is not effective against CMV.
* B. Perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry: Vitreal sampling is a procedure in which a small sample of fluid is taken from the vitreous humor, the clear fluid that fills the eye. This fluid can be analyzed for the presence of CMV. However, vitreal sampling is not necessary for treatment of CMV retinitis.
* C. Begin intravenous ganciclovir: Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug that is effective against CMV. It is the first-line treatment for CMV retinitis.
* D. Begin azathioprine and infliximab: Azathioprine and infliximab are immunosuppressive drugs. They are not effective against CMV.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Begin intravenous ganciclovir. The patient has a history of HIV and lymphoma, and has recently undergone chemotherapy. He now presents with blurred vision and macular hemorrhage. The most likely diagnosis is CMV retinitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. CMV retinitis is treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Acyclovir, vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry, azathioprine, and infliximab are not effective against CMV.

 14%|█▍        | 213/1525 [53:02<4:48:04, 13.17s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

The patient has a history of breast cancer, and her MRI shows enlarged, morphologically abnormal lymph nodes in her right axilla. These findings are concerning for metastatic disease. A repeat MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination would not be helpful, as the lymph nodes may have already enlarged further by that time. A right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes, would allow for a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Performing an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy would not be necessary if the lymph nodes are already enlarged and suspicious for metastasis.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* **A. Perform repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination**

A repeat MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination would not be helpful, as the lymph nodes may have already enlarged further by that time. In addition, MRI is not a very sensitive test for lymph node metastasis, so it is possible that the lymph nodes would still appear normal even if they were metastatic.

* **B. Perform right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination**

A right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination would be more helpful than a repeat MRI, as ultrasound is a more sensitive test for lymph node metastasis. However, it is still possible that the lymph nodes would appear normal even if they were metastatic. In addition, waiting 4 to 6 weeks would delay diagnosis and treatment.

* **C. Perform an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time lumpectomy is performed**

Performing an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy would not be necessary if the lymph nodes are already enlarged and suspicious for metastasis. The axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy is a procedure used to determine if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit. It is typically performed after a lumpectomy to remove a cancerous tumor. If the axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy is positive for cancer, then the patient may need to have additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes. However, in this case, the lymph nodes are already enlarged and suspicious for metastasis, so an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy would not be necessary.

* **D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes**

Performing a right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes, would allow for a more timely diagnosis and treatment. If the lymph nodes are found to be metastatic, then the patient can start treatment immediately. In addition, early diagnosis and treatment of metastatic breast cancer can improve the patient's prognosis.

 14%|█▍        | 214/1525 [53:16<4:53:43, 13.44s/it]The correct answer is D. Stop voriconazole.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA), a condition that is characterized by the development of periostitis, osteosclerosis, and clubbing of the fingers and toes. HOA is a well-known side effect of voriconazole, and it is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.

A positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan is not necessary in this case, as it is not a sensitive or specific test for HOA. A bone biopsy is also not necessary, as the diagnosis of HOA can be made on clinical grounds. A parathyroidectomy is not indicated, as the patient does not have hyperparathyroidism.

The patient should stop taking voriconazole and be monitored for improvement of her symptoms. If her symptoms do not improve, she may need to be treated with other medications, such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid.

Here are some additional details about HOA:

* HOA is a non-inflammatory condition that is characterized by the development of periostitis, osteosclerosis, and clubbing of the fingers and toes.
* HOA is a well-known side effect of voriconazole, and it is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.
* The diagnosis of HOA can be made on clinical grounds, and a PET scan or bone biopsy is not necessary.
* Treatment of HOA involves stopping the offending medication and monitoring for improvement of symptoms. If symptoms do not improve, other medications, such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid, may be necessary.

The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a reversible neurological disorder that can occur in patients with a variety of underlying conditions, including leukemia. PRES is characterized by headache, seizures, and visual disturbances, including blurry vision. MRI of the brain and orbits is the most sensitive test for diagnosing PRES, and it can help to identify other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or a tumor.

Bilateral intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of neovascular age-related macular degeneration or other retinal vascular disease. Radiation therapy is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of cancer in the brain or orbits. Observation and reassurance are not appropriate in this patient because the patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious underlying condition.

In addition to MRI of the brain and orbits, the patient should also be evaluated for other potential causes of his blurry vision, such as a retinal detachment or a vitreous hemorrhage. The patient should also be started on treatment for his leukemia. The specific treatment for leukemia will depend on the type of leukemia that the patient has, as well as the stage of the disease.

 14%|█▍        | 216/1525 [53:45<4:59:32, 13.73s/it]The correct answer is B: Measure blood glucose levels. The patient has a history of dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus. The patient also reports feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache. These symptoms are consistent with diabetes mellitus. The Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly. This finding is consistent with a lesion in the left occipital cortex, which is a common site of infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus. The noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was normal, but the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex. This finding is also consistent with a lesion in the left occipital cortex. Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to measure blood glucose levels to rule out diabetes mellitus.

A: Measure C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These tests are used to assess inflammation. However, there is no evidence of inflammation in this patient. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an inflammatory condition, and the imaging studies are normal. Therefore, there is no need to measure C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

C: Perform lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid contents. This test is used to diagnose meningitis, encephalitis, and other central nervous system infections. However, there is no evidence of infection in this patient. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infection, and the imaging studies are normal. Therefore, there is no need to perform a lumbar puncture.

D: Perform magnetic resonance angiography of the head. This test is used to diagnose stroke. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a stroke. The patient's visual field defect is slowly progressive, which is not typical of stroke. In addition, the patient's imaging studies are normal. Therefore, there is no need to perform a magnetic resonance angiography of the head.

 14%|█▍        | 217/1525 [53:57<4:47:56, 13.21s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 2-month history of a tender mass on the lateral canthus of her right eye. The mass is subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible, and without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration. The rest of the ophthalmic and orbital examination is normal.

The differential diagnosis for a periorbital mass includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including:

* Benign lesions:
    * Warts
    * Sebaceous hyperplasia
    * Xanthelasma
    * Lipoma
    * Neurofibroma
    * Hemangioma
    * Lymphangioma
* Malignant lesions:
    * Basal cell carcinoma
    * Squamous cell carcinoma
    * Melanoma

The most important next step in the management of this patient is to perform an excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy. Excisional biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of periorbital masses. It allows for the complete removal of the lesion with a margin of normal tissue, which is necessary for accurate diagnosis and staging.

Trial of conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage is not appropriate in this patient because the lesion is concerning for malignancy. Conservative management may be appropriate for benign lesions, but it is not appropriate for malignant lesions.

Incision and drainage is not appropriate in this patient because the lesion is not fluctuant and there is no overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration. Incision and drainage is typically used for infected lesions, but it is not appropriate for non-infected lesions.

Observation is not appropriate in this patient because the lesion is concerning for malignancy. Observation may be appropriate for benign lesions, but it is not appropriate for malignant lesions.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Perform excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy.

 14%|█▍        | 218/1525 [54:07<4:28:19, 12.32s/it]The correct answer is A. Transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve for grading and immunohistochemistry.

The patient has a progressive optic neuropathy with a mass lesion involving the optic nerve and chiasm. The initial diagnosis of optic neuritis was not supported by the MRI findings, which showed a fusiform expansion of the right optic nerve and enhancement of the orbital, canalicular, and prechiasmatic segments of the right optic nerve, suggestive of an optic nerve glioma. The patient's visual acuity in the right eye has progressed to no light perception, and the lesion has continued to grow on repeated MRI.

The next step in management is to obtain a tissue diagnosis to confirm the diagnosis of optic nerve glioma and to determine the grade of the tumor. This information will be used to determine the best course of treatment. A transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve is the most appropriate procedure to obtain a tissue diagnosis. This procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and sedation, and it is associated with a low risk of complications.

Transcranial resection of the orbital, canalicular, and prechiasmatic optic nerve is not the best option at this time because the patient has already lost vision in the right eye. This procedure would not restore vision, and it would carry a significant risk of complications, including loss of vision in the left eye.

Chemotherapy and/or radiation for presumptive optic nerve glioma is not the best option at this time because the patient has not had a tissue diagnosis. Chemotherapy and radiation can be effective treatments for optic nerve glioma, but they are associated with significant side effects. It is important to know the grade of the tumor before starting treatment to avoid unnecessary treatment and to minimize the risk of side effects.

Observation given progression to no light perception vision is not the best option at this time because the patient has a progressive optic neuropathy with a mass lesion involving the optic nerve and chiasm. The patient's visual acuity in the right eye has progressed to no light perception, and the lesion has continued to grow on repeated MRI. Observation would not be appropriate in this case because the patient is at risk of further loss of vision and other complications.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve for grading and immunohistochemistry. This procedure will provide a tissue diagnosis that will be used to determine the best course of treatment.

This is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus that typically presents as a single, linear or annular lesion on the scalp. The lesion is often depressed and alopecic, with atrophic skin and telangiectasia. Histopathologic findings include a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with associated panniculitis. The condition is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, but it can also occur as an isolated cutaneous manifestation. Treatment is with systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is a rare, idiopathic disorder characterized by atrophic, linear bands of skin on the extremities. The lesions are often associated with hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia. Histopathologic findings include atrophic epidermis with loss of rete ridges and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis. The condition is not associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
* Linear discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by well-demarcated, scaly plaques on the face, scalp, and ears. The lesions are often associated with telangiectasia, atrophy, and scarring. Histopathologic findings include a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis with associated epidermal changes, such as basal cell vacuolar degeneration and follicular plugging. The condition is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
* Localized lipodystrophy is a rare disorder characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat in a localized area. The lesions are often asymmetric and can occur on any part of the body. Histopathologic findings include loss of adipocytes in the subcutis with associated fibrosis. The condition is not associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

 14%|█▍        | 220/1525 [54:40<5:14:01, 14.44s/it]The correct answer is C. Good syndrome. Good syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, polyarthritis, and skin lesions. It is associated with thymoma in about half of cases. The patient in the case presented with oral lichenoid lesions, a mediastinal mass, and hypogammaglobulinemia. The histopathologic features of the mediastinal mass were consistent with a type AB thymoma, Masaoka-Koga stage 2A. The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with Good syndrome, and the thymoma is a known association with this disorder. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is Good syndrome.

Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS) is a rare disorder that occurs in patients with cancer. It is characterized by the development of autoimmune diseases in multiple organs, including the skin, joints, lungs, kidneys, and heart. PAMS is thought to be caused by an immune reaction to cancer antigens that cross-react with self-antigens. The patient in the case does not have any evidence of cancer, so PAMS is not a likely diagnosis.

Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity (TAA) is a syndrome that occurs in patients with thymoma. It is characterized by the development of autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. TAA is thought to be caused by an immune reaction to thymoma antigens that cross-react with self-antigens. The patient in the case does not have any evidence of autoimmune disease, so TAA is not a likely diagnosis.

Paraneoplastic lichen planus is a rare disorder that occurs in patients with cancer. It is characterized by the development of lichen planus lesions, which are flat, purplish-red lesions that often have a lace-like appearance. Paraneoplastic lichen planus is thought to be caused by an immune reaction to cancer antigens that cross-react with self-antigens. The patient in the case does not have any evidence of cancer, so paraneoplastic lichen planus is not a likely diagnosis.

Catheterization on the left side of the heart and coronary angiogram is a invasive procedure that involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and threading it up to the heart. A dye is then injected through the catheter, which allows the doctor to see the blood vessels in the heart. This procedure is very accurate for diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate for diagnosing other causes of palpitations, such as arrhythmias. Additionally, catheterization is a more invasive procedure than MRI, and it carries a small risk of complications.

Dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a non-invasive procedure that involves having the patient exercise on a treadmill while an echocardiogram is performed. This procedure is useful for diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate for diagnosing other causes of palpitations, such as arrhythmias. Additionally, dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a more stressful procedure than MRI, and it can cause some patients to experience chest pain or shortness of breath.

Computed tomographic angiography of chest (CT angiography) is a non-invasive procedure that uses X-rays to create images of the blood vessels in the chest. This procedure is very accurate for diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as accurate for diagnosing other causes of palpitations, such as arrhythmias. Additionally, CT angiography is a more expensive procedure than MRI, and it exposes the patient to a small amount of radiation.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. MRI is the most accurate and safest procedure for diagnosing the cause of palpitations.

 15%|█▍        | 222/1525 [55:07<4:59:25, 13.79s/it]The correct answer is A. Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP).

MAP is a rare, autoimmune, paraneoplastic disorder characterized by the development of atrophic papules on the skin, which are often associated with underlying malignancy. The papules are typically hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, with a central umbilication. They may be accompanied by symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and sensory loss.

The diagnosis of MAP is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows atrophic epidermis with loss of rete pegs, and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis.

There is no specific treatment for MAP. Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying malignancy and relieving the symptoms of the skin lesions. Treatment options for the skin lesions include topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy.

The prognosis of MAP is variable. The disease can be fatal if the underlying malignancy is not treated. However, in some cases, the skin lesions may resolve spontaneously or with treatment.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Disseminated discoid lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin. The lesions of disseminated discoid lupus are typically red, scaly plaques. They are not associated with underlying malignancy.
* Scleromyxoedema is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin and other tissues. The lesions of scleromyxoedema are typically firm, waxy papules or plaques. They are not associated with underlying malignancy.
* Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The lesions of secondary syphilis are typically red, scaly macules or papules. They are not associated with underlying malignancy.

 15%|█▍        | 223/1525 [55:24<5:19:42, 14.73s/it]The correct answer is A. Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

ANCAs are antibodies that are directed against components of the cytoplasm of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. They are found in the blood of people with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

The patient in the case presented with a purpuric rash, foot paresthesias, and bilateral eye pain. These are all symptoms that can be seen in patients with GPA, MPA, or EGPA. In addition, the patient's biopsy showed a superficial perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils with leukocytoclasia, extravasation of erythrocytes, and fibrin in small blood vessel walls. This is a characteristic finding in patients with GPA, MPA, or EGPA.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to check ANCA titers. If the ANCA titers are positive, it would be consistent with a diagnosis of GPA, MPA, or EGPA. Further testing, such as a chest X-ray or a renal biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and stage the disease.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not specific for the patient's symptoms or findings. Chikungunya serology is used to diagnose chikungunya, a viral infection that can cause fever, rash, and joint pain. A transthoracic echocardiogram is used to evaluate the heart. A urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis is used to diagnose Chlamydia trachomatis, a sexually transmitted infection that can cause urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis.

 15%|█▍        | 224/1525 [55:37<5:08:15, 14.22s/it]The correct answer is C. Recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is a common virus that most people are exposed to at some point in their lives. It is usually spread through contact with saliva, such as through kissing or sharing a drink. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis typically include fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. The symptoms usually last for 4 to 6 weeks, but can sometimes last longer. There is no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis, but the symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers. In rare cases, infectious mononucleosis can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia, meningitis, or splenic rupture.

A rapid heterophile antibody test is a blood test that is used to screen for infectious mononucleosis. The test is usually positive in people with infectious mononucleosis, but it can also be positive in people with other infections, such as mononucleosis-like illnesses (MLIs). MLIs are caused by viruses other than EBV, and they have symptoms that are similar to those of infectious mononucleosis.

If the rapid heterophile antibody test is positive, the patient may need to have a more specific test, such as a monospot test, to confirm the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. The monospot test is more accurate than the rapid heterophile antibody test, but it is not always available.

If the patient is diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis, they will need to rest and avoid strenuous activity. They should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter pain relievers can be used to relieve fever and pain. In rare cases, hospitalization may be necessary if the patient has serious complications.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the best course of treatment for the patient's symptoms. Obtaining an ultrasound of the neck would not be helpful, because there is no evidence of a mass in the neck. Prescribing azithromycin would not be appropriate, because the patient does not have a bacterial infection. Treating with an oral antifungal medication would not be appropriate, because the patient does not have a fungal infection.

The patient is a 14-year-old boy with a history of atopic dermatitis who presents with ocular and periocular pain with photophobia in his right eye for the last 5 days. He has best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Slitlamp examination of the right eye shows conjunctival hyperemia and ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare 2+, and a few nongranulomatous keratic precipitates; the left anterior segment is quiet. Intraocular pressure is 15 mm Hg OU. Pupillary light responses are normal. Dilated fundus examination reveals 1+ of vitritis (binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score) in the right eye and swelling of the optic disc in both eyes, to a greater extent in the right eye. Routine blood tests, including full blood cell count, plasma glucose levels, liver function test, and kidney function test, were performed on the same day and showed a serum creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.0 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). Antibodies anti–Treponema pallidum were tested and the results were negative.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes anterior uveitis, optic neuritis, and retinal vasculitis. Anterior uveitis is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's history, presentation, and laboratory findings. Optic neuritis and retinal vasculitis are less likely, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test. This is because anterior uveitis can be a sign of systemic disease, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, sarcoidosis, or Behçet's disease. Urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's anterior uveitis.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Start treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics without further investigations. This is not the correct answer because it is important to identify the underlying cause of the patient's anterior uveitis before starting treatment.
* Option C: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This is not the correct answer because it is not necessary to order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits in all cases of anterior uveitis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits should be ordered only if there is a suspicion of a neurological or orbital abnormality.
* Option D: Observe. This is not the correct answer because it is important to identify the underlying cause of the patient's anterior uveitis before starting treatment.

The patient presents with sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia accompanied by left-sided upper eyelid ptosis. This is a concerning presentation, as it could be a sign of a number of serious neurological conditions, such as a stroke, a brain tumor, or a demyelinating disease.

A CT angiography of the head and neck would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. CT angiography is a good test for looking for blood clots in the blood vessels of the head and neck, but it is not as good at looking for other neurological problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.

A lumbar puncture to analyze the cellular composition of cerebrospinal fluid would also not be the most appropriate next step in this case. A lumbar puncture is a good test for looking for infection or inflammation in the central nervous system, but it is not as good at looking for other neurological problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.

The most appropriate next step in this case is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast. MRI is a very sensitive test that can be used to look for a wide variety of neurological problems, including strokes, brain tumors, and demyelinating diseases. In this case, the MRI would be able to show if there is any evidence of a stroke or a brain tumor, which would be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Order tests of inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and complete blood cell count is not the most appropriate next step in this case. These tests can be used to look for inflammation, but they are not as specific as MRI for looking for neurological problems. In this case, the MRI would be able to show if there is any evidence of a stroke or a brain tumor, which would be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient has a history of dry eye disease and well-controlled HIV. He also reports having unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners in the past few years. On examination, he has bilateral eye redness and pain, with diffuse scleral injection that does not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10%.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes infectious and autoimmune diseases, such as herpes simplex virus keratitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, sarcoidosis, and lupus. Laboratory tests can help to identify the specific cause of the patient's eye inflammation.

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral corticosteroids may be used to treat the symptoms of eye inflammation, but they do not address the underlying cause of the inflammation. Topical corticosteroids may also be used to treat eye inflammation, but they can have serious side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation.

Therefore, the best course of action for this patient is to order laboratory tests to rule out infectious and autoimmune diseases. Once the underlying cause of the patient's eye inflammation is identified, specific treatment can be initiated.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

A. Start oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID): NSAIDs are drugs that can be used to reduce pain and inflammation. They are often used to treat conditions such as arthritis, headaches, and muscle aches. However, NSAIDs are not effective against infectious or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, starting oral NSAIDs would not be the best course of action for this patient.

B. Start oral corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that can be used to reduce inflammation. They are often used to treat conditions such as asthma, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation. Therefore, starting oral corticosteroids would not be the best course of action for this patient.

C. Laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease: The best course of action for this patient is to order laboratory tests to rule out infectious and autoimmune diseases. These tests can help to identify the specific cause of the patient's eye inflammation. Once the underlying cause of the patient's eye inflammation is identified, specific treatment can be initiated.

D. Start topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are drugs that can be applied to the skin to reduce inflammation. They are often used to treat conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis. However, topical corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation. Therefore, starting topical corticosteroids would not be the best course of action for this patient.

The patient has a large cystic iris stromal lesion in the left eye that has suddenly enlarged. This is a potentially sight-threatening condition, as the cyst can block the drainage angle of the eye and cause glaucoma. YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall is a safe and effective procedure that can drain the cyst and reduce intraocular pressure.

Observation is not an appropriate option, as the patient is at risk of developing glaucoma. Biopsy is not necessary, as the diagnosis is already clear. Glaucoma tube surgery is not an appropriate option, as the patient does not have glaucoma.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each choice:

* A. YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall: This is a safe and effective procedure that can drain the cyst and reduce intraocular pressure. The laser is used to create a small hole in the wall of the cyst, which allows the fluid inside to drain out. This can relieve pressure on the optic nerve and prevent damage to the eye.
* B. Observation: This is not an appropriate option, as the patient is at risk of developing glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve, leading to loss of vision. If left untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness.
* C. Biopsy: This is not necessary, as the diagnosis is already clear. The patient has a cystic iris stromal lesion, which is a well-known condition. A biopsy would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient.
* D. Glaucoma tube surgery: This is not an appropriate option, as the patient does not have glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve, leading to loss of vision. If left untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of optic nerve damage, so glaucoma tube surgery would not be beneficial.

 15%|█▌        | 229/1525 [56:51<5:03:16, 14.04s/it]The correct answer is C. Review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids.

The patient has a history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. She is currently being treated with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin. These medications are known to cause ocular side effects, including uveitis and endophthalmitis.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with endophthalmitis. She has decreased vision in the left eye, conjunctival hyperemia, and a small hypopyon. The most likely cause of her endophthalmitis is her current medications.

The first step in treating endophthalmitis is to identify the causative organism. This can be done by obtaining a vitreous biopsy and culture. Once the organism has been identified, appropriate antibiotics can be started.

In the case of this patient, it is unlikely that the endophthalmitis is caused by a bacterial infection. The most likely cause is her current medications. Therefore, the first step in treatment is to review and adjust her systemic medications. It is possible that she can be switched to medications that are less likely to cause ocular side effects.

In addition to adjusting her systemic medications, the patient should also be treated with topical corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and protect the eye from further damage.

The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of progression of her endophthalmitis. If the infection does not respond to treatment, she may need to undergo a pars plana vitrectomy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, pars plana vitrectomy with hyperemia of intravitreal antibiotics, is not the first-line treatment for endophthalmitis. Vitrectomy is only indicated if the infection is unresponsive to medical therapy.
* Option B, treatment with topical and oral antibiotics, is also not the first-line treatment for endophthalmitis. Topical and oral antibiotics are only indicated if the infection is caused by a bacterial pathogen.
* Option D, treat with systemic and topical corticosteroids, is incorrect because the patient's endophthalmitis is most likely caused by her current medications. Corticosteroids can worsen the infection.

 15%|█▌        | 230/1525 [57:07<5:17:18, 14.70s/it]The correct answer is B. Calciphylaxis.

Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in small blood vessels, leading to tissue necrosis and gangrene. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic renal failure, but it can also occur in patients with other conditions, such as malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, and prolonged use of certain medications.

The patient in the case presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities, which progressed rapidly to skin necrosis. The physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities. A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis, which showed calcium deposits within the wall of a blood vessel in the subcutaneous tissue and pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like changes with fragmented calcified elastic fibers in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of calciphylaxis.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Type I cryoglobulinemia is a disorder characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins, which are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including purpura, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthralgias. However, it does not typically cause skin necrosis.

Cholesterol emboli are small pieces of cholesterol that break off from an atherosclerotic plaque and travel through the bloodstream, where they can lodge in small blood vessels and cause tissue damage. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain, and skin lesions. However, they do not typically cause skin necrosis.

Oxalate vasculopathy is a disorder characterized by the deposition of oxalate crystals in small blood vessels, leading to tissue necrosis and gangrene. It is most commonly seen in patients with primary hyperoxaluria, but it can also occur in patients with other conditions, such as renal failure and Crohn disease. The patient in the case did not have any of the risk factors for oxalate vasculopathy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Calciphylaxis. The patient's presentation, physical examination, and biopsy findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of calciphylaxis. The other answer choices are incorrect.

Kaposi sarcoma is a rare cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is most common in people with HIV/AIDS, but it can also occur in people who are not infected with HIV. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as purple or brown spots on the skin, but it can also affect the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and other organs.

Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the development of red or purple spots on the hands and feet. It is most common in people who live in tropical climates. Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is not a cancer, but it can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes or liver disease.

Lichen planus is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the development of flat, red or purple patches on the skin. It is most common in adults, but it can also occur in children. Lichen planus is not a cancer, but it can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as autoimmune disease.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of large, purple plaques on the left lower extremity that have been present for years. The lesions are asymptomatic with no associated pruritus, bleeding, or pain. No treatments or diagnostic workup had been attempted prior to presentation. The patient is otherwise healthy and was a never-smoker with no history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or HIV.

The physical examination revealed dark violaceous plaques, scattered subcutaneous nodules, and swelling to the mid-shin of the left lower extremity. There was mild warmth noted, but no palpable bruits. Complete metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, prothrombin, and serology were negative or within normal limits. A punch biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis, which showed proliferation of superficial and deep vessels, with thickening of the endothelium.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome. Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is a rare, non-neoplastic vascular disorder that is characterized by the development of violaceous plaques and nodules on the skin. It is most common in men in their 50s and 60s. The cause of Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be a disorder of the blood vessels. There is no cure for Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical steroids, laser therapy, and surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is most common in people with HIV/AIDS, but it can also occur in people who are not infected with HIV. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as purple or brown spots on the skin, but it can also affect the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and other organs. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the risk factors for Kaposi sarcoma, and his lesions are not typical of Kaposi sarcoma.

Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the development of red or purple spots on the hands and feet. It is most common in people who live in tropical climates. Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is not a cancer, but it can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes or liver disease.

 15%|█▌        | 232/1525 [57:34<5:07:45, 14.28s/it]The correct answer is B. Cutaneous aspergillosis.

Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer, AIDS, or organ transplants.

Cutaneous aspergillosis is a rare form of the infection that affects the skin. It is most commonly caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus can enter the skin through small cuts or abrasions, or through the respiratory tract.

The most common symptom of cutaneous aspergillosis is a single, painless nodule on the skin. The nodule may be red, swollen, and tender. It may also ulcerate and drain.

In some cases, cutaneous aspergillosis can spread to the bones, muscles, or other organs. This can lead to serious complications, such as osteomyelitis (infection of the bone), arthritis, or pneumonia.

Cutaneous aspergillosis is diagnosed with a biopsy of the affected skin. The biopsy is examined under a microscope to look for fungal hyphae (threads).

Cutaneous aspergillosis is treated with antifungal medications. The most common medication used is amphotericin B. Other medications that may be used include itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole.

The prognosis for cutaneous aspergillosis is good with treatment. However, the infection can be serious in people with weakened immune systems.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

A. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a type of infection that is caused by bacteria that are not tuberculosis. It can affect the lungs, skin, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in people with weakened immune systems.

The patient's symptoms do not suggest that he has a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The nodules on his cheek are not typical of this type of infection.

C. Phaeohyphomycosis is a type of fungal infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in people with weakened immune systems.

The patient's symptoms do not suggest that he has a phaeohyphomycosis. The nodules on his cheek are not typical of this type of infection.

D. Entomophthoromycosis is a type of fungal infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in people with weakened immune systems.

The patient's symptoms do not suggest that he has an entomophthoromycosis. The nodules on his cheek are not typical of this type of infection.

 15%|█▌        | 233/1525 [57:51<5:20:49, 14.90s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform an endomyocardial biopsy.

The patient in the case presented with a history of Burkitt lymphoma, which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is a network of organs and tissues that helps the body fight infection. The lymphatic system includes the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and bone marrow.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a recurrence of her lymphoma. The dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope are all symptoms that can be caused by lymphoma. The laboratory findings of a high white blood cell count and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are also consistent with lymphoma.

The transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

The findings on the imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. The endomyocardial biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose lymphoma. The biopsy is performed by inserting a needle through the chest wall into the heart and taking a small piece of tissue from the heart muscle. The tissue is then examined under a microscope to look for cancerous cells.

The other options are not the correct answers because they do not provide the most accurate diagnosis or treatment for the patient's condition.

Option A, Perform a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass, is not the correct answer because the hilar mass is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The hilar mass is more likely to be a benign condition, such as a granuloma or a lymph node.

Option B, Perform an urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac mass, is not the correct answer because the intracardiac mass is not causing any symptoms and does not appear to be life-threatening. Surgical resection of the intracardiac mass would be a high-risk procedure with a significant risk of complications.

Option C, Refer to an oncologist for further chemotherapy, is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a recurrence of her lymphoma. Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is not the best treatment for a benign condition, such as a granuloma or a lymph node.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform an endomyocardial biopsy.

 15%|█▌        | 234/1525 [58:07<5:30:00, 15.34s/it]The correct answer is A: Place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The most common symptoms of TB are cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. TB can also cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

The chest radiograph and chest CT scan show a 3.2 × 2.6–cm dense consolidation in the left lower lobe. This is a characteristic finding of TB. The MRI of the spine shows signal abnormality and extensive contrast enhancement within the T6, T7, and T8 vertebral bodies, with sparing of the T6-7 and T7-8 disks. This finding is also consistent with TB.

The patient should be placed in airborne isolation to prevent the spread of TB to others. Airborne isolation means that the patient is placed in a private room with negative pressure ventilation. The patient should also wear a mask when they leave their room.

The patient should be started on a four-drug regimen of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. This is the standard treatment for TB. The patient should continue to take this medication for at least six months.

The patient should also be evaluated for HIV infection. HIV is a virus that can weaken the immune system, making it more difficult to fight off TB. If the patient is HIV-positive, they will need to take additional medications to treat their HIV infection.

The patient should be monitored for the development of complications of TB. These complications can include meningitis, spinal cord compression, and disseminated TB.

The patient should be educated about TB and the importance of taking their medication as prescribed. They should also be told to avoid contact with people who are sick, to get plenty of rest, and to eat a healthy diet.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not treat TB.

B: Measure prostate-specific antigen level is incorrect because prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the prostate gland. It is used to screen for prostate cancer, but it is not used to diagnose or treat TB.

C: Start cefepime and vancomycin is incorrect because cefepime and vancomycin are antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial infections. They are not effective against TB.

D: Start doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin is incorrect because doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin are antibiotics that are used to treat a variety of infections, including TB. However, they are not the preferred treatment for TB.

 15%|█▌        | 235/1525 [58:24<5:38:34, 15.75s/it]The correct answer is A: Results are consistent with axonal polyneuropathy.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a polyneuropathy, which is a disorder of the peripheral nerves. The patient has progressive lower extremity pain and gait imbalance, which are common symptoms of polyneuropathy. The neurological examination showed reduced pinprick sensation in both feet and absent vibratory sensation at the first toes, which are also common findings in polyneuropathy. The patient had a slightly wide-based gait, high-arched feet, and hammer toes, which are all characteristic of Charcot foot, a complication of polyneuropathy. The patient had no known family history of polyneuropathy and no history of diabetes, alcohol misuse, known vitamin deficiency, hypothyroidism, or HIV, which are all common causes of polyneuropathy.

The nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) results are also consistent with an axonal polyneuropathy. The NCS showed slowed nerve conduction velocities and prolonged distal latencies, which are characteristic of axonal polyneuropathy. The EMG showed decreased recruitment of motor units, which is also a characteristic finding of axonal polyneuropathy.

Therefore, the results of the history, examination, NCS, and EMG are all consistent with an axonal polyneuropathy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B: Results are consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy. This is incorrect because the patient's history, examination, NCS, and EMG are not consistent with a demyelinating polyneuropathy. Demyelinating polyneuropathies are typically caused by diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or multiple sclerosis. These diseases are characterized by rapidly progressive weakness and sensory loss, which are not present in this patient. Additionally, the NCS in demyelinating polyneuropathies typically show conduction block and slowing of nerve conduction velocities, which are not present in this patient.
* C: Results are consistent with polyradiculopathy. This is incorrect because the patient's history, examination, NCS, and EMG are not consistent with a polyradiculopathy. Polyradiculopathies are typically caused by diseases such as Lyme disease or HIV infection. These diseases are characterized by pain and weakness in the arms and legs, which are not present in this patient. Additionally, the NCS in polyradiculopathies typically show decreased compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) in the arms and legs, which are not present in this patient.
* D: Results are normal. This is incorrect because the patient's history, examination, NCS, and EMG are not normal. The patient has a history and examination consistent with a polyneuropathy, and the NCS and EMG show findings consistent with an axonal polyneuropathy. Therefore, the results are not normal.

Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is also used to treat acne and rosacea. Minocycline can cause a number of side effects, including blue-black skin pigmentation. This side effect is more common in people with dark skin. It is usually reversible when the medication is stopped.

In this case, the patient has a 1-month history of progressive skin discoloration. He has been taking minocycline for the past 6 months. His arms have been purple and bruise-like for several years but turned a near black color 1 month ago. He has no history of malnutrition and reported infrequent alcohol use.

The physical examination showed dense blue-black skin pigmentation of his forearms, dorsal hands, legs, and dorsal feet, as well as blue discoloration of his sclerae and teeth. He had normal-colored nails and oral mucosa. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 15 800/μL (reference range, 4000-11 000/μL), hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelet count of 58 000/μL (reference, 150 000-400 000/μL), and INR of 1.8 (reference, 0.8-1.1). Complete metabolic panel showed increased creatinine (1.51 mg/dL; reference, 0.64-1.27 mg/dL) and elevated total bilirubin (1.7 mg/dL; reference range, 0.3-1.2 mg/dL). His estimated glomerular filtration rate was 40 mL/min/1.73 m2.

The most likely diagnosis is minocycline-induced pigmentation. The patient should be advised to discontinue minocycline. The pigmentation will usually resolve within a few weeks of stopping the medication.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Apixaban is a blood thinner that is used to prevent blood clots. It is not the cause of the patient's skin discoloration.
* Serum iron studies are used to evaluate iron levels in the blood. They are not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of iron deficiency.
* Serum niacin levels are used to evaluate niacin levels in the blood. They are not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of niacin deficiency.

The patient in the case has a recalcitrant central corneal ulcer in her left eye. She has a history of daily soft contact lens wear, and had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. These risk factors suggest that the ulcer may be caused by a fungal infection.

The IVCM images show a stromal infiltrate with a hyporeflective center and a hyperreflective halo. This appearance is consistent with a fungal infection.

Vancomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against bacteria, but not against fungi. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against yeasts, but not against molds. Polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate are antiseptics that are effective against bacteria and some fungi, but not against molds.

Voriconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against a wide range of fungi, including molds. It is the most appropriate choice of medication for empirical treatment of a fungal corneal ulcer in a patient with risk factors for fungal infection.

Here are additional details on each of the answer choices:

* Vancomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and some anaerobic bacteria. It is not effective against fungi.
* Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against yeasts, including Candida albicans. It is not effective against molds.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the center of the eye. This procedure is typically used to treat a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, macular holes, and vitreous hemorrhage. However, it is not typically used to treat macular schisis, as this condition is usually not severe enough to warrant surgery.

Laser barricade is a procedure that involves using a laser to create a barrier between the two layers of the retina that are separated in macular schisis. This procedure can help to prevent the separation from progressing, but it does not usually improve vision.

Genetic testing for the RS1 gene is not typically necessary to diagnose or treat macular schisis. The RS1 gene is associated with a rare form of macular schisis, but this form is usually not severe enough to require treatment.

Therefore, the best course of action in this case is to observe the patient and monitor her vision. If her vision worsens, then further treatment may be necessary.

The patient has bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and headache. These are all symptoms that can be caused by mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders that affect the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing cells in the body. They can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss, hearing loss, headache, and seizures.

Genetic testing is the best way to diagnose a mitochondrial disease. This type of testing can identify mutations in the genes that cause mitochondrial diseases. If the patient is found to have a mitochondrial disease, there is no cure, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the patient's specific symptoms. Laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation would be appropriate if the patient had other symptoms of inflammation, such as redness and pain in the eye. Genetic testing to rule out pattern dystrophy or Stargardt disease would be appropriate if the patient had other symptoms of these conditions, such as decreased vision and changes in the appearance of the retina.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease. This is the best way to diagnose the patient's condition and to provide her with the best possible care.

The patient presented with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye. CRVO is a common retinal vascular disorder that occurs when the central retinal vein, which carries blood from the retina to the optic nerve, becomes blocked. This can lead to swelling of the optic disc, retinal hemorrhages, and vision loss.

In the case presented, the patient's vision loss was sudden and bilateral, which is concerning for a more serious underlying condition. The patient also has a history of dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

A thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to assess the structures in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. It can be used to detect a variety of conditions, including blood clots, tumors, and aortic aneurysms.

In this case, a thoracoabdominopelvic CT scan is indicated to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing the patient's vision loss. If a blood clot is found, it can be treated with medication or surgery. If a tumor is found, it can be treated with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. And if an aortic aneurysm is found, it can be treated with surgery or medication.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Initiate panretinal photocoagulation is not indicated in this case because the patient has bilateral nonischemic CRVO. Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for ischemic CRVO, which is a more serious type of CRVO that can lead to permanent vision loss.
* C: Follow-up without further intervention is not an appropriate management strategy for a patient with bilateral nonischemic CRVO. The patient needs to be evaluated to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing the vision loss.
* D: Initiate acetylsalicylic acid and no further intervention is not an appropriate management strategy for a patient with bilateral nonischemic CRVO. Acetylsalicylic acid is a blood thinner that can be used to prevent blood clots. However, it is not a treatment for CRVO.

The patient's history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma is significant because it is a genetic disorder that predisposes to the development of other cancers, including soft tissue sarcomas. The patient's presentation with unilateral leg swelling is also concerning for a soft tissue sarcoma, as this is a common symptom of these tumors.

The physical examination findings are also consistent with a soft tissue sarcoma. The patient has firm, nonpitting edema to the hip, which is a characteristic finding of these tumors. The patient does not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses, which makes other diagnoses less likely.

The laboratory work results are unremarkable, which does not provide any clues to the diagnosis. The Doppler ultrasonography of the right lower extremity shows no deep vein thrombosis, which makes a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism less likely.

The computed tomography venogram demonstrates a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that is extending into the right common iliac vein. This finding is highly suggestive of a soft tissue sarcoma, such as leiomyosarcoma.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination findings, laboratory work results, and imaging studies are all consistent with a diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The other answer choices are less likely based on the available information.

The following are the reasons why the other answer choices are incorrect:

* Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is most commonly found in the extremities. However, it is not typically associated with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma.
* Angiosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is most commonly found in the skin. It is not typically associated with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma.

A branchial cleft cyst is a developmental anomaly that occurs when one of the branchial arches fails to close completely. This can result in a cyst that contains mucus or fluid. Branchial cleft cysts are most common in children and young adults, and they typically occur in the neck, near the angle of the jaw. The most common symptom of a branchial cleft cyst is a painless swelling in the neck. The cyst may also cause pain, infection, or difficulty swallowing. Treatment for a branchial cleft cyst typically involves surgical removal.

A thyroglossal duct cyst is a developmental anomaly that occurs when the thyroglossal duct fails to disappear completely during fetal development. This can result in a cyst that contains mucus or fluid. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common in children, but they can occur in adults as well. The most common symptom of a thyroglossal duct cyst is a painless swelling in the midline of the neck, near the base of the tongue. The cyst may also cause pain, infection, or difficulty swallowing. Treatment for a thyroglossal duct cyst typically involves surgical removal.

A parathyroid cyst is a rare condition that occurs when one of the parathyroid glands becomes enlarged and filled with fluid. Parathyroid glands are small, pea-sized glands that are located in the neck, near the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, a hormone that helps to regulate blood calcium levels. Parathyroid cysts are most common in women, and they typically occur in people who are over the age of 50. The most common symptom of a parathyroid cyst is a painless swelling in the neck. The cyst may also cause pain, infection, or difficulty swallowing. Treatment for a parathyroid cyst typically involves surgical removal.

A cystic thyroid nodule is a growth on the thyroid gland that is filled with fluid. Thyroid nodules are common, and they can occur in people of any age. Most thyroid nodules are benign (noncancerous), but some can be cancerous. The most common symptom of a thyroid nodule is a lump in the neck. The nodule may also cause pain, difficulty swallowing, or hoarseness. Treatment for a thyroid nodule depends on the size, type, and location of the nodule. Some thyroid nodules may be monitored with regular exams, while others may need to be removed surgically.

In the case of the 44-year-old woman, the most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid cyst. The patient's history of a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms, her physical examination findings, and the results of her imaging studies and laboratory tests are all consistent with a parathyroid cyst. The patient's parathyroid hormone level was elevated, which is a characteristic finding in patients with parathyroid cysts. The patient's barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus, which makes it unlikely that the cyst is a branchial cleft cyst or a thyroglossal duct cyst. The patient's cystic thyroid nodule was not associated with any symptoms, and her thyroid stimulating hormone level was normal, which makes it unlikely that the cyst is a cystic thyroid nodule.

 16%|█▌        | 243/1525 [1:00:13<5:23:44, 15.15s/it]The correct answer is C. Growing teratoma syndrome.

Latent metastasis from the NSGCT is incorrect because the patient's neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment. This suggests that the mass is not a metastasis, but rather a new tumor that is growing.

Supraclavicular lymphocele is incorrect because the patient's neck mass is cystic, which is not typical of a lymphocele. Lymphoceles are usually fluid-filled sacs that form after lymph nodes are removed or damaged.

Benign teratoma is incorrect because the patient's neck mass is growing and is not responding to chemotherapy. Benign teratomas are usually slow-growing tumors that do not require treatment.

Growing teratoma syndrome is a rare condition that occurs in patients who have been treated for testicular cancer. In this condition, the tumor cells that were left behind after treatment can grow and form a new tumor. This new tumor can be malignant or benign.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely diagnosis is growing teratoma syndrome. The patient has a history of testicular cancer, and his neck mass is cystic and growing. The mass is also not responding to chemotherapy, which is another characteristic of growing teratoma syndrome.

The treatment for growing teratoma syndrome depends on whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Malignant tumors are usually treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Benign tumors may be treated with surgery alone.

The prognosis for patients with growing teratoma syndrome depends on the type of tumor and the stage of the disease. Patients with malignant tumors have a poorer prognosis than patients with benign tumors.

 16%|█▌        | 244/1525 [1:00:27<5:13:56, 14.70s/it]The correct answer is C. Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is the most common type of laryngeal cancer, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient has a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and he has been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma (EMMS) is a rare malignancy that arises from myeloid stem cells and can occur in patients with a history of hematologic malignancies, such as AML. EMMS is often associated with GVHD, and it can present with hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea, as in this case.

Graft-vs-host disease of the larynx is a possible diagnosis in this case, but it is less likely than EMMS. The patient has a history of chronic GVHD, but he does not have any other typical features of GVHD of the larynx, such as erythema, edema, and ulceration.

Marginal zone lymphoma of the larynx is a rare type of lymphoma that can occur in the larynx. It is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient does not have any other typical features of lymphoma, such as lymphadenopathy, fever, or night sweats.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is C. Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of AML, his history of GVHD, and the clinical presentation of hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea.

The patient's history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma is a strong clue to the diagnosis. This type of lymphoma is often associated with skin lesions, which can be widespread and atypical. The patient's current rash is consistent with this type of lymphoma, as it is widespread, nontender, erythematous, and has prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation. The punch biopsy of a representative lesion shows intravascular atypical cells, which is a classic finding in NK/T-cell lymphoma.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Malignant neoplasm–associated microscopic polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can involve the skin. However, it is not associated with intravascular involvement by atypical cells.
* Cutaneous coccidiomycosis is a fungal infection of the skin. It is not associated with intravascular involvement by atypical cells.
* Erythema nodosum is a non-specific inflammatory condition of the skin that can be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain medications. It is not associated with intravascular involvement by atypical cells.

 16%|█▌        | 246/1525 [1:00:58<5:23:41, 15.19s/it]The correct answer is C: Change the LV pacing configuration.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with biventricular pacing failure. Biventricular pacing is a treatment for heart failure that involves pacing both the right and left ventricles. It is thought to improve cardiac function by synchronizing the contraction of the two ventricles.

In this case, the patient's ejection fraction has decreased despite being on biventricular pacing. This suggests that the current pacing configuration is not providing optimal benefit. One possible explanation for this is that the LV pacing vector is not optimally positioned. The LV pacing vector is the electrical signal that is delivered to the left ventricle to cause it to contract. If the LV pacing vector is not optimally positioned, it may not be able to stimulate the left ventricle effectively.

Changing the LV pacing configuration may improve the patient's condition by allowing for more effective stimulation of the left ventricle. This could improve cardiac function and reduce the patient's risk of death.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Suppressing the premature ventricular contractions is not necessary in this case. The patient's premature ventricular contractions are not causing any symptoms and are not associated with an increased risk of death.
* Option B: Increasing the basal pacing rate is not likely to improve the patient's condition. The patient's ejection fraction has decreased despite being on biventricular pacing at a high basal pacing rate. Increasing the basal pacing rate is not likely to improve cardiac function.
* Option D: Referring for LV lead repositioning is not necessary in this case. The patient's pacemaker lead position is unchanged from implantation. There is no reason to believe that the lead position has changed and is causing the patient's symptoms.

The patient has multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face that have developed over the past 3 months. He also experiences a burning sensation on the right side of his face. The ulcers are limited to the right half of the face and are associated with hypoesthesia of the right side of the face. The patient has no headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and no visual disturbance.

The patient's history is consistent with trigeminal trophic syndrome. Trigeminal trophic syndrome is a rare disorder that is characterized by progressive ulceration of the skin and underlying tissues in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The disorder is most often seen in patients who have had a stroke or other neurological injury that affects the trigeminal nerve. The exact cause of trigeminal trophic syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including damage to the trigeminal nerve, impaired blood flow to the skin, and abnormal nerve function.

The diagnosis of trigeminal trophic syndrome is based on the patient's history and physical examination. There is no specific test for the disorder. Treatment of trigeminal trophic syndrome is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing further damage to the skin. Treatment may include medication, such as steroids, antibiotics, and pain medication. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected skin and tissue.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Giant cell arteritis is a rare inflammatory disease of the arteries that can cause headache, fever, and jaw pain. It is not associated with facial ulcers.
* Trigeminal herpes zoster is a viral infection of the trigeminal nerve that can cause facial pain and blisters. It is not associated with progressive ulceration of the skin.
* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare skin condition that can cause painful ulcers. It is not associated with facial ulcers.

 16%|█▋        | 248/1525 [1:01:21<4:37:28, 13.04s/it]The correct answer is D. Check antiphospholipid antibody levels.

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. These are all risk factors for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause blood clots to form in the small blood vessels of the body. APS can cause a variety of symptoms, including retinal artery thrombosis, aortic valve vegetations, and stroke.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with APS, and her laboratory testing is suggestive of the disorder. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are often positive in APS, but they are not specific for the disorder. DsDNA antibodies are more specific for APS, and the patient's dsDNA antibody level is elevated.

The next step in the management of this patient is to check her antiphospholipid antibody levels. If the levels are positive, she will need to be treated with anticoagulant therapy to prevent blood clots from forming.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Administering intravenous antibiotics would not be helpful because the patient does not have an infection. Administering systemic corticosteroids would not be helpful because APS is not an inflammatory disorder. Administering anticoagulant therapy would be helpful if the patient has a blood clot, but it would not address the underlying cause of the blood clot.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Check antiphospholipid antibody levels.

 16%|█▋        | 249/1525 [1:01:34<4:37:13, 13.04s/it]The correct answer is D. Ice pack test.

The ice pack test is a simple, non-invasive test that can be used to diagnose a third nerve palsy. The test is performed by applying an ice pack to the affected eye for 5 minutes. If the double vision improves after the ice pack is applied, it is likely that the third nerve is involved.

Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests are not specific for third nerve palsy and are not necessary in the initial evaluation of this condition. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head may be helpful in the diagnosis of third nerve palsy if there is a suspicion of a mass lesion or other underlying cause, such as a stroke. However, these tests are not necessary in the majority of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast is not necessary in the initial evaluation of third nerve palsy. This test is only indicated if there is a suspicion of a mass lesion or other underlying cause, such as a tumor, in the orbit.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests are not specific for third nerve palsy and are not necessary in the initial evaluation of this condition.
* B. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head may be helpful in the diagnosis of third nerve palsy if there is a suspicion of a mass lesion or other underlying cause, such as a stroke. However, these tests are not necessary in the majority of cases.

 16%|█▋        | 250/1525 [1:01:48<4:44:26, 13.39s/it]The correct answer is B. Repeated lumbar puncture with serologies.

The patient has bilateral optic nerve edema, an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture, and a normal brain MRI. These findings are consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion, so it is important to rule out other causes of optic nerve edema, such as multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and compressive optic neuropathy.

The patient's history of hypertension is a risk factor for IIH. Other risk factors include obesity, use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy.

The treatment for IIH is to reduce the intracranial pressure. This can be done with acetazolamide, a medication that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, or with a lumbar puncture to drain cerebrospinal fluid. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to create a shunt to drain cerebrospinal fluid.

The patient in the case report has been treated with acetazolamide, but his vision has not improved. He is now due for a follow-up visit with his doctor. At this visit, the doctor will likely order a repeated lumbar puncture to measure the intracranial pressure and to check for signs of infection. The doctor may also order serologies to test for autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's optic nerve edema.

* Option A, advising tighter blood pressure control, would be appropriate if the patient's optic nerve edema was caused by hypertension. However, the patient's history of hypertension is only a risk factor for IIH, and there is no evidence that his hypertension is causing his optic nerve edema.
* Option C, starting high-dose corticosteroids, would be appropriate if the patient's optic nerve edema was caused by an autoimmune disease. However, there is no evidence that the patient has an autoimmune disease.
* Option D, continuing acetazolamide and repeated Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months, would be appropriate if the patient's optic nerve edema was responding to treatment with acetazolamide. However, the patient's vision has not improved with treatment, so it is likely that he has a different condition, such as IIH.

The patient in this case has a number of concerning features, including:

* Severe headaches
* Progressive blurred vision
* Bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole
* Focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause sudden and severe vision loss. The mainstay of treatment for APMPPE is high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. This treatment is typically given for 3 days, followed by a taper over 2-4 weeks.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and progressive, and there is a risk of permanent vision loss if treatment is not initiated promptly. Therefore, the patient should be sent to the emergency department for admission and initiation of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Send for infectious and inflammatory tests and follow up within 1 week. This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are severe and progressive, and there is a risk of permanent vision loss if treatment is not initiated promptly.
* Option B: Send for infectious and inflammatory tests, begin oral prednisone therapy, and follow up in 1 week. This option is incorrect because oral prednisone is not as effective as intravenous methylprednisolone in the treatment of APMPPE.
* Option D: Refer for outpatient neurologic evaluation. This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are severe and progressive, and they require urgent treatment.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a sudden loss of kidney function caused by damage to the kidney tubules. This damage can be caused by a variety of factors, including:

* Dehydration
* Blood loss
* Shock
* Kidney stones
* Medications
* Toxins
* Infections

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely cause of ATN is kidney melanoma metastasis. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can spread to the kidneys. When melanoma cells spread to the kidneys, they can damage the kidney tubules, leading to ATN.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis is a type of kidney injury that can be caused by immunotherapy drugs. However, there is no evidence that the patient in the question was taking any immunotherapy drugs.
* Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney inflammation that can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection. However, there is no evidence that the patient in the question had a recent infection.
* Drug-induced acute tubular necrosis is a type of kidney injury that can be caused by certain medications. However, there is no evidence that the patient in the question was taking any medications that could have caused ATN.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis. The other answer choices are incorrect for the reasons stated above.

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes. He presents with 6 weeks' history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. He also complains of nasal regurgitation. He denies having any systemic symptoms. He takes linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. He is a nonsmoker and consumes very little alcohol.

Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean. There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal.

Results of laboratory investigations, including lactate dehydrogenase level and autoimmune antibody tests, such as antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, were negative. Screening test results for HIV and Treponema pallidum were also negative. The only positive result was immunoglobulin (Ig) G for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The IgM for EBV was not detected.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck on short tau inversion recovery sequence confirmed the soft palate defect but also showed some thickening and hyperenhancement around the edges of the defect. There was no demonstrable nasopharyngeal mass. The hard palate was intact, and there were no significant cervical lymph nodes. The patient had biopsies taken from the ulcers and edges of the soft palate defect.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsies showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. There was also evidence of epithelial ulceration and necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for EBV in the lymphocytes.

Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer. EBV is a herpesvirus that is associated with a number of diseases, including infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers are a rare manifestation of EBV infection. They typically occur in children and young adults and are characterized by painful ulcers that can occur anywhere on the skin or mucous membranes. The ulcers are usually self-limited, but they can sometimes be recurrent.

The treatment of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers is generally supportive. Treatment may include pain medication, topical steroids, and/or antiviral therapy. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are nasopharyngeal carcinoma, autoimmune vasculitis, and squamous cell carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare cancer that originates in the nasopharynx. It is more common in people of Chinese, Southeast Asian, and African descent. The most common symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and hearing loss. The diagnosis is made with biopsy. Treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma usually involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Autoimmune vasculitis is a group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. The most common symptoms of autoimmune vasculitis are fever, rash, and joint pain. The diagnosis is made with blood tests and imaging studies. Treatment of autoimmune vasculitis usually involves a combination of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and/or plasmapheresis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the body. It is the most common type of skin cancer. The most common symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma are a sore that does not heal, a change in the appearance of a mole, and a lump or bump on the skin. The diagnosis is made with biopsy. Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma usually involves surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer. The other possible diagnoses are nasopharyngeal carcinoma, autoimmune vasculitis, and squamous cell carcinoma.

A papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a type of thyroid cancer that is characterized by the presence of papillary structures in the thyroid gland. PTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of all thyroid cancers. The average age of diagnosis for PTC is 40 years old, and women are more likely to be affected than men.

The clinical presentation of PTC can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some patients may present with a painless neck mass, while others may have symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or neck pain. PTC is often diagnosed on the basis of a thyroid ultrasound, which can show a hypoechoic nodule (a nodule that is less echogenic than the surrounding tissue). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis of PTC.

The treatment of PTC depends on the size and stage of the tumor. Small, low-grade tumors may be treated with surgery alone. Larger tumors or tumors with regional lymph node involvement may require surgery followed by radioactive iodine therapy. In some cases, chemotherapy may also be used.

The prognosis for PTC is generally good. With appropriate treatment, the cure rate for PTC is high. However, PTC can recur, and patients should be monitored closely for signs of recurrence.

A medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare type of thyroid cancer that arises from the calcitonin-producing C cells of the thyroid gland. MTC is associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and MEN 2B syndromes. The average age of diagnosis for MTC is 30 years old, and men are more likely to be affected than women.

The clinical presentation of MTC can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some patients may present with a painless neck mass, while others may have symptoms such as diarrhea, flushing, and sweating. MTC is often diagnosed on the basis of a thyroid ultrasound, which can show a hypoechoic nodule (a nodule that is less echogenic than the surrounding tissue). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis of MTC.

The treatment of MTC depends on the size and stage of the tumor. Small, low-grade tumors may be treated with surgery alone. Larger tumors or tumors with regional lymph node involvement may require surgery followed by radioactive iodine therapy or chemotherapy. In some cases, targeted therapy may also be used.

The prognosis for MTC is generally good. With appropriate treatment, the cure rate for MTC is high. However, MTC can recur, and patients should be monitored closely for signs of recurrence.

A hyalinizing trabecular tumor (HTT) is a rare type of thyroid tumor that is characterized by the presence of hyalinized trabeculae (fibrous bands) and spindle cells. HTT is usually a benign tumor, but it can occasionally be malignant. The average age of diagnosis for HTT is 40 years old, and women are more likely to be affected than men.

The clinical presentation of HTT can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some patients may present with a painless neck mass, while others may have symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or neck pain. HTT is often diagnosed on the basis of a thyroid ultrasound, which can show a hypoechoic nodule (a nodule that is less echogenic than the surrounding tissue). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis of HTT.

The treatment of HTT depends on the size and stage of the tumor. Small, benign tumors may be treated with surgery alone. Larger tumors or tumors with regional lymph node involvement may require surgery followed by radioactive iodine therapy or chemotherapy. In some cases, targeted therapy may also be used.

The prognosis for HTT is generally good. With appropriate treatment, the cure rate for HTT is high. However, HTT can recur, and patients should be monitored closely for signs of recurrence.

A thyroid paraganglioma is a rare type of tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small collections of cells that are located throughout the body, including the neck. Paragangliomas are usually benign, but they can occasionally be malignant. The average age of diagnosis for a thyroid paraganglioma is 50 years old, and men are more likely to be affected than women.

The clinical presentation of a thyroid paraganglioma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some patients may present with a painless neck mass, while others may have symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or neck pain.

Blau syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by ichthyosiform rash, joint pain, uveitis, and other systemic manifestations. It is caused by mutations in the HADHA gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

The patient in the case report presented with generalized erythematous rashes, joint pain, uveitis, and a skin biopsy that showed multiple circumscribed nests of granulomas that were infiltrating the dermis and subcutis. These findings are consistent with Blau syndrome.

Ichthyosis vulgaris is a common, genetic disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin. It is caused by mutations in the ABCA12 gene, which encodes a protein involved in lipid transport. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The patient in the case report did not have any of the characteristic features of ichthyosis vulgaris, such as fine, white scales on the extensor surfaces of the extremities.

Netherton syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by ichthyosiform rash, hair loss, and atopic dermatitis. It is caused by mutations in the SPINK5 gene, which encodes a protein involved in epidermal barrier function. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The patient in the case report did not have any of the characteristic features of Netherton syndrome, such as hair loss or atopic dermatitis.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a common, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by scaling, erythema, and follicular plugging. It is not a genetic disorder. The patient in the case report did not have any of the characteristic features of pityriasis rubra pilaris, such as the salmon-colored scaling on the palms and soles.

In conclusion, the correct answer is Blau syndrome.

The patient has a history of exertional dyspnea, dizziness, and elevated troponin levels. Her electrocardiogram shows diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide, creatinine phosphokinase, and D-dimer. Echocardiography showed left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass. Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, particularly the apex. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography.

The treatment of HCM is aimed at reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death. This includes beta-blockers, such as bisoprolol, to slow the heart rate and reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Other medications, such as calcium channel blockers and diuretics, may also be used. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to reduce the size of the left ventricle or to implant an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Administer dobutamine is not appropriate for the patient because it would increase the heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand.
* Administer nitrates and nifedipine are not appropriate for the patient because they would reduce the blood pressure and could precipitate hypotension.
* Start an intra-aortic balloon pump is not appropriate for the patient because it would not improve the patient's condition.

 17%|█▋        | 258/1525 [1:03:41<4:11:23, 11.91s/it]The correct answer is D. Begin valganciclovir therapy and sample intraocular fluid for polymerase chain reaction testing.

The patient has a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. Optical coherence tomography of the macula showed atrophy, full-thickness hyperreflectivity, and a residual epiretinal membrane. These findings are consistent with CMV retinitis, a viral infection of the retina that is a common complication of immunosuppression.

CMV retinitis is typically treated with ganciclovir, a antiviral medication. Intravitreal ganciclovir is the preferred treatment for CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS. Oral ganciclovir is an alternative treatment option for patients who are not eligible for intravitreal injections.

In addition to ganciclovir therapy, it is important to sample intraocular fluid for polymerase chain reaction testing to confirm the diagnosis of CMV retinitis. This will help to ensure that the patient is receiving the appropriate treatment.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Perform vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics is incorrect because the patient does not have a bacterial infection.
* Option B: Review medical records to see if gentamicin was given intraoperatively is incorrect because gentamicin is not a drug that is used to treat CMV retinitis.
* Option C: Urgently refer patient to emergency department for embolic stroke workup is incorrect because the patient does not have an embolic stroke.

 17%|█▋        | 259/1525 [1:03:58<4:41:18, 13.33s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram (AS-OCT). The other choices are incorrect because they are either too aggressive or too conservative.

A penetrating keratoplasty (PK) is a surgical procedure to remove a diseased cornea and replace it with a donor cornea. It is a major surgery with a significant risk of complications, such as infection, glaucoma, and vision loss. In this case, the patient has only had blurred vision for 8 weeks, so it is too early to consider PK.

Providing medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 months is a more conservative approach. However, this is unlikely to be effective in this case, as the patient has already been on this treatment for 8 weeks without improvement.

An anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram (AS-OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to assess the health of the cornea. It can provide detailed images of the cornea's layers, including the endothelium, which is the layer of cells that lines the inside of the cornea. In this case, an AS-OCT would be helpful to determine the cause of the corneal edema and to assess the patient's eligibility for other treatment options, such as endothelial keratoplasty.

Endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty) is a surgical procedure to replace the endothelium of the cornea. It is a less invasive procedure than PK, with a lower risk of complications. However, it is only suitable for patients with certain types of corneal edema. In this case, an AS-OCT would be helpful to determine whether endothelial keratoplasty is a viable option for the patient.

The patient in this case has unilateral frosted branch angiitis, which is a vasculitis of the retinal vessels. This condition is typically associated with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as antisynthetase syndrome. The patient in this case has a history of antisynthetase syndrome, which is consistent with the diagnosis of unilateral frosted branch angiitis.

The goal of treatment for unilateral frosted branch angiitis is to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the retinal vessels. This can be done with systemic immunosuppression, such as corticosteroids or azathioprine. However, in some cases, systemic immunosuppression may not be effective or may be associated with significant side effects. In these cases, intravitreal foscarnet may be used as a second-line treatment.

Intravitreal foscarnet is a medication that is injected directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. It works by inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus, which can cause retinal vasculitis. Intravitreal foscarnet is a safe and effective treatment for unilateral frosted branch angiitis. It has been shown to improve visual acuity and reduce the risk of further vision loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Escalate systemic immunosuppression. This is not the correct answer because the patient is already receiving systemic immunosuppression with azathioprine. In addition, systemic immunosuppression can be associated with significant side effects, such as infection and bone marrow suppression.
* Option C: Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry. These tests are not necessary to diagnose unilateral frosted branch angiitis. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.
* Option D: Whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography. This test is not necessary to diagnose unilateral frosted branch angiitis. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

A sclerosing polycystic adenoma is a benign tumor of the salivary glands that is characterized by the presence of multiple cysts and fibrosis. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor in children, and it usually occurs in the parotid gland. The tumor is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but it can occasionally cause pain or facial nerve paralysis. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment usually involves surgical excision of the tumor.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Acinic cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the salivary glands that is characterized by the presence of acinar cells. It is the most common type of malignant salivary gland tumor in adults, and it usually occurs in the parotid gland. The tumor is typically aggressive and can metastasize to distant sites. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment usually involves surgical excision of the tumor, followed by radiation therapy.
* Mammary analog secretory carcinoma is a rare type of malignant salivary gland tumor that is characterized by the presence of cells that resemble mammary gland cells. It usually occurs in women, and it is typically aggressive and can metastasize to distant sites. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment usually involves surgical excision of the tumor, followed by radiation therapy.
* Myoepithelial carcinoma is a rare type of malignant salivary gland tumor that is characterized by the presence of myoepithelial cells. It can occur in any salivary gland, but it is most common in the parotid gland. The tumor is typically aggressive and can metastasize to distant sites. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment usually involves surgical excision of the tumor, followed by radiation therapy.

 17%|█▋        | 263/1525 [1:04:51<4:37:23, 13.19s/it]The correct diagnosis is Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient has a history of immunosuppression, which increases the risk of CMV infection.
* The patient has perianal ulcers, which are a common manifestation of CMV infection.
* The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen shows enlarged dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions, which are characteristic of CMV infection.

Amebic colitis is a rare infection caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. It is typically characterized by diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Amebic colitis is not a common cause of perianal ulcers.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including perianal ulcers. However, HSV infection is typically characterized by grouped vesicles, which are not present in this case.

Cutaneous Crohn disease is a rare inflammatory skin condition that can be associated with Crohn disease of the intestines. It is not a common cause of perianal ulcers.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are most consistent with CMV infection.

 17%|█▋        | 264/1525 [1:05:07<4:58:36, 14.21s/it]The correct answer is C. Lupus vulgaris.

Lupus vulgaris is a chronic granulomatous skin disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis. The disease typically presents as a single, slowly growing, painless, erythematous nodule on the face, neck, or upper extremities. The nodule may ulcerate and discharge a serosanguineous fluid. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination, which shows noncaseating granulomas in the dermis.

Lupus pernio is a rare form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that is characterized by violaceous plaques on the face, ears, and nose. The lesions are often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination, which shows perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and mucin deposition in the dermis.

Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents as a single, slowly growing, erythematous nodule on the skin. The nodule may ulcerate and discharge a serosanguineous fluid. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination, which shows a dense infiltrate of atypical T cells in the dermis.

Leishmania recidivans is a parasitic infection that is caused by Leishmania donovani. The disease is characterized by fever, malaise, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. The skin lesions are usually seen in the form of papules or nodules that may ulcerate. The diagnosis is confirmed by the identification of Leishmania parasites in the skin lesions.

The patient in the case presented with a single, slowly growing, painless, erythematous nodule on the right auricle. The lesion had been present since early childhood and had gradually increased in size. The patient had no history of systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or leishmaniasis. The histopathologic examination of the skin lesion showed noncaseating granulomas, which are characteristic of lupus vulgaris. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is C. Lupus vulgaris.

 17%|█▋        | 265/1525 [1:05:23<5:11:24, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is C. Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation.

The patient is a teenaged girl who has been experiencing recurrent episodes of chest and neck palpitations accompanied by headaches for 3 years. The palpitations are sudden in onset and offset, and she has no specific medical or family history. A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) while symptomatic showed a wide QRS complex rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute. After a short walk, the symptoms disappeared and another ECG was recorded, which showed a normal sinus rhythm. Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography results were normal.

The wide QRS complex rhythm on the ECG is concerning for a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction. SVTs are a group of heart arrhythmias that originate above the ventricles, and they can be caused by a variety of factors, including structural heart disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and medications. Aberrant conduction occurs when an electrical impulse from the atria travels down an abnormal pathway to the ventricles, resulting in a wide QRS complex on the ECG.

The most common type of SVT with aberrant conduction is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). WPW is a congenital heart condition characterized by an accessory pathway that allows electrical impulses to bypass the AV node and travel directly from the atria to the ventricles. This can result in a rapid heart rate, which can cause symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, and lightheadedness.

In the case of the teenaged girl, the wide QRS complex rhythm on the ECG is suggestive of WPW. However, it is important to note that other types of SVTs can also cause wide QRS complexes. Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to perform an electrophysiology study (EPS). An EPS is a procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the heart through a vein in the groin. These electrodes are used to map the electrical activity of the heart and to identify the location of the abnormal pathway in WPW.

If WPW is confirmed on EPS, the next step is to consider catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is a procedure in which the abnormal pathway is destroyed using radiofrequency energy. This procedure is very effective in treating WPW and can result in a cure for the arrhythmia.

Therapeutic abstention and patient reassurance (A) is not the best option in this case because the patient is experiencing recurrent episodes of palpitations. Medical therapy with propafenone or flecainide (B) is a possible option, but these medications can have serious side effects, such as proarrhythmia. Medical therapy with β-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil (D) is also a possible option, but these medications may not be effective in controlling the arrhythmia in all cases.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation. This is the best option because it is the most likely to provide a cure for the arrhythmia.

 17%|█▋        | 266/1525 [1:05:38<5:10:40, 14.81s/it]The correct answer is C. Measure serum niacin level.

The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of chronic nondeforming rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma resected 10 years prior. She is currently taking prednisolone (1 mg/d) and levothyroxine. She presents with 2 months of diarrhea and 2 weeks of rash. The diarrhea is postprandial and nonbloody, and occurs 5 times daily. The rash is pruritic and scaly, with an erythematous brawny peeling base, and is located on the neck and extremities. The patient is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, she is alert and cognitively intact, but appears emaciated. There is glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base on her neck and extremities. Findings on cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic examinations are unremarkable.

Laboratory studies show mild hyponatremia (132 mmol/L) and an otherwise normal basic metabolic panel. Other laboratory values are as follows: C-reactive protein, 0.58 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 23 mm/h; total protein, 4.8 g/dL; and albumin, 1.8 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is 7200/μL (66.5% neutrophils, 30.4% lymphocytes); hemoglobin level, 9.9 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 96 fL; and platelet count, 332 000/μL. Results of liver function tests, coagulation tests, urinalysis, thyroid function tests, measurement of serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levels, and cosyntropin stimulation tests were normal. Serum copper level was 46 μg (reference range, 66-130 μg) and zinc level was 23 μg (reference, ≥80 μg). Abdominal computed tomography revealed no abnormalities.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's diarrhea and rash is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and colon cancer raises the possibility of an inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. However, the patient's diarrhea is not bloody and she does not have fever or abdominal pain, which are more common in inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's history of hypothyroidism also raises the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome, such as celiac disease. However, the patient's celiac serology is negative and her abdominal computed tomography does not show any evidence of small bowel disease.

The patient's rash is most concerning for niacin deficiency. Niacin is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the synthesis of NAD and NADP, which are cofactors for many enzymes involved in energy metabolism. Niacin deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and colon cancer increases her risk of niacin deficiency, as these conditions can impair the absorption of nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to measure her serum niacin level. If the serum niacin level is low, the patient should be treated with niacin supplementation. Niacin supplementation can be given orally or intravenously. Oral niacin is typically given in doses of 50-100 mg three times daily. Intravenous niacin is typically given in doses of 50-100 mg once daily.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Measure fecal calprotectin level: Fecal calprotectin is a protein that is released by neutrophils in the gastrointestinal tract. Increased levels of fecal calprotectin are seen in inflammatory bowel disease, but the patient's diarrhea is not bloody and she does not have fever or abdominal pain, which are more common in inflammatory bowel disease.
* B. Check for fecal ova and parasites: Fecal ova and parasites are a common cause of diarrhea, but the patient's diarrhea is not bloody and she does not have fever or abdominal pain, which are more common in infectious diarrhea.
* D. Test for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody: Serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody is a serologic marker for celiac disease. The patient's celiac serology is negative.

 18%|█▊        | 267/1525 [1:05:55<5:20:12, 15.27s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain serum vitamin levels.

The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder, which can lead to malnutrition. Malnutrition can cause a number of problems, including impaired wound healing. In this case, the patient has a nonhealing epithelial defect, which is a type of wound. Therefore, it is important to check the patient's serum vitamin levels to rule out malnutrition as a cause of the nonhealing defect.

The other choices are incorrect.

Choice A is incorrect because the patient is already receiving treatment with topical antibiotics. There is no evidence that the patient is not responding to treatment, so there is no need to change the antibiotics.

Choice B is incorrect because corneal cultures have already been performed and grown Streptococcus pneumonia. There is no need to repeat the cultures with Lowenstein-Jensen medium, which is a medium used to grow Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Choice C is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, which is an autoimmune disease that can cause anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies to be present in the serum.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Obtain serum vitamin levels.

 18%|█▊        | 268/1525 [1:06:09<5:16:00, 15.08s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform extraocular muscle biopsy.

The patient in this case has bilateral enlargement of all extraocular muscles. The most likely cause of this is orbital myositis, which is an inflammation of the extraocular muscles. Orbital myositis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infection, autoimmune disease, and neoplasm.

The first step in the management of orbital myositis is to determine the underlying cause. In this case, the patient has a history of hematologic malignancy, so it is possible that the orbital myositis is secondary to her cancer. However, there are other possible causes, so it is important to perform further testing to make a diagnosis.

One way to diagnose orbital myositis is to perform an extraocular muscle biopsy. This is a procedure in which a small piece of muscle is removed and examined under a microscope. A biopsy can help to determine the cause of the inflammation and to guide treatment.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with orbital myositis, and she has a history of hematologic malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an extraocular muscle biopsy. This will help to determine the cause of her inflammation and to guide treatment.

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this case. Prescribing high-dose intravenous steroids would be a reasonable treatment for orbital myositis if the cause was known. However, in this case, the cause is unknown, so it is not appropriate to start treatment without knowing the underlying cause. Performing staged bilateral orbital decompressions is a surgical procedure that is used to treat severe proptosis. In this case, the patient's proptosis is not severe, so this procedure is not necessary. Referring for bilateral orbital external beam radiation is a treatment option for orbital myositis, but it is typically used in cases where other treatments have failed. In this case, the patient has not yet been treated, so it is premature to refer her for radiation therapy.

A is incorrect because it is not appropriate to reassure the patient and do nothing. The patient has worsening floaters, decreased visual acuity, and CME in both eyes. These findings are concerning for a retinal detachment, which is a serious condition that requires treatment.

B is incorrect because it is not appropriate to give an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, which is a different condition than the one the patient has.

D is incorrect because it is not appropriate to recommend a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy. A temporal craniotomy is a surgery that is used to access the brain. It is not appropriate for the patient in this case because she does not have a brain tumor.

The correct answer is C. Perform a vitrectomy with cytology and immunohistochemistry. A vitrectomy is a surgery that is used to remove the vitreous humor from the eye. The vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina. A vitrectomy can be used to treat a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and macular edema.

Cytology is the study of cells. Immunohistochemistry is a technique that is used to identify proteins in cells. In this case, cytology and immunohistochemistry will be used to determine the cause of the patient's CME. If the CME is caused by a tumor, then the patient will need to be treated with radiation therapy or chemotherapy. If the CME is not caused by a tumor, then the patient may be treated with medications or surgery.

 18%|█▊        | 270/1525 [1:06:40<5:21:01, 15.35s/it]The correct answer is C. Start systemic corticosteroids.

The patient in this case has developed orbital swelling and erythema 3 days after receiving intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) for retinoblastoma. The most likely cause of this is an allergic reaction to the chemotherapy drugs. Systemic corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for allergic reactions. They work by suppressing the immune system, which helps to reduce inflammation and swelling.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Antimicrobials such as vancomycin and cefepime are not indicated in the absence of infection. Examination under anesthesia is not necessary in the absence of a mass lesion or other ocular abnormality. Observation is not appropriate in the setting of a known allergic reaction, as this could lead to further progression of the reaction and possible complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Start systemic corticosteroids.

NEH is a rare, neutrophilic dermatosis that typically presents with tender, erythematous plaques and nodules on the palms, soles, and axillae. It is often associated with underlying systemic conditions, such as hematologic malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders. The diagnosis of NEH is made based on clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Treatment is typically with oral steroids and/or antibiotics.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sweet syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis that is typically associated with fever, malaise, and arthralgias. It is not typically associated with underlying systemic conditions.
* Urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by wheals (raised, red, itchy bumps). It is not typically associated with underlying systemic conditions.

Cervical necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection that can lead to death if not treated promptly. It is characterized by rapidly spreading inflammation and necrosis of the soft tissues of the neck. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic signs or symptoms of cervical necrotizing fasciitis, such as fever, chills, severe pain, or rapidly progressive swelling. Additionally, the CT scan shows no evidence of infection, such as abscesses or gas in the soft tissues.

Angioedema is a type of allergic reaction that can cause swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, and other parts of the body. It is usually caused by an allergic reaction to a medication, food, or insect bite. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as hives, itching, or wheezing. Additionally, the CT scan shows no evidence of allergic reaction, such as swelling of the airways.

Quincke edema is a type of angioedema that is caused by an allergic reaction to a medication, food, or insect bite. It is characterized by sudden, severe swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, and other parts of the body. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic signs or symptoms of Quincke edema, such as hives, itching, or wheezing. Additionally, the CT scan shows no evidence of allergic reaction, such as swelling of the airways.

Spontaneous lymphorrhea is a condition in which lymph fluid leaks from the lymphatic system. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, surgery, or trauma. The patient in this case has a history of spontaneous lymphorrhea, and the CT scan shows a large retropharyngeal fluid collection. This is consistent with the diagnosis of spontaneous lymphorrhea.

The patient's history of factor V Leiden deficiency, a genetic disorder that increases the risk of blood clots, and his current anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, a medication that thins the blood, make him at increased risk for spontaneous bleeding. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling are consistent with airway obstruction. The physical exam findings of substantial dysphonia, fullness in the left submandibular region, and ecchymosis of the lateral left neck extending toward the midline are also consistent with airway obstruction. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography findings of a large, intermediate-density, modestly enhancing, left-sided submucosal lesion extending from the nasopharynx inferiorly to the glottis with encroachment on the airway are also consistent with airway obstruction. The flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy findings of a large submucosal mass extending from the left posteroinferior nasopharyngeal wall to the left lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls, obstructing the view of the left supraglottis, glottis, and piriform sinus, are also consistent with airway obstruction. Given the important laryngoscopy findings, the decision was made to proceed with awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation in the operating room to secure the patient's airway.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Abscess: An abscess is a collection of pus that forms in response to infection. The patient's history and physical exam findings are not consistent with an abscess.
* Head and neck malignant neoplasm(s): A head and neck malignant neoplasm is a cancerous tumor that grows in the head or neck. The patient's history and physical exam findings are not consistent with a head and neck malignant neoplasm.
* Angioedema: Angioedema is a condition that causes swelling of the skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues. The patient's history and physical exam findings are not consistent with angioedema.

A Becker nevus is a congenital hyperpigmented lesion that is most often seen in males. It is typically unilateral and located on the trunk or proximal extremities. Becker nevi are not associated with any other medical problems.

A smooth muscle hamartoma is a rare benign tumor of smooth muscle cells. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the skin. Smooth muscle hamartomas are usually small and asymptomatic.

A plexiform neurofibroma is a type of neurofibroma that is characterized by a large, complex mass of nerve tissue. Plexiform neurofibromas are often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

The patient in the case presented has a large, well-defined, firm yellow to skin-colored multinodular hypertrichotic plaque on the left lower back. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of a neurocristic hamartoma. The histopathologic findings of the biopsy, which show a diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells, predominantly encircling terminal folliculosebaceous units, are also consistent with a neurocristic hamartoma. Immunohistochemical staining reveals diffuse and periadnexal S100 positivity in the mid to deep dermis, which is a characteristic finding of neurocristic hamartomas.

The patient has a right atrial mass. Cardiac MRI is the best imaging modality to evaluate cardiac masses. It can provide detailed information about the size, shape, location, and composition of the mass. It can also assess the function of the heart and the surrounding structures.

Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that can be used to diagnose and stage cancer. It is not as good as cardiac MRI for evaluating cardiac masses.

Right heart catheterization for biopsy is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into a vein in the leg and threaded up to the heart. A sample of tissue from the mass is then taken for biopsy. This procedure is invasive and carries some risks, such as bleeding and infection.

Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a type of ultrasound that is performed through the esophagus. It can be used to evaluate cardiac masses, but it is not as good as cardiac MRI for this purpose.

In conclusion, cardiac MRI is the best imaging modality to evaluate cardiac masses. It is safe, accurate, and provides detailed information about the mass. It is the preferred imaging modality for the patient in the case.

The patient has a purpuric rash over his right foot accompanied by 1 week of episodic fever, diaphoresis, and headaches. Six weeks prior, he fell from a ladder and had right nondisplaced medial malleolar and comminuted talar fractures. The fractures were managed nonsurgically in a controlled ankle movement boot, with resolution of swelling and bruising.

The differential diagnosis for a purpuric rash includes a number of conditions, including vasculitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenic purpura, and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. In this case, the patient's history of a recent fall from a ladder and the presence of right lower extremity edema suggest that the purpuric rash may be secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a serious condition that can lead to pulmonary embolism, so it is important to diagnose and treat it promptly.

A lower extremity duplex ultrasound is a non-invasive test that can be used to diagnose DVT. The test uses sound waves to create images of the blood vessels in the lower leg. If a DVT is present, the ultrasound will show a blockage of the blood vessel.

Ordering a lower extremity duplex ultrasound is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The test will help to confirm the diagnosis of DVT and allow for the initiation of appropriate treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A skin biopsy is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with DVT.
* Ordering antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an autoimmune disorder.
* Ordering antibiotic therapy is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an infection.

The patient has a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which can cause a variety of skin problems, including palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPP). PPP is a chronic, relapsing, and remitting skin disease characterized by the eruption of sterile pustules on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The lesions are often painful and can be disfiguring.

Zinc is an essential mineral that is involved in many important bodily functions, including immune function, wound healing, and the production of new skin cells. Zinc deficiency is a common problem in people with HCV infection, and it can worsen the symptoms of PPP. Oral zinc therapy is an effective treatment for PPP, and it can help to reduce the number and severity of the lesions.

The other answer choices are incorrect because:

* A. Perform incisional biopsy: This is not necessary in the case of PPP, as the diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history and physical examination.
* B. Prescribe amoxicillin/clavulanic acid: This is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. PPP is not caused by a bacterial infection, so antibiotics are not effective treatment.
* C. Order computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis: This is a diagnostic test that is used to look for abnormalities in the abdomen and pelvis. It is not necessary in the case of PPP, as the diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history and physical examination.

The patient has an APOE ɛ 4 allele, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, the patient is currently asymptomatic and has normal cognitive function. Further testing, such as brain FDG-PET scan or CSF testing, is not necessary at this time. It is important to reassure the patient that he is not currently experiencing any cognitive decline and that there is no need to change his lifestyle or make any major decisions at this time. However, it is also important to follow up with the patient in 1 year to repeat the cognitive assessment and to monitor for any changes in his condition.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Obtain a brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan. This is an expensive and invasive test that is not necessary in the absence of symptoms.
* B. Order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers. This is also an invasive test that is not necessary in the absence of symptoms.
* D. Refer for genetic counseling. Genetic counseling is not necessary at this time. The patient is already aware of his APOE ɛ 4 allele status and there is no need to take any specific action based on this information.

 18%|█▊        | 280/1525 [1:08:58<4:26:23, 12.84s/it]The correct answer is C: Order an electrocardiogram.

The patient presented with bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, which are symptoms of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack and destroy the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness. The most common initial symptom of MG is ptosis, which is often followed by ophthalmoplegia. Other symptoms may include diplopia, facial weakness, and dysphagia.

The diagnosis of MG is made with a history and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests such as the Tensilon test and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The Tensilon test is a diagnostic test for MG in which a medication called edrophonium is injected intravenously. Edrophonium causes a temporary increase in the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which can improve muscle strength in patients with MG. An ECG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. An ECG may show changes that are consistent with MG, such as atrioventricular block or bundle branch block.

The treatment of MG includes medications such as pyridostigmine (Mestinon) and prednisone. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that suppresses the immune system. Other treatments for MG may include plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Plasmapheresis is a procedure in which blood is removed from the body, the plasma is separated from the blood cells, and the plasma is then returned to the body. IVIg is a treatment that involves giving patients high doses of antibodies from donated blood.

The prognosis for patients with MG is generally good. With treatment, most patients can control their symptoms and live normal lives. However, some patients may experience long-term complications of MG, such as weakness of the respiratory muscles.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

A: Perform surgical repair of ptosis with frontalis sling is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's ptosis is likely due to MG, which is a medical condition that requires treatment with medication. Surgical repair of ptosis would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B: Order neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor or other structural abnormality. Neuroimaging may be ordered in patients with MG who have other symptoms that suggest a neurological disorder, such as seizures or cognitive impairment. However, neuroimaging is not necessary in patients with MG who have only ptosis and ophthalmoplegia.

D: Investigate for thyroid eye disease is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with thyroid eye disease. Thyroid eye disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the muscles and tissues around the eyes. Symptoms of thyroid eye disease may include ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, diplopia, and proptosis (bulging of the eyes). However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of thyroid eye disease.

The patient has a clinical presentation consistent with sigmoid sinus thrombosis, which is a rare but serious complication of bacterial meningitis. The most common presenting symptoms are headache, fever, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. Papilledema is a common finding on fundoscopic examination. Lumbar puncture is the gold standard for diagnosis, as it allows for the evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for signs of infection, such as pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. Treatment of sigmoid sinus thrombosis is with antibiotics and anticoagulation.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Initiation of anticoagulation is not indicated in the absence of a bleeding diathesis.
* C. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement is not indicated in the absence of hydrocephalus.
* D. High-dose intravenous steroids are not indicated in the absence of cerebral edema.

The patient has a history of multiple skin malignant neoplasms, and the lesion on his cornea appears to be a grayish opacity that is lusterless and abuts the nasal limbus. This is concerning for a possible malignancy, such as squamous cell carcinoma. Superficial keratectomy is a procedure in which a small piece of the cornea is removed for biopsy. This would allow the pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.

Calcium chelation with EDTA therapy is a treatment for hypercalcemia, which is a condition in which the blood calcium level is too high. This is not the patient's diagnosis, so this treatment would not be appropriate.

Penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure in which a diseased cornea is replaced with a donor cornea. This is a major surgery with significant risks, and it is not the first-line treatment for a corneal lesion. It would only be considered if the lesion was very severe and was not responding to other treatments.

Observation with follow-up for changes over the next 6 to 12 months is a reasonable approach for some corneal lesions. However, in this case, the lesion is concerning for a malignancy, so it is important to obtain a diagnosis as soon as possible.

Folliculitis decalvans is a rare, inflammatory condition of the hair follicles that can lead to hair loss. It is characterized by small, red bumps that develop around the hair follicles and can become pustular. The bumps may eventually crust over and leave scars. Folliculitis decalvans is most common in men and is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of bacteria on the skin.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in the squamous cells, which are the flat cells that make up the outer layer of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma can appear as a red, scaly patch, a raised bump, or an open sore. It is most common on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, ears, and hands. Squamous cell carcinoma is usually treatable with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

Erosive pustular dermatosis is a rare, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by the development of erosions (open sores) and pustules (small, pus-filled bumps) on the scalp. The condition is most commonly seen in patients with underlying immune system disorders, such as HIV/AIDS or cancer. Erosive pustular dermatosis is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of bacteria on the skin, and it is often treated with antibiotics.

Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the development of flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving behind eroded areas of skin. Pemphigus foliaceus is most commonly seen in adults, and it is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction in which the body's immune system attacks its own skin cells. Pemphigus foliaceus is treated with a combination of medications, including corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.

In the case of the 73-year-old man with metastatic BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, the most likely diagnosis is erosive pustular dermatosis. This is because the patient has a history of actinic damage on the scalp, which is a risk factor for erosive pustular dermatosis. Additionally, the patient's scalp eruption is characterized by the development of erosions and pustules, which are the classic features of erosive pustular dermatosis. Finally, the patient's scalp eruption was responsive to treatment with antibiotics, which is consistent with the diagnosis of erosive pustular dermatosis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Folliculitis decalvans is a rare condition that is not typically associated with a history of actinic damage. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is more commonly seen on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, ears, and hands. Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disorder that is not typically associated with a history of actinic damage or treatment with antibiotics.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, stiff neck, and a rash. However, meningitis does not typically cause anosmia (loss of smell), and it would not explain the patient's other symptoms, such as her history of a laryngeal tracheoesophageal fissure, intestinal hernia, and hearing loss.

The VACTERL constellation is a group of birth defects that can affect the heart, lungs, spine, and other organs. It is not typically associated with anosmia, and it would not explain the patient's other symptoms.

Kallmann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls hormones. It can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition in which the body does not produce enough sex hormones. This can lead to delayed puberty, infertility, and other symptoms. However, Kallmann syndrome would not explain the patient's anosmia.

MRKH syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that affects the development of the female reproductive system. Women with MRKH syndrome are born without a uterus or vagina, and they may have other abnormalities of the reproductive system, such as a shortened or blind-ending vagina. MRKH syndrome is usually diagnosed in adolescence, when a girl does not start her menstrual period. It is caused by a mutation in one of several genes, and there is no cure. However, there are treatments that can help women with MRKH syndrome to have a normal sex life and to carry a pregnancy to term.

The patient in the case presented with a history of anosmia, a laryngeal tracheoesophageal fissure, intestinal hernia, hearing loss, and delayed puberty. She also had normal ovaries, but an MRI showed that she had a vaginal defect and uterine rudiments. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of MRKH syndrome.

Eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE) is a rare, self-limiting skin condition characterized by erythematous annular plaques with central clearing. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. The cause of EAE is unknown, but it is thought to be an allergic reaction. EAE is usually associated with other allergic conditions, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.

The typical presentation of EAE is an erythematous annular plaque with central clearing. The plaques are usually 1-2 cm in diameter, but can be larger. They are often pruritic, and may be associated with fever, malaise, and arthralgias.

The diagnosis of EAE is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows a perivascular infiltrate of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.

The treatment of EAE is usually with oral corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids may also be used. In severe cases, systemic immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

Eosinophilic annular erythema is a benign condition with a good prognosis. Most patients experience complete resolution of the rash within a few weeks to months. However, the condition may recur in some patients.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient.

A. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a chronic skin condition characterized by erythematous annular plaques with central clearing. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and older adults. The cause of erythema annulare centrifugum is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition.

Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that originates in the mantle zone of the lymph node. It is characterized by a monoclonal proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours. The disease is usually diagnosed in older adults, with a median age of presentation of 65 years. The most common presenting symptoms are lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and weight loss. Mantle cell lymphoma is a slow-growing lymphoma, but it is incurable with current therapies. The median survival for patients with mantle cell lymphoma is 5-6 years.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin. It is not associated with lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms.
* Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, fever, and night sweats. It is not associated with the skin lesions or systemic symptoms seen in this patient.
* Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of low-grade B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. It is not associated with the skin lesions or systemic symptoms seen in this patient.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for this patient is mantle cell lymphoma. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The other choices are incorrect for the reasons stated above.

The patient in the case presented with a viral prodrome, palpitations, dizziness, and heart block. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute. Investigation revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. These findings are consistent with an inflammatory process.

The most likely cause of the patient's heart block is an inflammatory condition affecting the atrioventricular node or His-Purkinje system. This could be due to a viral infection, such as Lyme disease or Epstein-Barr virus, or an autoimmune condition, such as sarcoidosis.

The treatment of choice for an inflammatory cause of heart block is to place a temporary pacemaker and start corticosteroids. The pacemaker will provide the patient with adequate cardiac output while the corticosteroids help to reduce the inflammation.

A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any evidence of ventricular arrhythmias. An implantable pacemaker is also not indicated because the patient's heart block is likely to be reversible with treatment.

The patient's condition improved after placement of a temporary pacemaker and initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The patient's heart block resolved and he was able to be discharged from the hospital.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* **A. Place a temporary pacemaker and start ceftriaxone:** This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any evidence of infection. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections.
* **B. Place a temporary pacemaker and start corticosteroids:** This is the correct answer because the patient has an inflammatory condition affecting the atrioventricular node or His-Purkinje system. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce the inflammation and improve the patient's condition.
* **C. Place a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator:** This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any evidence of ventricular arrhythmias. A dual-chamber ICD is a device that is implanted in the chest to monitor the heart rhythm and deliver an electric shock if it detects a ventricular arrhythmia.
* **D. Implant a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker:** This is not the correct answer because the patient's heart block is likely to be reversible with treatment. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker is a device that is implanted in the chest to provide a regular heartbeat if the patient's natural pacemaker is not working properly.

 19%|█▉        | 289/1525 [1:10:58<5:07:06, 14.91s/it]The correct diagnosis is Rett syndrome.

Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs in females. It is caused by the absence of one of the X chromosomes. Symptoms of Turner syndrome include short stature, infertility, and heart defects. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder that affects girls. It is caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene. Symptoms of Rett syndrome include loss of acquired skills, seizures, and movement problems. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males and females. It is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. Symptoms of Fragile X syndrome include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures. Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders that affect movement and coordination. It can be caused by a number of factors, including brain injury, infection, or stroke.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with Rett syndrome. These include microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy. The patient also has a history of progressive developmental delay, including loss of acquired communication and motor functions. The patient's brain magnetic resonance imaging studies show a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry. These findings are all consistent with Rett syndrome.

Turner syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and cerebral palsy are all possible diagnoses for the patient in this case. However, none of these diagnoses explain all of the patient's symptoms. Turner syndrome does not typically cause intellectual disability or seizures. Fragile X syndrome does not typically cause scoliosis or gait abnormality. Cerebral palsy does not typically cause microcephaly or encephalopathy.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is Rett syndrome.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with kwashiorkor, a protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) disorder that is most commonly seen in children under the age of 5. PEM is a serious condition that can lead to death if not treated.

The most common laboratory findings in kwashiorkor are low levels of serum albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional markers. These laboratory tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of kwashiorkor and assess the severity of the condition.

Treatment for kwashiorkor includes providing the patient with a high-protein diet and other nutritional supplements. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate initial management for a patient with kwashiorkor.

* Check urinalysis and urine microscopy to evaluate for protein in urine: This is not the most appropriate initial management for a patient with kwashiorkor because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a urinary tract infection.
* Perform a skin biopsy: This is not the most appropriate initial management for a patient with kwashiorkor because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a skin disorder.
* Treat with topical steroids: This is not the most appropriate initial management for a patient with kwashiorkor because topical steroids will not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition, which is a lack of protein in the diet.

 19%|█▉        | 291/1525 [1:11:22<4:36:50, 13.46s/it]The correct answer is D. Pursue surgical evaluation.

The patient's presentation is consistent with infective endocarditis, a serious infection of the heart valves. Infective endocarditis is a medical emergency, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent complications.

The most common symptoms of infective endocarditis are fever, chills, night sweats, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include weight loss, joint pain, and a new or changing heart murmur.

The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Blood cultures are essential for diagnosis, and they should be obtained in all patients with suspected infective endocarditis. Other laboratory tests that may be helpful include an electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, and echocardiography.

The treatment of infective endocarditis is with antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics depends on the type of bacteria that is causing the infection. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove an infected valve or to repair a heart defect.

The patient in this case has a number of features that are concerning for infective endocarditis. She has a fever, a heart murmur, and petechiae on her skin. The CT scan of her head showed two acute infarcts in the right cerebellum, which is consistent with emboli from an infected heart valve. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, which is also consistent with infective endocarditis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with infective endocarditis. The next step in her management should be to pursue surgical evaluation. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and treatment of her infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

* Option A, perform a skin biopsy, is not necessary in this case. The petechiae on the patient's skin are likely due to emboli from an infected heart valve. A skin biopsy would not provide any additional information about the cause of her symptoms.
* Option B, administer tissue plasminogen activator, is not appropriate in this case. Tissue plasminogen activator is a medication that is used to dissolve blood clots. However, the patient's symptoms are not due to a blood clot.
* Option C, start empirical intravenous antibiotics, is not the best option in this case. Empirical antibiotics are antibiotics that are started without knowing the specific cause of an infection. In this case, the patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of infective endocarditis. Therefore, it is important to obtain blood cultures before starting antibiotics. Once the results of the blood cultures are known, the antibiotics can be tailored to the specific bacteria that is causing the infection.

The best course of action for the patient is to pursue surgical evaluation. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and treatment of her infection.

 19%|█▉        | 292/1525 [1:11:37<4:47:41, 14.00s/it]The correct answer is C: Examine the abdomen during the EUA.

The patient is a 14-month-old girl with a history of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. The clinical examination revealed 180° of left inferior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid. The patient also had a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally, a 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface, and a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension. Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause.

The differential diagnosis for a recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage includes trauma, infection, vascular disorders, and neoplasms. In this case, the history of recurrent hemorrhages, the presence of an intraocular lesion, and the large orbital mass suggest a neoplasm. The most common orbital neoplasm in children is a hemangioma, which is a benign vascular tumor. However, other types of neoplasms, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, can also occur in children.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a biopsy of the orbital mass. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and will help to determine the best course of treatment. However, before performing the biopsy, it is important to examine the abdomen to rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, a child with a hemangioma may also have a hemangioma in the liver. If this is the case, the child may need to be treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Aspirating the orbital lesion is not necessary and could potentially damage the lesion. Scheduling an orbital computed tomography scan is important, but it should be done after the biopsy has been performed. Referring the child for a biopsy of the lesion is the correct answer, but it is important to first examine the abdomen to rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

The patient has a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect resulting in right hypoglobus, multiple communicating channels through inner and outer tables with cortical breakthrough in the frontal sinus, and advanced dental caries that communicated directly with the maxillary sinus owing to cortex erosion. This is a complex case that requires a multidisciplinary approach. The goal of treatment is to drain the abscess, eradicate the infection, and prevent complications.

Excisional biopsy is not the correct answer because it would not address the underlying infection. Intravenous antibiotics and observation are not the correct answer because the patient has a large abscess that requires drainage. Referral to an ear, nose, and throat physician for removal of frontal sinus cystic lining is not the correct answer because the patient also has an abscess in the maxillary sinus.

The best approach is to perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery. This will allow for drainage of the abscess and removal of the infected tissue. It will also allow for visualization of the frontal sinus and maxillary sinus, which can be treated with endoscopic sinus surgery. This approach is most likely to achieve the goal of treatment and prevent complications.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* Excision biopsy is not the correct answer because it would not address the underlying infection. The patient has a large abscess that requires drainage. Excisional biopsy would only remove a small piece of tissue, which would not be enough to treat the infection.
* Intravenous antibiotics and observation are not the correct answer because the patient has a large abscess that requires drainage. Intravenous antibiotics may be used to treat the infection, but they will not be enough to drain the abscess. The patient also needs to have the abscess drained surgically.
* Referral to an ear, nose, and throat physician for removal of frontal sinus cystic lining is not the correct answer because the patient also has an abscess in the maxillary sinus. The patient needs to have both abscesses drained surgically. Referral to an ear, nose, and throat physician for removal of frontal sinus cystic lining would only address the abscess in the frontal sinus.

The best approach is to perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery. This will allow for drainage of the abscess and removal of the infected tissue. It will also allow for visualization of the frontal sinus and maxillary sinus, which can be treated with endoscopic sinus surgery.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a serious underlying condition, such as a tumor or an aneurysm. The dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels are a red flag, as they are a classic sign of an intracranial mass. The patient's history of a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear are also concerning. These symptoms could be due to increased intracranial pressure, which can be a sign of a tumor or an aneurysm.

Supportive strategies, such as cold compresses, ocular lubricants, and increasing the topical corticosteroid treatment or prescribing a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), are not likely to be helpful in this case. The patient's condition is likely to progress despite these measures, and she could experience serious complications, such as blindness or death.

Prescribing an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression (oral corticosteroid) and performing chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and other studies are not necessary in this case. The patient's presentation is not consistent with an inflammatory or allergic condition, and these tests are unlikely to reveal any useful information.

Performing a general examination (for a port-wine stain) and dilated ophthalmoscopy are also not necessary in this case. The patient's presentation is not consistent with a port-wine stain, and a dilated ophthalmoscopy is unlikely to reveal any useful information.

The most appropriate next step is to refer the patient for urgent neuroimaging. This will allow for the diagnosis of the underlying condition and the initiation of appropriate treatment.

A computed tomographic scan (CT scan) is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. CT scans can be used to diagnose a variety of medical conditions, including tumors, infections, and injuries.

In the case of a child with acute eyelid edema and proptosis, a CT scan of the orbits is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation. A CT scan can help to determine the size, location, and nature of the mass in the orbit. This information can then be used to determine the best course of treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Observe is not the correct answer because the patient has a mass in the orbit that needs to be evaluated further.
* Option C: Perform a biopsy is not the correct answer because a biopsy is not necessary if a CT scan can provide enough information to make a diagnosis.
* Option D: Begin treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is not the correct answer because these treatments are not appropriate for a patient with a mass in the orbit without a confirmed diagnosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B: Obtain computed tomographic scan of the orbits.

The patient is a female smoker in her 50s with a history of hyperparathyroidism and a multinodular goiter. She presented with symptoms of joint and musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Her medical history was remarkable for congestive heart failure and schizophrenia.

On physical examination, she had no significant findings except for right thyroid enlargement. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal white blood cell count, borderline hypercalcemia (10.6 mg/dL), and elevated parathyroid hormone level (208 pg/mL).

She underwent ultrasonography at an outside facility, and results demonstrated a 2.2-cm dominant right thyroid nodule with additional smaller thyroid nodules. Findings of preoperative technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi planar and single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) imaging were nonlocalizing for a parathyroid adenoma and showed increased uptake in the dominant right thyroid nodule. Results of an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid nodule demonstrated a benign colloid nodule with cystic changes.

Computed tomography with intravenous contrast was obtained, and findings were initially reported as negative except for right multinodular goiter. However, on additional review, a well-circumscribed fat density mass measuring 3.0 × 2.3 × 1.1-cm was identified in the right retropharyngeal space posterior to the hypopharynx.

The differential diagnosis for a retropharyngeal mass includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including lymphadenopathy, abscess, hematoma, tumor, and vascular malformations. In this case, the patient's history of hyperparathyroidism and the location of the mass in the right retropharyngeal space make the diagnosis of ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma most likely.

Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma is a rare condition that occurs when a parathyroid gland migrates from its normal location in the neck to another part of the body, such as the retropharyngeal space. The condition is typically asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as neck pain, dysphagia, and hoarseness.

The diagnosis of ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, which can show the location of the mass. The condition is usually treated with surgery to remove the mass.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is typically found in the extremities. It is not a common cause of a retropharyngeal mass.
* Ectopic thyroid is a condition that occurs when a thyroid gland develops in an abnormal location, such as the tongue or the neck. It is not a common cause of a retropharyngeal mass.
* Retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the retropharyngeal space. It is a common cause of a retropharyngeal mass in children, but it is rare in adults.

AOT is a benign odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements. It is the most common odontogenic tumor in the maxilla, and it typically occurs in young adults. The clinical presentation of AOT is variable, but it can present with a painless swelling or a draining fistula. Radiographically, AOT appears as a well-defined radiolucency that may contain calcifications. Histologically, AOT is characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements. The tumor is typically well-circumscribed and encapsulated, and it does not have a high rate of recurrence. Treatment for AOT is surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Dentigerous cyst is a non-neoplastic cyst that is associated with an impacted tooth. It is typically found in young adults, and it presents as a painless swelling. Radiographically, a dentigerous cyst appears as a well-defined radiolucency that surrounds the crown of an impacted tooth. Histologically, a dentigerous cyst is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Treatment for a dentigerous cyst is surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent.
* Odontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumor) is a benign odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with keratin production. It is the most common odontogenic tumor in the mandible, and it typically occurs in young adults. The clinical presentation of odontogenic keratocyst is variable, but it can present with a painless swelling or a draining fistula. Radiographically, odontogenic keratocyst appears as a well-defined radiolucency that may contain calcifications. Histologically, odontogenic keratocyst is characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with keratin production. The tumor is typically well-circumscribed and encapsulated, but it has a high rate of recurrence. Treatment for odontogenic keratocyst is surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent.
* Ameloblastoma is a locally aggressive odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of ameloblasts. It is the most common odontogenic tumor in the mandible, and it typically occurs in adults. The clinical presentation of ameloblastoma is variable, but it can present with a painless swelling or a draining fistula. Radiographically, ameloblastoma appears as a well-defined radiolucency that may contain calcifications. Histologically, ameloblastoma is characterized by a proliferation of ameloblasts.

 20%|█▉        | 298/1525 [1:13:12<5:29:56, 16.13s/it]The correct diagnosis is palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome. This is a rare, autoimmune disease that affects the hands and fingers. It is characterized by inflammation and thickening of the palmar fascia, which is a band of tissue that runs along the palm of the hand. The inflammation can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the hands and fingers. In some cases, it can also lead to contractures, which are permanent bending of the fingers.

The exact cause of palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In the case of palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome, the immune system attacks the palmar fascia.

The symptoms of palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome usually develop gradually over time. The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the hands and fingers. The pain is often worse in the morning and after periods of inactivity. Other symptoms may include swelling, redness, and warmth in the hands and fingers. In some cases, the fingers may also become claw-like.

There is no cure for palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. The most common treatment is physical therapy. Physical therapy can help to improve range of motion and reduce pain. In some cases, medication may also be prescribed to help reduce inflammation and pain.

The prognosis for people with palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome is generally good. With treatment, most people are able to manage their symptoms and live a normal life. However, the condition can be progressive, and some people may eventually need surgery to correct contractures.

Here are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Dupuytren contracture is a condition that causes the fingers to curl inward. It is caused by the thickening and shortening of the palmar fascia. Dupuytren contracture is not an autoimmune disease, and it is not associated with polyarthritis.
* Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin, joints, and muscles. It is characterized by the development of nodules under the skin, as well as inflammation and pain in the joints. Fibroblastic rheumatism is not associated with palmar fasciitis.
* Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin, connective tissue, and internal organs. It is characterized by the thickening and hardening of the skin. Scleroderma is not associated with palmar fasciitis or polyarthritis.

 20%|█▉        | 299/1525 [1:13:28<5:26:26, 15.98s/it]The correct answer is A. Benign lymphangioendothelioma.

The patient is a healthy man in his 50s with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla. The lesion is nonindurated and well-defined, with no local lymphadenopathy. Biopsy specimens show vascular channel endothelial cells that are positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1). Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C are negative.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of benign lymphangioendothelioma, a rare vascular tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is typically a solitary lesion that presents as a small, painless nodule on the skin or mucous membranes. Benign lymphangioendothelioma is usually benign and does not require treatment, but it can occasionally recur or progress to a more aggressive form of cancer.

Kaposi sarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is most commonly seen in people with HIV/AIDS, but it can also occur in people who are immunocompromised for other reasons. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as multiple purplish or brown lesions on the skin, but it can also involve the lymph nodes, lungs, and other organs. Kaposi sarcoma is usually treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Hobnail hemangioma is a benign tumor of the blood vessels that typically occurs in the skin. It is characterized by large, irregular blood vessels that have a hobnail-like appearance. Hobnail hemangioma is usually a small, asymptomatic lesion that does not require treatment. However, it can occasionally grow larger and become symptomatic, in which case it may be treated with surgery or laser therapy.

Low-grade angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the blood vessels. It typically presents as a solitary, painless nodule on the skin. Low-grade angiosarcoma can sometimes be cured with surgery, but it often recurs or spreads to other parts of the body. Treatment for low-grade angiosarcoma typically includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of benign lymphangioendothelioma. The other options are less likely because they are associated with different clinical features and treatment options.

Balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV) and transcatheter mitral valve-in-ring procedure (TMVR) are both invasive procedures that are not recommended for pregnant women due to the risk of complications. Surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR) is a safe and effective treatment for mitral regurgitation, but it is also a major surgery that carries a risk of complications. In this case, the patient is 19 weeks pregnant and has mild exertional dyspnea, a right ventricular (RV) heave, and elevated jugular venous pulsation. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal biventricular function, mild RV dilation, RV systolic pressure of 84 mm Hg, normal left atrial size, and mean MV gradient of 18 mm Hg at a heart rate of 97 bpm. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mean MV gradient of 21 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 bpm. The patient strongly desired this pregnancy and declined termination.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and her desire to continue her pregnancy, the best option is to trial medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can help to reduce the heart rate and improve cardiac output. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that can help to prevent blood clots. If the patient's symptoms worsen, then further intervention may be necessary. However, at this time, trial medical management is the best option.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* BMV is an invasive procedure that is not recommended for pregnant women due to the risk of complications.
* TMVR is a newer procedure that is not yet widely available. There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of TMVR in pregnant women.
* Surgical MVR is a safe and effective treatment for mitral regurgitation, but it is also a major surgery that carries a risk of complications. In this case, the patient is 19 weeks pregnant and has mild exertional dyspnea. Surgical MVR would be a major undertaking at this stage in her pregnancy.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease that affects the immune system. It is characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell, in the skin, bone, and other organs. The symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis vary depending on the organs involved. In some cases, the disease may cause no symptoms at all. In other cases, it may cause fever, rash, bone pain, and other problems. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer that starts in nerve cells. It is the most common type of cancer in infants and young children. Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it most often starts in the adrenal glands, which are located above the kidneys. The symptoms of neuroblastoma vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. In some cases, the tumor may cause no symptoms at all. In other cases, it may cause pain, swelling, and other problems. Neuroblastoma is treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the immune system. They are located throughout the body, including the neck, armpits, and groin. Lymphoma can start in any of the lymph nodes. The symptoms of lymphoma vary depending on the type and stage of the disease. In some cases, the lymphoma may cause no symptoms at all. In other cases, it may cause fever, night sweats, weight loss, and other problems. Lymphoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

In the case presented, the patient is a 7-year-old African American girl with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling for 2 months. Initially, she experienced fever and sore throat. Physical examination findings demonstrated minimally tender and nonmobile 4-cm right submandibular space swelling. Laboratory examination findings were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level. Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. She was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum. Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton.

The patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, benign disorder of the immune system. It is characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes, a type of white blood cell. The histiocytes typically accumulate in the lymph nodes, but they can also be found in other organs, such as the skin, bone, and central nervous system.

The symptoms of Rosai-Dorfman disease vary depending on the organs involved. In some cases, the disease may cause no symptoms at all. In other cases, it may cause fever, rash, bone pain, and other problems. Rosai-Dorfman disease is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and steroids.

The patient has a history of ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, which is a rare type of lung cancer that responds well to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as crizotinib. However, TKI-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a serious side effect of these drugs that can occur in up to 20% of patients. ILD is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which can lead to shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue.

In this case, the patient developed a dry cough three weeks after starting crizotinib treatment. This is a common symptom of ILD, and the patient's chest radiography results showed a new consolidation lesion over the right upper lobe, which is also consistent with ILD. However, the patient's carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level decreased, which is a sign that the cancer is responding to treatment.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a CT-guided biopsy of the consolidation lesion. This will allow the doctor to determine whether the lesion is due to ILD or recurrence of the cancer. If the lesion is due to ILD, the doctor can then treat the patient with steroids and other medications to reduce the inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue. If the lesion is due to recurrence of the cancer, the doctor can then switch the patient to a different TKI or consider other treatment options such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Treating the patient with chemotherapy for disease recurrence is not appropriate at this time because there is no evidence that the cancer has recurred.
* Option B: Administering antibiotics with coverage for pneumonia pathogen for 7 to 10 days and a repeated CT scan in 4 weeks is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with ILD than pneumonia.
* Option C: Administering steroid treatment and discontinuing crizotinib and other TKI's permanently because TKI-induced interstitial lung disease is highly suspected is not appropriate because the patient's carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level decreased, which is a sign that the cancer is responding to treatment.

This is a rare, aggressive tumor that can occur in the brain, spinal cord, or other organs. It is most common in children under the age of 3. AT/RT is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the prognosis is poor.

The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with AT/RT. The tumor is located in the right eye and right parotid gland, which are common sites for AT/RT. The patient also has a history of maternal drug use, which is a risk factor for AT/RT. Additionally, the patient's tumor is showing signs of rapid growth and metastasis.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is a condition that can cause polyuria, or excessive urination. Polyuria can lead to urinary magnesium loss, which can in turn cause hypomagnesemia.

The patient's serum magnesium levels have been low for several months, despite taking magnesium supplements. This suggests that the patient is not absorbing magnesium adequately from her diet or supplements.

The patient's 24-hour urine magnesium excretion is high, which is consistent with urinary magnesium loss.

The patient's medications do not include any known causes of hypomagnesemia.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hypomagnesemia is urinary magnesium loss from polyuria due to her type 2 diabetes.

Improving the patient's glycemic control will help to reduce her polyuria and urinary magnesium loss. This should help to improve her hypomagnesemia.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A is incorrect because the patient does not have a history of alcoholism.
* Option C is incorrect because insulin does not promote magnesium reabsorption at the proximal convoluted tubule.

Amiodarone infusion therapy and implanting an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator are both treatments for arrhythmias, but they are not appropriate for this patient because she does not have an arrhythmia. Her ECG was normal, and she did not have any symptoms of an arrhythmia, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.

Treadmill stress testing is a test that is used to evaluate the heart's function during exercise. It is not appropriate for this patient because she has a history of heroin use. Heroin use can cause cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that weakens the heart muscle. Treadmill stress testing could worsen her cardiomyopathy and put her at risk of a heart attack.

The patient's history of heroin use makes it likely that she is still using drugs. Drug use can cause a variety of medical problems, including arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and seizures. It is important to rule out drug use as a cause of the patient's syncope before starting any other treatment. The best way to do this is to send a blood test for drug levels.

If the blood test shows that the patient is using drugs, then the next step would be to treat her addiction. This may involve inpatient or outpatient treatment, depending on the severity of her addiction. Once she is sober, then the next step would be to evaluate her for any underlying medical problems that may have caused her syncope.

The patient presented with generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting, which are all symptoms of organophosphate poisoning. Additionally, she had a history of travel to Cuba, where organophosphate poisoning is a common problem. The patient's laboratory tests showed a normal anion gap, which is consistent with organophosphate poisoning. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and borderline QT interval prolongation, which are also consistent with organophosphate poisoning. A urine toxicology screen was negative for common drugs of abuse, which further supports the diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning. A computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi, which is a characteristic finding in organophosphate poisoning.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Carbon monoxide poisoning is unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, such as headache, dizziness, confusion, or loss of consciousness. Additionally, the patient's laboratory tests showed a normal anion gap, which is not consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning.
* Methanol poisoning is unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms of methanol poisoning, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and visual disturbances. Additionally, the patient's laboratory tests showed a normal anion gap, which is not consistent with methanol poisoning.
* Fahr disease is unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms of Fahr disease, such as tremor, rigidity, dystonia, and seizures.

The patient has bilateral visual field defects and a history of open-angle glaucoma. The visual field defects are consistent with glaucomatous damage to the optic nerves. However, the patient's history and examination findings are also concerning for other possible causes of visual field defects, such as optic neuritis, optic nerve compression, or a mass lesion in the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to evaluate the optic nerves and brain for these possible causes.

Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat glaucoma. It is not indicated in this case because the patient's intraocular pressure is already controlled with medical therapy.

Monitoring closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing is not the best approach in this case because the patient's visual field defects are already significant and are likely to progress. MRI is the best test to evaluate the cause of the visual field defects and to determine the best course of treatment.

Reassuring the patient that her findings are consistent with longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect is not the best approach in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are concerning for other possible causes of visual field defects. MRI is the best test to evaluate the cause of the visual field defects and to determine the best course of treatment.

Chondroid syringoma is a rare benign tumor of the skin that is composed of eccrine glands and chondroid tissue. It is typically seen in adults, and most commonly presents as a solitary, painless nodule on the face or neck. The lesion is often firm and well-circumscribed, and may have a warty or papular appearance. Chondroid syringomas are typically diagnosed based on their clinical appearance and confirmed by biopsy. Treatment is typically not necessary, but excision may be performed for cosmetic or symptomatic reasons.

Scalp metastasis is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the scalp. The most common type of cancer to metastasize to the scalp is melanoma, followed by breast cancer and lung cancer. Scalp metastasis can present as a solitary nodule, multiple nodules, or a diffuse scalp mass. The lesions are typically firm and non-tender, and may be associated with alopecia. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Treatment depends on the underlying cancer and the extent of the metastasis. Options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.

Proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus is a rare condition in which a congenital melanocytic nevus (mole) develops a nodule of atypical melanocytes. This can occur in any age group, but is most common in children and young adults. The nodule is typically firm and non-tender, and may be associated with alopecia. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Treatment depends on the size and location of the nodule, as well as the patient's age and overall health. Options include excision, Mohs microsurgery, and observation.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous meningeal heterotopia. This is a rare congenital anomaly in which tissue from the meninges (the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) is present in the skin. It typically presents as a solitary, asymptomatic nodule on the scalp. The lesion is often firm and well-circumscribed, and may have a waxy or verrucous appearance. Diagnosis is typically made based on the clinical appearance and confirmed by biopsy. Treatment is not usually necessary, but excision may be performed for cosmetic or symptomatic reasons.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely for the following reasons:

* Chondroid syringoma is typically seen in adults, and most commonly presents as a solitary, painless nodule on the face or neck. The lesion in the patient is on the scalp, and is not typical for chondroid syringoma.
* Scalp metastasis is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the scalp. The most common type of cancer to metastasize to the scalp is melanoma, followed by breast cancer and lung cancer. The patient has no history of cancer, and the lesion is not typical for scalp metastasis.
* Proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus is a rare condition in which a congenital melanocytic nevus (mole) develops a nodule of atypical melanocytes. This can occur in any age group, but is most common in children and young adults. The patient is in her early 70s, and the lesion is not typical for proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus.

 20%|██        | 310/1525 [1:16:17<4:59:35, 14.79s/it]The correct answer is D. Observe periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continued.

The patient has a 25-year history of bulimia and is purging almost daily. She reported an inability to go more than 3 days at a time without purging and noted a reduction in the pressure and size of her lesions with respite from these daily episodes. This suggests that the lesions are likely secondary to her bulimia and may resolve with treatment of her underlying condition.

Sclerotherapy, surgical excision, and systemic administration of propranolol are all potential treatments for vascular lesions, but they are not appropriate in this case. Sclerotherapy and surgical excision would be invasive procedures that are not necessary in this case, as the lesions are not causing any significant problems for the patient. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including hypertension, heart disease, and anxiety. It is not a first-line treatment for vascular lesions and is not likely to be effective in this case.

The best course of management for this patient is to observe the periocular lesions while her psychiatric treatment is continued. If the lesions do not resolve with treatment of her bulimia, then further treatment options can be considered.

 20%|██        | 311/1525 [1:16:29<4:45:35, 14.11s/it]The correct answer is D: Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection.

The patient has a diffuse, multinodular tarsal mass with hairpin-shaped vessels. This is a classic presentation of sebaceous gland carcinoma, a rare but aggressive type of skin cancer. The gold standard treatment for sebaceous gland carcinoma is surgical excision with clear margins. In this case, a complete posterior lamellar resection is the best option because it allows for wide excision of the tumor while preserving the anterior lamella of the eyelid, which is important for maintaining eyelid function.

Topical interferon alfa-2b, external beam radiotherapy, and intralesional fluorouracil are all treatment options for sebaceous gland carcinoma, but they are not as effective as surgical excision. Topical interferon alfa-2b is a type of immunotherapy that can be used to treat skin cancer. It works by stimulating the body's immune system to attack the cancer cells. External beam radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that can be used to kill cancer cells. Intralesional fluorouracil is a type of chemotherapy that can be injected into a tumor. These treatments can be effective in controlling sebaceous gland carcinoma, but they are not as effective as surgical excision. Surgical excision is the only treatment that can provide a cure for sebaceous gland carcinoma.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D: Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection. This is the best option for treatment of sebaceous gland carcinoma because it allows for wide excision of the tumor while preserving the anterior lamella of the eyelid.

 20%|██        | 312/1525 [1:16:46<5:00:08, 14.85s/it]The correct answer is B. Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy.

Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy (EDH) is a rare skin condition that occurs in patients with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. The condition is characterized by a pruritic eruption of erythematous papules and plaques that are often associated with peripheral eosinophilia. The diagnosis of EDH is made based on the clinical presentation, skin biopsy findings, and hematologic workup.

The pathophysiology of EDH is not fully understood, but it is thought to be mediated by an immune reaction to antigens released by malignant cells. The condition is typically self-limited, but it can be severe and may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.

The patient in the case presented has a recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She also has a 3-week history of a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption. The eruption is composed of small indurated and edematous papules that are confluent and lead to large urticariform plaques, some with annular configuration. The eruption is present on the flanks, lower legs, breasts, and scalp. Hyperpigmented patches and focal areas of bruiselike discoloration are seen adjacent to acute lesions. Mucous membranes, palms, and soles are spared. A biopsy specimen shows a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils.

Based on the clinical presentation, skin biopsy findings, and hematologic workup, the patient's diagnosis is EDH. The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that is characterized by fever, rash, eosinophilia, and organ involvement. The patient does not have any systemic symptoms, and her organ function tests are normal.
* Urticarial vasculitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin characterized by recurrent episodes of urticarial lesions that are associated with vasculitis. The patient's lesions do not have the characteristic features of urticarial vasculitis, and her biopsy specimen does not show vasculitis.
* Urticarial bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that is characterized by the development of urticarial lesions that are associated with blisters. The patient's lesions do not have the characteristic features of urticarial bullous pemphigoid, and her biopsy specimen does not show blisters.

 21%|██        | 313/1525 [1:17:02<5:09:57, 15.34s/it]The correct answer is C. Extract the lesion surgically. The patient has a nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius, which is causing hydrocephalus. The ventriculostomy has been draining CSF and controlling her intracranial pressure, but the lesion has now moved to the fourth ventricle and is no longer being drained. This means that the lesion is likely to continue to cause hydrocephalus and neurologic deterioration if it is not removed. The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, observing the patient without intervention, would allow the lesion to continue to cause hydrocephalus and neurologic deterioration. Option B, initiating anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids, is not indicated in this case because the lesion is not caused by an infection. Option D, diverting cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt, would not address the underlying cause of the hydrocephalus and would likely require multiple shunt revisions.

The patient should undergo surgery to remove the lesion. This will relieve the obstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius and allow CSF to flow normally. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of recurrence of hydrocephalus.

 21%|██        | 314/1525 [1:17:18<5:09:46, 15.35s/it]The correct answer is C. Order a thoracic CT scan.

The patient has a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, and he has recently developed progressive exertional dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities. He also has yellow discoloration and thickening of his fingernails and toenails. These findings are consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which the pressure in the pulmonary arteries is abnormally high. This can lead to right heart failure and death.

A thoracic CT scan is the best test to diagnose pulmonary hypertension. It can show the size and shape of the heart, the size of the pulmonary arteries, and any evidence of clots or other problems. A thoracic CT scan can also be used to assess the severity of pulmonary hypertension.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the best tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension.

* Option A: Perform microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution. This test is used to diagnose fungal infections of the nails. It is not the best test to diagnose pulmonary hypertension.
* Option B: Order radiographs of hands and feet. Radiographs of the hands and feet can be used to diagnose arthritis, gout, and other bone and joint problems. They are not the best tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension.
* Option D: Order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity. These tests are used to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. They are not the best tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension.

 21%|██        | 315/1525 [1:17:34<5:16:09, 15.68s/it]The correct answer is B. Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis.

Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat a variety of cancers, including appendiceal adenocarcinoma. It works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate synthase, which is necessary for DNA synthesis. This can lead to cell death in cancer cells.

Capecitabine can also cause side effects in the gastrointestinal tract, including diarrhea. This is because capecitabine is metabolized into 5-FU, which is also an antimetabolite that can damage cells in the gastrointestinal tract.

The patient in this case has a number of features that are consistent with capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis. He has recently been diagnosed with metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma and is undergoing chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin. He has watery, large-volume diarrhea that is nonbloody and wakes him up from sleep. His diarrhea is accompanied by crampy abdominal pain and is not associated with nausea or vomiting. The diarrhea has persisted despite treatment with combinations of loperamide, atropine/diphenoxylate, colestipol, and tincture of opium. He has required repeated intravenous infusions for fluid and electrolyte repletion. His physical examination results reveal normal vital signs and a mildly tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, but no peritoneal signs. His laboratory workup results are notable for severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, as well as positive fecal lactoferrin and elevated fecal calprotectin levels of 646 μg/g. His infectious workup results are unremarkable. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis reveals diffuse long-segment wall thickening involving nearly the entire terminal ileum. An ileocolonoscopy reveals erythematous and congested mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations throughout the examined terminal ileum. Targeted biopsies were obtained.

The histopathology of the biopsies shows a non-specific inflammatory infiltrate with cryptitis and focal ulceration. There is no evidence of infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory bowel disease.

The combination of the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging and histopathologic findings is most consistent with capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis.

A. Cytomegalovirus ileitis is a less likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any other features of cytomegalovirus infection, such as fever, leukopenia, or elevated liver function tests.

C. Ileal metastasis is a less likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any other features of metastatic disease, such as weight loss, anorexia, or fever.

D. Small bowel carcinoid tumor is a less likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any other features of carcinoid syndrome, such as flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing.

 21%|██        | 316/1525 [1:17:49<5:09:15, 15.35s/it]The correct answer is D. Order brain magnetic resonance imaging.

The patient has a history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and bilateral peripheral iridotomies. She has been treated for glaucoma for approximately 1 year. Her review of systems was negative for previous episodes of eye pain, redness, or emesis. Her medical history included hyperlipidemia, obesity, and prior cataract surgery in both eyes. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. The patient’s pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg bilaterally without medication. Slitlamp findings were notable for patent peripheral iridotomies, open angles on gonioscopy, and an asymmetrically enlarged cup-disc ratio with mild pallor of the left optic nerve. Color vision was decreased in the left eye. Visual field (VF) testing as well as ganglion cell layer (GCL) segmentation by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were obtained for both eyes.

The OCT findings show nasal thinning of the right eye and diffuse thinning of the left eye. In the right eye, the relative thinning within the nasal macula compared with the temporal macula suggests injury to the papillomacular bundle. In the left eye, the diffuse thinning suggests diffuse optic nerve injury.

The patient’s history and examination findings are consistent with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. However, the diffuse thinning of the GCL on the OCT suggests a more diffuse process than would be expected with glaucoma alone. This could be due to a number of other conditions, including optic neuritis, central retinal vein occlusion, or multiple sclerosis. In order to further evaluate the cause of the patient’s visual loss, it is necessary to order a brain MRI. The MRI will help to rule out any other possible causes of the patient’s visual loss, such as a brain tumor or stroke.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinning) is incorrect because the patient’s retinal thinning is likely secondary to the glaucomatous optic neuropathy. A retina specialist would not be able to provide any additional treatment for this condition.
* Option B (Start intraocular pressure–lowering medications owing to GCL loss) is incorrect because the patient’s GCL loss is likely secondary to the glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Intraocular pressure–lowering medications would not be able to reverse this damage.
* Option C (Order a carotid doppler) is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of carotid artery disease. A carotid doppler would not be helpful in this case.

 21%|██        | 317/1525 [1:18:03<5:01:48, 14.99s/it]The correct answer is D. Initiate admission, high-dose systemic steroids, and a rheumatology consult.

The patient has scleritis and retinal detachment after strabismus surgery. Scleritis is an inflammation of the sclera, which is the white of the eye. It can be caused by a number of things, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and trauma. Retinal detachment is a separation of the retina from the back of the eye. It can be caused by a number of things, including trauma, inflammation, and tumors.

In this case, the patient has both scleritis and retinal detachment. This is a serious condition that can lead to permanent vision loss. The patient needs to be admitted to the hospital and treated with high-dose systemic steroids. Steroids help to reduce inflammation and can help to prevent the progression of the scleritis. The patient also needs to be seen by a rheumatologist to rule out an underlying autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases can cause scleritis and retinal detachment.

The other options are incorrect. Option A, giving fortified antibiotics, is incorrect because the patient does not have an infection. Option B, giving topical steroids and cycloplegia, is incorrect because the patient needs systemic steroids, not topical steroids. Option C, providing systemic corticosteroids and outpatient follow-up, is incorrect because the patient needs to be admitted to the hospital and treated with high-dose systemic steroids.

 21%|██        | 318/1525 [1:18:18<5:03:52, 15.11s/it]The correct answer is C. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.

Odontogenic keratocyst is a benign odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a cystic lesion lined by a stratified squamous epithelium with keratinization. Ameloblastoma is a locally aggressive odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelium. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is a rare, malignant odontogenic tumor that is characterized by nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. Salivary clear cell carcinoma is a rare, malignant salivary gland tumor that is characterized by nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm.

The patient in this case presented with a 4.3 × 4.0-cm radiolucent lesion in the anterior mandible with an impacted mandibular canine at the center of the lesion. The lesion was centered in the cortical bone and extended into the surrounding mucosa, fibroadipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Perineural invasion was identified, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. The tumor involved multiple margins. Immunohistochemistry findings revealed the tumor cells were positive for p40. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrated an EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 60% of the tumor cells.

The clinical and radiographic findings, as well as the histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings, are consistent with a diagnosis of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma. The presence of perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion indicates that the tumor is malignant. The EWSR1 gene rearrangement is a characteristic finding in clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.

Odontogenic keratocyst, ameloblastoma, and salivary clear cell carcinoma are all benign tumors. They do not have the aggressive clinical behavior or the malignant histopathologic features of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma. Therefore, they are not the correct diagnoses in this case.

 21%|██        | 319/1525 [1:18:34<5:11:09, 15.48s/it]The correct answer is C. Pigmented extramammary Paget disease.

The patient is a woman in her 70s who presented with an enlarged and variegated plaque on her left axilla. The lesion started as a small eczematous, pink-to-brown plaque. As the lesion was asymptomatic and slow growing, she did not initially seek treatment. Recently, the color of the lesion had changed to an alarming dark brown color. No breast mass or lymphadenopathy was observed. Her medical and family history was unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for further histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings revealed an intraepidermal neoplasm consisting of pagetoid cells, characterized by round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm, and large pleomorphic nuclei. Immunohistochemical findings showed positive staining for EMA. The lesion was surrounded by numerous reactive dendritic HMB-45–positive melanocytes scattered among the tumor cells.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is pigmented extramammary Paget disease. Pigmented extramammary Paget disease is a rare, slow-growing skin cancer that most commonly affects the anogenital region. It can also occur on the skin of the breasts, axillae, and groin. The disease is characterized by the presence of pagetoid cells, which are atypical melanocytes that are found in the epidermis. The pagetoid cells are typically positive for EMA and HMB-45.

The treatment for pigmented extramammary Paget disease depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, the treatment of choice is usually surgery. In more advanced disease, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be necessary.

The prognosis for patients with pigmented extramammary Paget disease is generally good. With early diagnosis and treatment, the cure rate is high. However, the disease can be locally aggressive and may recur after treatment. In rare cases, the disease can metastasize to other parts of the body.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pagetoid Bowen disease is a precancerous condition that is characterized by the presence of pagetoid cells in the epidermis. However, pagetoid Bowen disease does not typically present with a pigmented plaque.
* Inverse lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules. Inverse lichen planus does not typically present with a pigmented plaque.
* Superficial spreading melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by a slow-growing, flat or raised lesion with irregular borders. Superficial spreading melanoma typically does not present with a pigmented plaque.

 21%|██        | 320/1525 [1:18:51<5:16:42, 15.77s/it]The correct diagnosis is subcutaneous dirofilariasis. This is a parasitic infection caused by nematodes of the genus Dirofilaria. The most common species to infect humans is Dirofilaria repens, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The infection is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, but can also occur in temperate regions.

The clinical presentation of subcutaneous dirofilariasis varies depending on the stage of infection. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms. As the infection progresses, a nodule may develop at the site of the bite. The nodule is usually painless, but may be tender. It is often described as being skin-colored, firm, and freely mobile.

The diagnosis of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is made by biopsy of the nodule. The biopsy will show the presence of the parasite. Treatment is with surgical excision of the nodule. In some cases, it may be necessary to treat the infection with antiparasitic medications.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Onchocercoma is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted by black flies. The most common clinical presentation of onchocercoma is skin lesions, such as nodules, plaques, and rashes. Onchocercoma can also cause eye problems, such as blindness.

Cutaneous loiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Loa loa. It is transmitted by deerflies. The most common clinical presentation of cutaneous loiasis is subcutaneous swellings, known as Calabar swellings. Calabar swellings are usually painless and transient. They may be accompanied by fever, chills, and headache.

Subcutaneous hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It is transmitted by dogs and cats. The most common clinical presentation of subcutaneous hydatid cyst is a painless, slowly growing lump. The lump may be tender or itchy. It may also be associated with fever, chills, and weight loss.

 21%|██        | 321/1525 [1:19:07<5:20:50, 15.99s/it]The correct answer is A. Relapsing polychondritis.

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the cartilage in the body. It can cause inflammation and damage to the cartilage in the ears, nose, airways, eyes, joints, and heart.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a number of symptoms that are consistent with relapsing polychondritis. These include recurrent sore throat, hoarseness of voice, swelling and redness of the left ear, saddle-shaped deformity of the nose, difficulty breathing when lying supine, and elevated C-reactive protein levels.

The patient's symptoms have been present for 3 months, and he has been treated with multiple courses of oral antibiotics without improvement. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are not due to an infection.

The patient's physical examination findings, including saddle-nose deformity, left pinna perichondritis, and soft inspiratory stridor, are also consistent with relapsing polychondritis.

The laboratory test results, including elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are non-specific but support the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis.

The patient's negative results for antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies also support the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and sarcoidosis are all autoimmune disorders that can cause inflammation and damage to the cartilage in the body. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with these disorders.

GPA is a systemic vasculitis that affects the small and medium-sized arteries. It can cause inflammation and damage to the cartilage in the ears, nose, and airways. However, GPA typically also affects the kidneys and lungs. The patient in the case presentation does not have any kidney or lung involvement.

EGPA is a systemic vasculitis that affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins. It can cause inflammation and damage to the cartilage in the ears, nose, and airways. However, EGPA typically also affects the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The patient in the case presentation does not have any skin, gastrointestinal tract, or heart involvement.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes, skin, and other organs. It can cause inflammation and damage to the cartilage in the ears, nose, and airways. However, sarcoidosis typically does not cause recurrent sore throat, hoarseness of voice, or swelling and redness of the left ear.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with relapsing polychondritis. The other choices are incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with these disorders.

 21%|██        | 322/1525 [1:19:24<5:23:26, 16.13s/it]The correct answer is C. Order hemoglobin electrophoresis.

The patient's presentation is consistent with sickle cell retinopathy, which is a retinal complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell retinopathy is characterized by microvascular occlusion, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization. The most common clinical findings are vitreous hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that can be used to diagnose sickle cell disease. The test separates the different types of hemoglobin in the blood. Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S is prone to polymerization, which causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped. Sickle-shaped red blood cells are rigid and sticky, and they can block blood vessels, leading to ischemia and infarction.

Intravitreal corticosteroids are not indicated for the treatment of sickle cell retinopathy. Intravitreal corticosteroids are used to treat inflammation in the eye. Sickle cell retinopathy is not caused by inflammation, so intravitreal corticosteroids would not be effective.

A skin biopsy is not indicated for the treatment of sickle cell retinopathy. A skin biopsy is used to diagnose pseudoxanthoma elasticum, which is a rare genetic disorder that can cause neovascularization of the retina. The patient's presentation is not consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, so a skin biopsy would not be helpful.

An exchange transfusion is not indicated for the treatment of sickle cell retinopathy. An exchange transfusion is used to replace the patient's blood with blood that does not contain sickle hemoglobin. Exchange transfusions are not routinely used to treat sickle cell retinopathy, but they may be considered in patients with severe disease or in patients who are at risk for retinal detachment.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Order hemoglobin electrophoresis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that can be used to diagnose sickle cell disease, which is the most likely cause of the patient's presentation. Intravitreal corticosteroids, a skin biopsy, and an exchange transfusion are not indicated for the treatment of sickle cell retinopathy.

A. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is usually spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The most common symptoms of tuberculosis are cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Tuberculosis can also affect other parts of the body, such as the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and kidneys.

C. Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis, which is the flap of tissue that covers the windpipe. It is a medical emergency that can lead to death if not treated promptly. The most common symptoms of epiglottitis are fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and stridor (a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing).

D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the blood vessels. It can cause inflammation and damage to the lungs, kidneys, heart, and other organs. The most common symptoms of GPA are fever, fatigue, weight loss, and joint pain.

The patient in this case has a number of features that are consistent with sarcoidosis, including:

* Progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss
* Diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema
* Normal chest radiograph
* Non-necrotizing granulomas on biopsy
* Normal ACE level and ANA titer
* Negative tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay

These features suggest that the patient has a granulomatous disease, such as sarcoidosis. Tuberculosis and epiglottitis are both infectious diseases that can cause upper airway obstruction, but they would not be expected to cause the patient's other symptoms, such as dysphagia and weight loss. GPA is an autoimmune disease that can cause granulomas, but it would not be expected to have a normal ACE level or ANA titer.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is sarcoidosis.

 21%|██        | 324/1525 [1:19:58<5:34:17, 16.70s/it]The correct answer is B. Plan an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The patient is a 4-year-old girl with an asymptomatic, unilateral retinal mass. The mass is white and located in the superonasal quadrant of the right eye. It is approximately 2.5 disc diameters away from the optic nerve. There is no visible calcification or subretinal fluid. The left posterior segment is normal.

The most likely diagnosis is a retinal astrocytoma. Retinal astrocytomas are rare, but they are the most common type of primary intraocular tumor in children. They are usually benign, but they can grow and cause vision loss.

The next step in the evaluation is to obtain an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The examination under anesthesia will allow the doctor to directly visualize the mass and to biopsy it if necessary. The ultrasonography will help to determine the size and location of the mass. The MRI will help to determine the extent of the mass and to rule out other possible diagnoses.

The treatment for a retinal astrocytoma depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Small, non-growing tumors may be observed without treatment. Larger tumors or tumors that are growing may be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

The prognosis for a retinal astrocytoma is generally good. Most children with retinal astrocytomas have good visual outcomes, even if they require treatment.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Initiate a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditions is incorrect because the patient has no signs or symptoms of uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. It can cause redness, pain, and vision loss.

C. Obtain chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes is incorrect because the patient has no signs or symptoms of these conditions. Cardiac rhabdomyoma is a tumor that can occur in the heart. Kidney cysts and tumors can occur in the kidneys. Both of these conditions can be associated with neurocutaneous syndromes, which are a group of disorders that affect the skin and the nervous system.

D. Continue to monitor clinically with serial examinations is incorrect because the patient has a retinal mass that needs to be evaluated and treated.

The patient has a mobile intracardiac mass, which is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. The mass is likely to be a tumor, and it is important to remove it as soon as possible to prevent complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death.

A positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan is a useful test to rule out tumor metastasis, but it is not necessary to delay surgery while waiting for the results of the scan. Blood cultures and antibiotic therapy are not indicated in the absence of evidence of infection. Anticoagulation therapy may be helpful to prevent blood clots, but it is not a substitute for surgery.

In conclusion, the patient should undergo resection surgery as soon as possible to remove the mobile intracardiac mass.

The following are additional details on the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Choice A: Perform positron emission tomography–computed tomography to rule out tumor metastasis.

A PET-CT scan is a useful test to rule out tumor metastasis, but it is not necessary to delay surgery while waiting for the results of the scan. The patient has a mobile intracardiac mass, which is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. The mass is likely to be a tumor, and it is important to remove it as soon as possible to prevent complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death.

* Choice C: Perform blood cultures and provide antibiotic therapy.

Blood cultures and antibiotic therapy are not indicated in the absence of evidence of infection. The patient has a mobile intracardiac mass, which is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. The mass is likely to be a tumor, and it is important to remove it as soon as possible to prevent complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death.

* Choice D: Provide anticoagulation therapy only.

Anticoagulation therapy may be helpful to prevent blood clots, but it is not a substitute for surgery. The patient has a mobile intracardiac mass, which is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition.

 21%|██▏       | 326/1525 [1:20:23<4:45:07, 14.27s/it]The correct answer is C. Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF.

The patient has a history of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for 20 months before developing a diffuse pruritic eruption. The eruption persisted over the next 5 months despite treatment with up to 80 mg/d of oral prednisone. She did not report fever during this period. A shave biopsy performed while the patient was receiving systemic corticosteroids demonstrated spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate suggesting an incipient autoimmune bullous process. Results of follow-up direct immunofluorescence (DIF) performed on a sample taken 15 days after steroid discontinuation were negative. The eruption continued to worsen when the patient was not receiving systemic corticosteroids, with blisters developing 7.5 weeks after their discontinuation.

The most likely diagnosis is pembrolizumab-associated immune-mediated bullous dermatosis (pembrolizumab-AIBD). Pembrolizumab-AIBD is a rare but serious adverse effect of PD-1 inhibitors. It is characterized by a subepidermal blistering eruption that can be difficult to distinguish from other autoimmune bullous diseases. The diagnosis is made based on a combination of clinical features, histopathologic findings, and DIF results.

In this case, the patient has a history of pembrolizumab treatment and a clinical presentation consistent with pembrolizumab-AIBD. The initial shave biopsy showed spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory skin diseases. The follow-up DIF was negative, which makes pembrolizumab-AIBD less likely, but it is important to note that DIF can be negative in up to 50% of cases.

The next step in the management of this patient is to repeat the punch biopsy and perform DIF. If the biopsy shows features consistent with pembrolizumab-AIBD, the patient should be treated with systemic corticosteroids. If the biopsy is non-diagnostic, the patient should be treated with a trial of a different immunosuppressant, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.

Start a different PD-1 inhibitor is not the correct answer because the patient already has a history of pembrolizumab-associated immune-mediated bullous dermatosis. Starting another PD-1 inhibitor could worsen the patient's condition.

Provide intravenous fluids and wound care in a burn unit is not the correct answer because the patient does not have a severe blistering eruption that requires inpatient management.

Discharge with topical triamcinolone 0.5% cream is not the correct answer because topical corticosteroids are not effective in treating pembrolizumab-AIBD.

 21%|██▏       | 327/1525 [1:20:38<4:51:18, 14.59s/it]The correct answer is C. No stenosis or plaque. Because of high negative predictive value, no further testing is necessary.

The patient in this case has a 20% pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). She underwent coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, which showed no stenosis or plaque. This means that she has a very low risk of having CAD. The negative predictive value of CT angiography for CAD is high, meaning that a negative result is very reliable. In other words, there is a very low chance that the patient has CAD even though the CT angiography did not show any stenosis or plaque.

Therefore, no further testing is necessary. The patient can be reassured that she does not have CAD and that her chest pain is likely not due to a heart problem.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A is incorrect because there is no need to recommend a follow-up CT and perfusion imaging if the CT angiography already showed no stenosis or plaque.
* Choice B is incorrect because there is no need to recommend further functional testing if the CT angiography already showed no stenosis or plaque.
* Choice D is incorrect because there is no need to recommend invasive coronary angiography if the CT angiography already showed no stenosis or plaque.

Cancer-associated PPP syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis. It is often associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly pancreatic cancer. The symptoms of PPP syndrome typically develop over a period of weeks or months and may include fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, joint pain, and skin lesions.

The diagnosis of PPP syndrome is based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests and imaging studies. The mainstay of treatment for PPP syndrome is corticosteroids, although other immunosuppressive agents may also be used. The prognosis for patients with PPP syndrome is variable, depending on the underlying malignancy.

A. Cancer-associated systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. It is not associated with pancreatitis, panniculitis, or polyarthritis.

C. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the skin and muscles. It is not associated with pancreatitis, panniculitis, or polyarthritis.

 22%|██▏       | 329/1525 [1:21:00<4:18:15, 12.96s/it]The correct answer is C. Advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a diagnosis that is supported by the findings of magnetic resonance imaging and venography, lumbar puncture, complete blood cell count, and serum protein electrophoresis. The elevated opening pressure, elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count, and severe anemia are all consistent with IIH. The lymphocytosis with predominantly atypical lymphocytes and elevated IgM level are suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome, which can be a complication of IIH.

The mainstay of treatment for IIH is to lower the intracranial pressure. This can be achieved with acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, or corticosteroids. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to decompress the brain.

In the patient's case, urgent plasmapheresis is indicated to remove the paraneoplastic antibodies that are causing the optic nerve edema and retinal findings. Plasmapheresis is a procedure in which plasma, the liquid component of blood, is removed and replaced with plasma from a healthy donor or a synthetic plasma substitute. Plasmapheresis is effective in lowering the levels of paraneoplastic antibodies and can improve the visual and neurological function of patients with IIH.

In consultation with oncology, a decision can be made about whether to start chemotherapy or radiation therapy to treat the underlying cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are effective in killing cancer cells, but they can also damage healthy cells. The risks and benefits of these treatments should be carefully considered before starting treatment.

A is incorrect because intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are not indicated for the treatment of IIH. VEGF injections are used to treat age-related macular degeneration, a condition that is not present in this patient.

B is incorrect because empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals are not indicated for the treatment of IIH. These medications are used to treat infections, but there is no evidence of infection in this patient.

D is incorrect because a hypercoagulability workup is not indicated for the treatment of IIH. Hypercoagulability is a condition that increases the risk of blood clots, but there is no evidence of blood clots in this patient.

A juxtafacet cyst is a type of synovial cyst that occurs near a facet joint. Facet joints are located between the vertebrae in the spine. These cysts are usually caused by degeneration of the facet joint, which can lead to inflammation and pain.

Mucus retention cysts are small, fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the lining of the throat. They are usually caused by inflammation or infection of the throat.

Tornwaldt cysts are rare, congenital cysts that develop in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose. They are thought to be caused by a blockage of the opening between the nasopharynx and the eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the throat.

Spinal bronchogenic cysts are rare, congenital cysts that develop in the spinal cord. They are thought to be caused by abnormal development of the lung buds during fetal development.

The patient in this case has a pharyngeal cyst that extends to the atlantoaxial joint. This is consistent with a diagnosis of juxtafacet cyst. The other choices are not consistent with the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Mucus retention cysts are usually small and asymptomatic. They are often found incidentally on imaging studies. When they are symptomatic, they can cause pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

Tornwaldt cysts are usually asymptomatic. They are often found incidentally on imaging studies. When they are symptomatic, they can cause headache, neck pain, and hearing loss.

Spinal bronchogenic cysts are usually asymptomatic. They are often found incidentally on imaging studies. When they are symptomatic, they can cause back pain, radiculopathy, and myelopathy.

 22%|██▏       | 331/1525 [1:21:33<4:55:56, 14.87s/it]The correct answer is "Observe until repeated incident." This is because the patient is experiencing non-traumatic transient vision loss, which is a common symptom of a number of conditions, including microvascular ischemia, optic neuritis, and retinal detachment. These conditions can be serious, but they are also often benign and self-limiting. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient and see if the vision loss recurs. If it does, then further testing and treatment can be pursued.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Photocoagulate lesions with argon laser at slitlamp evaluation: This is a treatment option for diabetic retinopathy, which is a condition that is not present in this patient.
* Administer intravitreal bevacizumab injections: This is a treatment option for macular edema, which is a condition that is not present in this patient.
* Perform iridocyclectomy to excise the lesions: This is a surgical procedure that is used to treat a number of conditions, including iris tumors and glaucoma. It is not indicated for the treatment of the patient's condition.

In conclusion, the correct answer is "Observe until repeated incident." This is because the patient is experiencing non-traumatic transient vision loss, which is a common symptom of a number of conditions, including microvascular ischemia, optic neuritis, and retinal detachment.

* The patient is a 19-year-old White woman, which is the typical age and demographic for IgG4-related disease.
* The patient presents with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity. These are all common symptoms of IgG4-related disease.
* The patient's immune workup showed elevated complement C3 and total hemolytic complement levels, which are consistent with IgG4-related disease.
* Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. This suggests that the patient may have had an infection, which can trigger IgG4-related disease.
* Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. This is in contrast to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which can cause destructive lesions in the paranasal sinuses.
* Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils, and increased IgG4 absolute count. These are all characteristic findings of IgG4-related disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare, multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, lungs, skin, and other organs. It is not typically associated with nasal symptoms.
* Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis is a rare, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes into blood vessels and surrounding tissues. It is not typically associated with nasal symptoms.

The patient in this case has a clinical picture consistent with eosinophilic myocarditis, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of asthma, which is a risk factor for eosinophilic myocarditis, as well as her laboratory findings, which show an elevated eosinophil count and troponin level. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings are also consistent with eosinophilic myocarditis, showing foci of delayed mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement, diffuse pericardial thickening, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a small pericardial effusion.

The treatment of eosinophilic myocarditis is supportive and includes high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose NSAIDs. Steroids are used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Colchicine is a medication that helps to prevent the formation of blood clots. NSAIDs help to reduce inflammation and pain. The patient should be hospitalized for close monitoring and treatment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Placing a percutaneous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery is not indicated in this patient because she does not have coronary artery disease.
* Option B: Starting colchicine and NSAIDs, with outpatient follow-up in 4 weeks, is not adequate treatment for eosinophilic myocarditis. The patient requires hospitalization and treatment with high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose NSAIDs.
* Option D: Urgently draining pericardial effusion percutaneously is not indicated in this patient because the pericardial effusion is small and does not require treatment.

 22%|██▏       | 334/1525 [1:22:24<5:19:46, 16.11s/it]The correct answer is B. Erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides.

Erythema gyratum repens is a rare, rapidly progressive, annular eruption that is often associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly lung adenocarcinoma. The eruption typically begins as a single annular lesion that enlarges centrifugally, with central clearing. The lesions may be erythematous, scaling, or scaly-crusty. They may also be associated with pruritus, fever, and weight loss.

Mycosis fungoides is a rare, chronic, T-cell lymphoma that primarily affects the skin. The initial lesions of mycosis fungoides are often small, pink or red patches that may be mistaken for eczema or psoriasis. Over time, the lesions may enlarge and coalesce to form plaques or tumors. The skin lesions of mycosis fungoides may also be associated with pruritus, lymphadenopathy, and fever.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 60s who presented with a widespread, intermittently pruritic eruption. Examination showed coalescing annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques in a concentric pattern diffusely involving the chest, back, and abdomen with extension to proximal extremities. Punch biopsies from the chest and back were obtained for histopathology and tissue culture. Treatment with topical corticosteroids under wet dressings was associated with partial improvement in the eruption and pruritus.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides. The histopathology of the skin biopsy shows epidermal hyperplasia with spongiosis and parakeratosis, a superficial dermal and epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes focally distributed along the dermal-epidermal junction and aggregated in Pautrier microabscesses, and a CD30 immunohistochemical stain highlighting atypical lymphocytes. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer choice A, erythema gyratum repens associated with lung adenocarcinoma, is incorrect because the patient does not have a history of lung cancer.
* Answer choice C, erythema gyratum repens associated with pityriasis rubra pilaris, is incorrect because the patient does not have the characteristic skin lesions of pityriasis rubra pilaris, which are large, scaly, erythematous plaques that often involve the scalp, face, and trunk.
* Answer choice D, tinea imbricata, is incorrect because the patient does not have the characteristic skin lesions of tinea imbricata, which are large, annular, scaly plaques with a "tiled" appearance.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with sickle cell disease, a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Sickle cell disease can cause a number of problems, including anemia, pain, and stroke. The patient's iris atrophy and transillumination defects are also consistent with sickle cell disease.

Anterior segment fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a dye to visualize the blood vessels in the front of the eye. It is not necessary in this case, as the patient's history and physical examination are already highly suggestive of sickle cell disease.

Aqueous tap is a procedure in which a small sample of fluid is removed from the anterior chamber of the eye. This fluid can be tested for a variety of conditions, including infection and glaucoma. However, aqueous tap is not necessary in this case, as the patient's history and physical examination are already highly suggestive of sickle cell disease.

Genetic testing is a test that looks for changes in genes. It can be used to diagnose a variety of genetic disorders, including sickle cell disease. However, genetic testing is not necessary in this case, as the patient's history and physical examination are already highly suggestive of sickle cell disease.

A schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. Schwannomas are most commonly found in the peripheral nervous system, but they can also occur in the central nervous system. Schwannomas are usually slow-growing tumors that do not spread to other parts of the body.

A paraganglioma is a tumor that arises from paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are found in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Paragangliomas are usually benign tumors, but they can be malignant.

A persistent trigeminal artery is a rare congenital anomaly in which the trigeminal artery persists into adulthood. The trigeminal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that normally regresses during fetal development. If the trigeminal artery persists, it can cause symptoms such as headache, facial pain, and seizures.

A persistent hypoglossal artery is a rare congenital anomaly in which the hypoglossal artery persists into adulthood. The hypoglossal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that normally regresses during fetal development. If the hypoglossal artery persists, it can cause symptoms such as headache, facial pain, and seizures.

In the case of the 62-year-old man with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, the imaging results revealed an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath. This finding is most consistent with a persistent hypoglossal artery. A persistent hypoglossal artery is a rare congenital anomaly, but it is the most common cause of an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not associated with an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath.

The patient's symptoms and findings are concerning for a vasculitis of the central nervous system (CNS), such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes, skin, joints, kidneys, and brain. The typical presentation of SLE includes fever, rash, joint pain, and fatigue. However, the disease can present with a wide range of symptoms, depending on which organs are involved.

In the patient's case, the presence of diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages, temporal retinal neovascularization, macular traction and striae, peripheral vascular sheathing, and retinal capillary nonperfusion is concerning for a vasculitis of the CNS. These findings are consistent with the retinal findings seen in patients with SLE.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient would be to perform an MRI and MRA of the brain. This imaging study can help to identify any evidence of inflammation or damage to the CNS. If there is evidence of vasculitis on the MRI or MRA, the patient would likely be started on treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Observe the patient. This is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and findings are concerning for a serious condition, such as SLE. The patient needs to be evaluated and treated promptly.
* Option C: Perform a vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction. This is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with a viral infection of the eye.
* Option D: Administer an intravitreal injection of foscarnet. This is not the correct answer because foscarnet is a medication that is used to treat viral infections of the eye. The patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with a viral infection of the eye.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can lead to vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of the epithelial cells, including the cells of the conjunctiva. A deficiency in vitamin A can lead to keratinization of the conjunctiva, as seen in this patient.

In addition to testing for vitamin A deficiency, it is also important to perform conjunctival biopsies to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as an immune-mediated condition or a neoplasm. The biopsies can be evaluated for the presence of immune deposits or tumor cells.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: Starting treatment with frequent artificial tears 4 times daily and following up in 6 months would not be the best initial management for this patient. The patient's symptoms are severe and warrant further evaluation.
* Choice C: Observing after stopping brimonidine-timolol drops without further intervention or evaluation would not be the best initial management for this patient. The patient's symptoms are severe and warrant further evaluation.
* Choice D: Performing extensive excision of the lesion with ocular surface reconstruction, followed by disposal of the biopsy specimen would be an extreme measure that is not warranted at this time. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant this type of surgery.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects the small- and medium-sized arteries. It is characterized by necrotizing granulomas in the lungs, kidneys, and upper respiratory tract. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of GPA, such as fever, cough, hemoptysis, or glomerulonephritis. In addition, her laboratory evaluation does not reveal any evidence of inflammation, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Therefore, GPA is not the correct diagnosis.

Cryptococcal infection is a fungal infection that most commonly affects the lungs. It can also spread to the central nervous system, skin, and other organs. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of cryptococcal infection, such as fever, cough, headache, or meningismus. In addition, her laboratory evaluation does not reveal any evidence of cryptococcal infection, such as a positive cryptococcal antigen test or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Therefore, cryptococcal infection is not the correct diagnosis.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, self-limited, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and tender, erythematous skin lesions. It is often associated with underlying malignancy or medications, such as propylthiouracil, penicillamine, and dapsone. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of Sweet syndrome, such as fever, neutrophilia, or tender, erythematous skin lesions. In addition, her laboratory evaluation does not reveal any evidence of underlying malignancy. Therefore, Sweet syndrome is not the correct diagnosis.

Drug-induced vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is caused by a reaction to a medication. It can affect any blood vessel in the body, but it most commonly affects the small-sized vessels in the skin. The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for drug-induced vasculitis, including her age, the fact that she is taking multiple medications, and the presence of necrotic skin lesions. In addition, her laboratory evaluation reveals evidence of inflammation, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Therefore, drug-induced vasculitis is the most likely diagnosis.

The patient has a 15-year history of dull midline lower back pain associated with bilateral hip pain. He also noted bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes. Family history was notable for a brother with osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the loss of cartilage and the formation of osteophytes (bone spurs). It is the most common form of arthritis, affecting approximately 27 million adults in the United States.

The patient's laboratory tests show that his ferritin level is 10 ng/mL (normal range is 12-300 ng/mL) and his transferrin saturation is 10% (normal range is 20-45%). These findings suggest that the patient has iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is a common condition that occurs when the body does not have enough iron to produce healthy red blood cells. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness.

The patient's plain radiographs of the hands and pelvis show hook-like osteophytes at the second and third MCP joints bilaterally as well as asymmetric joint swelling in multiple MCP and PIP joints. A plain radiograph of the pelvis shows sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints as well as joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

The patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The next step in management is to treat the patient's iron deficiency anemia. This can be done with oral iron supplements or with intravenous iron therapy. The patient should also be treated for his osteoarthritis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or topical pain relievers. He may also benefit from physical therapy and assistive devices such as a cane or walker.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Check rheumatoid factor (RF): RF is an antibody that is often present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis and can be found in other conditions, such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, checking RF would not be helpful in the diagnosis of this patient's condition.
* C. Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joint: MRI is a diagnostic test that can be used to evaluate the sacroiliac joints. However, it is not necessary in the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the sacroiliac joints. Plain radiographs are usually sufficient to diagnose this condition.
* D. Refer for surgical consultation: Surgery is not usually indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pain or to correct deformity. However, this is not the case for this patient.

The patient is a 31-year-old woman with a history of a childhood heart murmur that was never evaluated. She presents with decreased exercise tolerance due to shortness of breath for the past 2 weeks, no chest pain, and heart palpitations a few times per week. On examination, she has a fixed split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. An electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous congestion. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle; results of contrast echocardiography are negative.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes right ventricular cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease. Cardiac MRI is the most accurate test to evaluate the right ventricle and pulmonary vasculature. It can also be used to assess for congenital heart defects. Cardiac MRI is non-invasive and does not require contrast dye.

Starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) is not the correct next step in this patient's management. ACE inhibitors are used to treat left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but they are not indicated for right ventricular dysfunction.

Performing cardiac catheterization is not the correct next step in this patient's management. Cardiac catheterization is a invasive procedure that is used to assess the coronary arteries and cardiac function. It is not indicated in this patient who does not have chest pain or evidence of coronary artery disease.

Referring to a pulmonologist is not the correct next step in this patient's management. Pulmonary hypertension is a possible diagnosis in this patient, but it is not the most likely diagnosis. Cardiac MRI is the most appropriate test to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension.

In conclusion, the correct next step in the management of this patient is to order cardiac MRI.

Chloroma is a rare type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that presents with green-gray skin lesions. It is most common in people with AML who have undergone an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The lesions are caused by the accumulation of abnormal myeloid cells in the skin.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not associated with green-gray skin lesions. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that can present with a variety of skin lesions, but it is not typically green-gray.

Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia (EHI) is a rare, multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, recurrent infections, and inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS). The diagnosis of EHI is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

The clinical presentation of EHI is variable and can range from mild to severe. Common symptoms include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and seizures. CNS involvement can manifest as seizures, encephalopathy, and cranial nerve palsies.

Laboratory findings in EHI typically include elevated serum IgE levels, eosinophilia, and hypoalbuminemia. Imaging studies may show evidence of CNS inflammation, such as white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The treatment of EHI is with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The prognosis for patients with EHI is variable, but most patients respond well to treatment.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by eosinophilia, granuloma formation, and necrotizing vasculitis. The clinical presentation of Churg-Strauss syndrome can overlap with that of EHI, but Churg-Strauss syndrome is more likely to involve the lungs and kidneys.
* C. Lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system. The clinical presentation of lymphoma can vary depending on the type and stage of disease. Lymphoma is not typically associated with elevated IgE levels or CNS involvement.
* D. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The clinical presentation of sarcoidosis can vary depending on the organs involved. Sarcoidosis is not typically associated with elevated IgE levels or CNS involvement.

The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension for 10 years, which is a risk factor for aortic aneurysm. The patient also has new-onset dyspnea associated with cough and fever, which could be signs of an aortic dissection. A barium esophagram was performed to evaluate the dysphagia, but it did not show any abnormalities. A computed tomography angiography of the aorta is the best test to evaluate the aorta for an aneurysm or dissection. A transesophageal echocardiogram is a good test to evaluate the heart, but it is not as good as a computed tomography angiography of the aorta for evaluating the aorta. Right and left heart catheterization is a good test to evaluate the heart, but it is not as good as a computed tomography angiography of the aorta for evaluating the aorta.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* **A. Perform endoscopy to rule out esophageal and pulmonary tuberculosis**

Endoscopy is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube with a camera into the esophagus to look for abnormalities. This test can be used to rule out esophageal and pulmonary tuberculosis, but it is not as good as a computed tomography angiography of the aorta for evaluating the aorta.

* **B. Perform transesophageal echocardiogram**

A transesophageal echocardiogram is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a small ultrasound probe into the esophagus to look at the heart. This test can be used to evaluate the heart, but it is not as good as a computed tomography angiography of the aorta for evaluating the aorta.

* **C. Perform computed tomography angiography of the aorta**

A computed tomography angiography of the aorta is a test that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the aorta. This test is the best test to evaluate the aorta for an aneurysm or dissection.

* **D. Perform right and left heart catheterization**

Right and left heart catheterization is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube into a vein or artery to measure the pressure in the heart and lungs. This test can be used to evaluate the heart, but it is not as good as a computed tomography angiography of the aorta for evaluating the aorta.

The patient has corneal edema, which is swelling of the cornea. This can be caused by a number of things, including trauma, infection, and inflammation. In this case, the corneal edema is likely due to inflammation caused by the plant latex.

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that can help to reduce the swelling of the cornea. They are also effective in treating the other symptoms of inflammation, such as redness, irritation, and blurred vision.

Topical corticosteroid eyedrops are the most common way to administer corticosteroids to the eye. They are safe and effective when used as directed.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for corneal edema caused by plant latex.

Intrastromal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is not a treatment for corneal edema.

Oral and/or topical antiviral medications are used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. They are not effective in treating corneal edema caused by plant latex.

Endothelial keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that is used to treat corneal edema that is caused by endothelial cell loss. It is not a treatment for corneal edema caused by plant latex.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Start topical corticosteroid eyedrops.

 23%|██▎       | 346/1525 [1:25:20<4:58:43, 15.20s/it]The correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck. The patient has a history of hypertension and recent onset of left-sided facial pain. These symptoms are concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis that can affect the cranial arteries. GCA can cause ptosis, which is drooping of the upper eyelid. Other symptoms of GCA can include headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual loss.

An edrophonium test is a diagnostic test used to assess for myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder that can cause ptosis. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with myasthenia gravis.

Oculoplastic referral for ptosis repair is a treatment option for ptosis, but it is not the appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's ptosis is likely due to GCA, which requires treatment with corticosteroids.

Sumatriptan injection is a medication used to treat migraine headaches. The patient does not have a history of migraine headaches, and his facial pain is likely due to GCA. Sumatriptan injection would not be effective in treating GCA.

Therefore, the correct next step in the management of this patient is to order an MRA of the brain and neck to evaluate for GCA. If GCA is diagnosed, the patient will need to be treated with corticosteroids.

 23%|██▎       | 347/1525 [1:25:37<5:05:28, 15.56s/it]The correct answer is B. Mastocytoma.

A histiocytoma is a rare type of tumor that can occur in any part of the body. It is usually benign, but it can sometimes be malignant. Histiocytomas are made up of cells called histiocytes, which are a type of white blood cell.

A malignant pheochromocytoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys. They produce hormones that help the body regulate blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar levels.

A myeloid sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that produces blood cells. Myeloid sarcomas are usually aggressive and can spread to other parts of the body.

In this case, the patient presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass. Computed tomography–guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass revealed a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm.

The history of back and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and flushing is consistent with a mast cell disorder. Mast cells are cells that release chemicals that can cause inflammation and allergic reactions. The flushing and vomiting that occurred immediately following the abdominal ultrasonography is a classic presentation of mast cell activation syndrome.

The imaging findings of a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass are also consistent with a mastocytoma. Mastocytomas are tumors that are made up of mast cells. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin.

The histopathologic findings of a dense cellular infiltrate composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm are also consistent with a mastocytoma. Mast cells are round cells with a characteristic appearance on histopathology. They have a large nucleus and abundant cytoplasm that is often filled with granules.

Based on the history, imaging, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is a mastocytoma. The other choices are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

 23%|██▎       | 348/1525 [1:25:53<5:10:38, 15.84s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform a transscleral subretinal biopsy.

The patient in the case presented has a history of cystic fibrosis and underwent bilateral lung transplant four weeks ago. He then developed acute vision loss in the left eye. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum intravenous and intravitreal antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, but his visual acuity and intraocular inflammation worsened. Over a week, the areas of retinal whitening became elevated owing to enlarging subretinal infiltrates. A pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy was performed in the left eye, but the microbiological analysis including culture and PCR analysis was inconclusive. The patient's pain worsened, intraocular pressure elevated, visual acuity waned to no light perception, and intraocular inflammation and subretinal infiltrates continued to worsen, producing nearly closed funnel retinal detachments in both eyes.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a fungal infection of the retina. The patient's history of cystic fibrosis and recent lung transplant place him at increased risk for fungal infections. The patient's clinical presentation, including the presence of retinal whitening, subretinal infiltrates, and intraocular inflammation, is also consistent with a fungal infection.

The treatment of choice for a fungal infection of the retina is systemic antifungal therapy. However, in this case, the patient's intraocular inflammation has worsened despite treatment with broad-spectrum antifungals. This suggests that the infection is resistant to the antifungals that have been used. In this situation, it is necessary to obtain a tissue biopsy to identify the specific fungal organism and to determine the most effective antifungal therapy.

A transscleral subretinal biopsy is the procedure of choice for obtaining a tissue biopsy of the retina. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. A small incision is made in the sclera, the white of the eye, and a needle is inserted into the subretinal space. A small piece of tissue is then removed from the subretinal space and sent for pathological examination.

The transscleral subretinal biopsy is a safe and effective procedure. The complication rate is low, and the procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis. The benefits of performing the procedure outweigh the risks, as it is the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis of a fungal infection of the retina and to determine the most effective antifungal therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy would increase the risk of the patient developing a systemic fungal infection.
* Continuing intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications would not be effective, as the patient's infection is resistant to these medications.
* Repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy in the left eye would not be effective, as the patient's infection is resistant to the antifungals that have been used.

 23%|██▎       | 349/1525 [1:26:08<5:04:03, 15.51s/it]The correct diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a chronic skin infection caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected sand flies. The most common symptom is a single, raised, red or brown skin lesion that may ulcerate. The lesion may persist for months or years without treatment.

Herpetic whitlow is a common viral infection of the fingers or toes. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The most common symptom is a painful, fluid-filled blister on the finger or toe. The blister may burst and form a crust. Herpetic whitlow is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2-4 weeks.

Bacterial paronychia is an infection of the skin around the nail. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The most common symptom is pain, redness, and swelling of the skin around the nail. The nail may become loose or separated from the nail bed. Bacterial paronychia is usually treated with antibiotics.

Pyogenic granuloma is a benign skin lesion that is often caused by trauma. It is characterized by a rapidly growing, red, fleshy mass that bleeds easily. Pyogenic granuloma is usually treated by surgical removal.

In the case presented, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient is a young girl who lives in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast. She has a 7-month history of an inflammatory plaque on her left index finger that has not responded to treatment with antibiotics or antivirals. The lesion is described as a raised, red or brown skin lesion that may ulcerate. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Herpetic whitlow is less likely in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection, such as fever or cold sores. Bacterial paronychia is also less likely because the patient does not have any history of trauma to the finger. Pyogenic granuloma is a less likely diagnosis because it is usually caused by trauma and the patient does not have any history of trauma to the finger.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous leishmaniasis.

 23%|██▎       | 350/1525 [1:26:22<4:58:22, 15.24s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA.

The patient in the case report developed anterior chamber inflammation six weeks after DMEK. The inflammation was associated with new KPs in coin-shaped aggregates, increased intraocular pressure, and negative donor rim culture results for mycobacteria, fungus, and bacteria, including Propionibacterium acnes. These findings are consistent with CMV endotheliitis.

CMV endotheliitis is a common cause of graft failure after DMEK. It is caused by reactivation of latent CMV infection in the donor cornea. The diagnosis is made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of aqueous humor for CMV DNA. Treatment is with ganciclovir or foscarnet.

Increasing the frequency or potency of steroids is not the correct answer because it will not treat the underlying infection. In fact, it may worsen the inflammation.

Performing a vitreous tap with intravitreal antibiotic injection is not the correct answer because it is not indicated for CMV endotheliitis. Intravitreal antibiotics are used to treat bacterial endophthalmitis, not viral infections.

Initiating empirical treatment with acyclovir is not the correct answer because it is not effective against CMV. Acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, not CMV infections.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Obtain polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA.

 23%|██▎       | 351/1525 [1:26:38<5:00:39, 15.37s/it]The correct answer is C. Sinonasal meningioma.

Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. It is typically seen in young adults and is more common in men than women. Esthesioneuroblastoma is often aggressive and can spread to the brain and other parts of the body.

Pott puffy tumor is a benign tumor that arises from the dura mater, the membrane that covers the brain. It is typically seen in children and young adults and is more common in men than women. Pott puffy tumor is often asymptomatic and is usually discovered incidentally on imaging studies.

Sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the neuroendocrine cells in the nasal cavity. It is typically seen in adults and is more common in men than women. Sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma is often aggressive and can spread to the brain and other parts of the body.

In the case presented, the patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of arthritis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and glaucoma. She presented to the clinic for evaluation of chronic sinusitis. Symptoms included a several-year history of frontal pain, pressure, clear nasal discharge, and progressive nontender facial swelling above her glabella. She denied nasal disturbance, prior sinus surgery, asthma, or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) sensitivity. Symptoms were refractory to treatment with several rounds of oral antibiotics and oral steroids. Physical examination findings revealed symmetric facial movement with prominent glabellar swelling and soft tissue thickening. Nasal endoscopy findings revealed a soft tissue mass anterior to the axilla of the middle turbinates bilaterally, with normal-appearing mucosa overlying. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for further evaluation. The MRI scan showed a hyperintense soft tissue mass on anterior septum with extension into frontal sinus. Adjacent soft tissue thickening noted on skin overlying frontal sinus and nasal bones. No intracranial extension noted. Hematoxylin-eosin stain (original magnification ×10) results showed lobules of neoplastic cells with whorled architecture. Hematoxylin-eosin stain (original magnification ×20) results showed intranuclear inclusions.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathology results are all consistent with a diagnosis of sinonasal meningioma. Sinonasal meningiomas are the most common type of meningioma in the sinonasal cavity. They are typically slow-growing and benign. However, they can occasionally be aggressive and can spread to the brain and other parts of the body.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathology results.

The patient had a history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells that line the mouth and throat. He was treated with radiation therapy and cetuximab, which are both treatments for squamous cell carcinoma. However, he developed a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node, which is a sign that the cancer has spread. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy, which further supports the diagnosis of metastatic cancer. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe, which is consistent with metastatic disease to the thyroid. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1). These findings are all consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer. It is usually slow-growing and has a good prognosis. Thyroid lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the thyroid gland. It is rare, but it can be aggressive. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the most aggressive type of thyroid cancer. It is rare, but it is often fatal.

In the case of this patient, the history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy findings all support the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation.

 23%|██▎       | 353/1525 [1:27:08<4:55:53, 15.15s/it]The correct answer is A. Diagnose the patient with PAD and begin medical management.

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with exertional left calf discomfort. She has no history of spinal degenerative disease and does not have lower extremity arterial bruits, wounds, sensory deficits, edema, or hair loss. Results of an exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test show an ABI of 0.6 bilaterally.

An ABI of less than 0.9 is consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a condition in which the arteries that carry blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This can cause pain, cramping, and fatigue in the legs, especially when walking or exercising.

The most common cause of PAD is atherosclerosis, a build-up of plaque in the arteries. Atherosclerosis can be caused by a number of factors, including age, smoking, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

The treatment for PAD depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly may be enough to control the symptoms. In more severe cases, medications or surgery may be necessary to improve blood flow to the legs.

In this case, the patient has a history of hypertension and an ABI of less than 0.9. This suggests that she has PAD. The next step is to confirm the diagnosis with an additional test, such as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) or a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient should be referred to a vascular specialist for treatment.

The incorrect answers are as follows:

B. Order a lower extremity angiogram. An angiogram is a procedure that uses X-rays to view the arteries in the legs. It is not necessary to order an angiogram in this case because the diagnosis of PAD has already been made with an ABI test.

C. Order a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound. A duplex ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to view the arteries in the legs. It is not necessary to order a duplex ultrasound in this case because the diagnosis of PAD has already been made with an ABI test.

D. Reassure the patient that her pain is nonvascular in origin. The patient's pain is likely caused by PAD. Reassuring her that her pain is nonvascular in origin would be incorrect and could delay her diagnosis and treatment.

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of uterine carcinoma (unknown histology) diagnosed and treated 30 years prior with hysterectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy in another country. She presents with 2 months of generalized abdominal pain and distention. She had no fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in the stool, or weight loss. She was not taking any medications. On examination, her temperature was 36.9 °C; heart rate, 72/min; blood pressure, 132/68 mm Hg; and body mass index, 25 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Results of complete blood cell count and serum chemistries were unremarkable, with no leukocytosis and normal differential count. Abdominal examination demonstrated mild distention without fluid wave and mild right lower abdomen and suprapubic tenderness. Computed tomography (Figure 1) and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum. Two attempts at ultrasound-guided paracentesis were nondiagnostic because of acellular specimens. Serum CA-125 level was normal; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 18 ng/mL (reference, <5 ng/mL).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes appendicitis, carcinomatosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with appendicitis. The CT scan and MRI findings are also consistent with appendicitis. The CA-125 level is normal, which makes carcinomatosis less likely. The CEA level is elevated, but this could be due to the patient's history of uterine carcinoma.

The next step in management is to perform laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B: Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology. This would not provide any additional information, as the previous paracentesis was nondiagnostic.
* C: Order colonoscopy with biopsy. This would be appropriate if the patient had a history of inflammatory bowel disease, but the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* D: Order broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic enteric species. This would be appropriate if the patient had a confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis, but the patient's diagnosis is not yet confirmed.

 23%|██▎       | 355/1525 [1:27:38<4:54:55, 15.12s/it]The correct answer is A. Sporotrichosis.

The patient is an older adult with a history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury. The medical history was unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems were negative. The patient had been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion had continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts. Lymphadenopathy was not identified. Punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed, with representative sections shown.

The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with sporotrichosis, a fungal infection that is most commonly acquired through contact with soil or plant material that is contaminated with the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. The infection typically presents as a single, painless skin lesion that begins as a papule or nodule and then enlarges to form a plaque or ulcer. The lesion may be associated with lymphadenopathy and fever.

The histopathologic findings of sporotrichosis are characteristic and include a suppurative granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleate giant cells. The diagnosis can be confirmed by culture of the fungus from the lesion.

The treatment of sporotrichosis is with antifungal medications, such as itraconazole or fluconazole. The prognosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris is a type of psoriasis that occurs in response to trauma to the skin. The patient's history does not suggest that the lesion is psoriasis.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest that he has granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
* Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest that he has sarcoidosis.

 23%|██▎       | 356/1525 [1:27:54<4:57:03, 15.25s/it]The correct answer is C: Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). The patient in this case has experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a high-grade distal left main coronary artery (LM) bifurcation lesion. Despite initial resuscitation efforts, the patient remains in asystole. In this situation, VA ECMO is the most appropriate next step in management.

VA ECMO provides cardiopulmonary support by bypassing the heart and lungs. Blood is drained from the patient's venous system, oxygenated in an artificial lung, and then returned to the patient's arterial system. This allows the patient's heart and lungs to rest and recover. VA ECMO is a life-saving therapy that can be used to bridge patients to definitive treatment, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart transplantation.

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this situation. A percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a mechanical pump that can be used to support the failing left ventricle. However, an LVAD is not indicated in this patient because he has already experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest. Pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion is a procedure that is used to drain blood from the pericardial sac. However, this procedure is not likely to be helpful in this patient because he has already experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest. Root and ascending aortography is a procedure that is used to visualize the aortic root and ascending aorta. However, this procedure is not likely to be helpful in this patient because he has already experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. VA ECMO is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient because it provides cardiopulmonary support while his heart and lungs rest and recover.

It is a common finding in the larynx, and is usually not associated with any symptoms. In this case, the patient presented with a 1-year history of dysphonia, which was thought to be due to chondroid metaplasia of the left vocal fold. A direct laryngoscopy revealed a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold. A biopsy of the lesion showed fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chondroid metaplasia.

Saccular cyst is a type of cyst that can occur in the larynx. It is a fluid-filled sac that is usually located on the vocal fold. Saccular cysts are usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause hoarseness or other voice problems. In this case, the patient did not have any history of hoarseness or other voice problems, so a saccular cyst is not a likely diagnosis.

Chondroma is a benign tumor that is made up of cartilage. It can occur in any part of the body, including the larynx. Chondromas are usually slow-growing and non-cancerous. In this case, the patient's lesion was small and did not have any features of malignancy, so a chondroma is a possible diagnosis. However, the lack of nuclear atypia or mitosis in the biopsy specimen makes chondroma less likely than chondroid metaplasia.

Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that is made up of cartilage. It is a rare tumor, but it is the most common type of sarcoma that occurs in the larynx. Chondrosarcomas are usually slow-growing, but they can be aggressive and spread to other parts of the body. In this case, the patient's lesion was small and did not have any features of malignancy, so a chondrosarcoma is a very unlikely diagnosis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is chondroid metaplasia. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings.

Focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis) is a benign lesion that is characterized by a small, brown macule. It is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment.

Blue nevus is a benign lesion that is characterized by a blue or black papule. It is usually found on the skin, but can also occur in the oral mucosa. It is caused by a proliferation of melanocytes in the dermis.

Malignant melanoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from melanocytes. It is the most serious type of skin cancer. It can also occur in the oral mucosa, but it is much less common than in the skin.

The patient in the case presented with a brown pigmented patch on the hard palate. The lesion was of unknown duration and was reported by the patient to be asymptomatic, although he did endorse occasional pruritus. An extraoral examination was performed without any abnormal findings. On intraoral soft tissue examination, a brown pigmented patch located predominantly on the hard palate was observed. The lesion had well-defined but irregular borders, measured 2 × 1.2 cm in size, and was nontender to palpation. Findings of the remainder of the intraoral soft tissue examination were within normal limits. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the specimen was sent for microscopic diagnosis.

Histologic examination findings revealed soft tissue covered by benign-appearing stratified squamous epithelium, focally spongiotic and acanthotic. Within the epithelium, numerous benign dendritic melanocytes were identified. The underlying connective tissues were unremarkable.

The clinical and histologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of oral melanoacanthosis. Oral melanoacanthosis is a benign lesion that is characterized by a brown or black pigmented macule or papule. It is usually found on the hard palate, but can also occur on the buccal mucosa, gingiva, and tongue. It is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. The cause of oral melanoacanthosis is unknown, but it may be related to hormonal changes, trauma, or medications. Oral melanoacanthosis is usually asymptomatic, but it can sometimes cause mild discomfort or itching. The diagnosis of oral melanoacanthosis is made based on the clinical and histologic findings. Treatment is usually not necessary, but oral melanoacanthosis can be removed surgically if it is causing symptoms or if it is cosmetically unacceptable.

Focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis) is a benign lesion that is characterized by a small, brown macule. It is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. The clinical and histologic findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of focal melanotic macule.

Blue nevus is a benign lesion that is characterized by a blue or black papule. It is usually found on the skin, but can also occur in the oral mucosa. It is caused by a proliferation of melanocytes in the dermis. The clinical and histologic findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of blue nevus.

Malignant melanoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from melanocytes. It is the most serious type of skin cancer. It can also occur in the oral mucosa, but it is much less common than in the skin. The clinical and histologic findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Oral melanoacanthosis (melanoacanthoma).

 24%|██▎       | 359/1525 [1:28:43<5:13:51, 16.15s/it]The correct answer is A. Schwannoma.

A schwannoma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that surround nerve fibers. Schwannomas are the most common type of peripheral nerve tumor. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head and neck region.

The symptoms of a schwannoma vary depending on the location of the tumor. In the case of a schwannoma of the trigeminal nerve, the patient may experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the face. The tumor may also cause facial swelling or fullness.

The diagnosis of a schwannoma is made with a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting schwannomas.

The treatment of a schwannoma is surgical removal. This can be performed with a minimally invasive approach, such as endoscopic surgery or nerve-sparing surgery.

The prognosis for patients with schwannomas is excellent. With surgical removal, the vast majority of patients are cured.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Juvenile angiofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from the blood vessels of the nasopharynx. It is most common in adolescent boys. The symptoms of juvenile angiofibroma include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is surgical removal. The prognosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment.
* Odontogenic keratocyst is a benign tumor that arises from the lining of the tooth socket. It is most common in young adults. The symptoms of odontogenic keratocyst include swelling, pain, and infection in the jaw. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is surgical removal. The prognosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment.
* Chondrosarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that arises from cartilage. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the bones of the arms and legs. The symptoms of chondrosarcoma vary depending on the location of the tumor. In the case of a chondrosarcoma of the jaw, the patient may experience pain, swelling, and numbness in the face. The tumor may also cause facial deformity. The diagnosis of chondrosarcoma is made with a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. CT or MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting chondrosarcoma. Treatment is surgical removal. The prognosis for patients with chondrosarcoma depends on the stage of the tumor at diagnosis. With early diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis is good. However, with advanced disease, the prognosis is poor.

The patient is a young adult nonsmoker with a history of asthma who presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months. The mass was soft and nontender, and there was no fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver. Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic carotid body tumors. Carotid body tumors are rare, neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the carotid body, a small structure located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. They are usually benign, but can rarely metastasize. Metastatic carotid body tumors typically present with a mass in the neck, which may be accompanied by symptoms such as headache, facial pain, or Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis). Imaging studies such as CT or MRI can show a mass in the carotid space, and PET/MRI can be used to detect metastases. The treatment of metastatic carotid body tumors is typically surgery followed by radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic glomus vagale tumors are rare, neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the glomus vagale, a small structure located in the jugular foramen. They are usually benign, but can rarely metastasize. Metastatic glomus vagale tumors typically present with a mass in the neck, which may be accompanied by symptoms such as facial pain, otalgia, or hearing loss. Imaging studies such as CT or MRI can show a mass in the jugular foramen, and PET/MRI can be used to detect metastases. The treatment of metastatic glomus vagale tumors is typically surgery followed by radiation therapy.
* Metastatic sarcoma is a cancer that arises from connective tissue. It can metastasize to any part of the body, including the neck. Metastatic sarcoma typically presents with a mass in the neck, which may be accompanied by symptoms such as pain, fever, and weight loss. Imaging studies such as CT or MRI can show a mass in the neck, and PET/MRI can be used to detect metastases. The treatment of metastatic sarcoma is typically surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
* Lymphoma is a cancer that arises from the lymphatic system. It can metastasize to any part of the body, including the neck. Lymphoma typically presents with a mass in the neck, which may be accompanied by symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Imaging studies such as CT or MRI can show a mass in the neck, and PET/MRI can be used to detect metastases. The treatment of lymphoma is typically chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

 24%|██▎       | 361/1525 [1:29:17<5:20:30, 16.52s/it]The correct answer is C. Order optical coherence tomography.

Indocyanine green angiography is a type of imaging test that uses a dye to visualize blood vessels in the eye. It is not typically used to diagnose central scotoma, which is a loss of vision in the center of the visual field.

Discontinuation of immunosuppression therapy is not warranted in this case. The patient's Crohn disease is controlled with monthly injections of ustekinumab, and there is no evidence that his vision loss is related to his immunosuppression therapy.

Repeat neuroimaging is not necessary at this time. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit and brain with and without contrast was unremarkable.

Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive imaging test that uses light to create cross-sectional images of the eye. It is a very sensitive test that can be used to diagnose a variety of eye diseases, including central scotoma. In this case, optical coherence tomography would be helpful to determine the cause of the patient's vision loss and to monitor his response to treatment.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

The patient has bilateral severe optic nerve edema, which is a sign of increased intracranial pressure. The patient also has empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, which are all signs of increased ICP.

Obtaining venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain will help to determine the cause of the increased ICP. Venography can show if there is a blockage in the venous system, which could be causing the increased ICP.

A is incorrect because enhanced depth imaging–optical coherence tomography is not a good test for diagnosing increased ICP.

B is incorrect because lumbar puncture with opening pressure is a risky procedure that should only be performed if there is a strong suspicion of meningitis. In this case, the patient does not have any symptoms of meningitis, so there is no need to perform a lumbar puncture.

D is incorrect because acetazolamide is a medication that is used to treat glaucoma, not increased ICP.

 24%|██▍       | 363/1525 [1:29:39<4:22:09, 13.54s/it]The correct answer is B. Assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. The patient's history of heavy tobacco and alcohol consumption puts him at risk for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. These deficiencies can cause optic neuropathy, which is a condition that damages the optic nerve and can lead to vision loss. Symptoms of optic neuropathy include blurred vision, loss of color vision, and central scotomas (blind spots).

Liver function tests are not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest liver disease. Treatment with disulfiram is not indicated because the patient does not have alcohol dependence. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a neurological disorder.

The patient should be evaluated for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. If these deficiencies are present, they can be treated with vitamin supplements. The patient should also be advised to quit smoking and to reduce his alcohol intake.

The patient has developed corneal edema after starting netarsudil, which is a known side effect of this medication. The edema is worsening, and the patient is experiencing pain and irritation. Stopping netarsudil is the most likely way to resolve the corneal edema and relieve the patient's symptoms.

Choice A, stop timolol in the right eye, is incorrect. Timolol is a beta-blocker, which is a class of medication that is used to lower intraocular pressure. It is not known to cause corneal edema.

Choice B, stop latanoprost in both eyes, is incorrect. Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue, which is a class of medication that is also used to lower intraocular pressure. It is not known to cause corneal edema.

Choice D, resume dorzolamide in the right eye, is incorrect. Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is a class of medication that is also used to lower intraocular pressure. It is not known to cause corneal edema.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Stop netarsudil in both eyes. The patient has developed corneal edema after starting netarsudil, which is a known side effect of this medication.

The patient's presentation is consistent with systemic sclerosis, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Raynaud's phenomenon, the episodic vasoconstriction of the small blood vessels in the extremities, is a common early feature of systemic sclerosis. The patient's history of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips of both hands is consistent with digital ulcers, a serious complication of Raynaud's phenomenon.

Vasodilator therapy is the mainstay of treatment for digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is effective in dilating the blood vessels and improving blood flow to the extremities. In addition to vasodilator therapy, other measures that may be helpful in the treatment of digital ulcers include keeping the extremities warm, avoiding smoking, and maintaining good skin care.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Give intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone. Systemic corticosteroids are not routinely used in the treatment of digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis. However, they may be used in patients with severe digital ulcers that are not responding to other treatment measures.
* B: Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. Anticoagulation is not routinely used in the treatment of digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis. However, it may be used in patients with digital ulcers that are at high risk for thrombosis, such as those with a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
* C: Start empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics are not routinely used in the treatment of digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis. However, they may be used in patients with digital ulcers that are infected.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D: Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine.

Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is a rare variant of sarcoidosis that presents with erythematous, scaly plaques. The plaques are typically found on the lower extremities, but can also occur on the arms, trunk, and face. The lesions are often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows granulomatous inflammation in the dermis.

There is no cure for plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis, but the condition can be managed with treatment. Treatment typically includes corticosteroids and other medications to suppress the immune system.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disease that affects the blood vessels and lymphatic system. It can cause skin lesions, but these are typically not scaly or ichthyosiform.
* Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can cause granulomas in the dermis. However, it does not typically cause scaly or ichthyosiform lesions.
* Cutaneous tuberculosis is a skin infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can cause skin lesions that are scaly or ichthyosiform, but these are typically associated with other symptoms, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.

Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin. It is characterized by a scaly, red rash that can appear on any part of the body, but is most commonly found on the face, scalp, and hands. The rash is often accompanied by pain, itching, and sensitivity to sunlight.

Facial papules in frontal fibrosing alopecia is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss on the front of the scalp. It is characterized by the development of small, red bumps on the forehead and temples. These bumps can eventually turn into scaly plaques that cause the hair to fall out.

Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate is a rare skin condition that causes small, red bumps on the face and neck. The bumps are often accompanied by itching and burning. Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate is usually self-limiting and goes away on its own within a few months.

Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is a rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It is characterized by a single, solitary lesion on the skin. The lesion is often a scaly, red plaque that can be itchy or painful. Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is usually slow-growing and can be treated with topical therapy.

The patient in the case presented with a 1-year history of a pruritic, dark red plaque on his right upper eyelid. The plaque is consistent with the clinical presentation of unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides. The histopathologic findings of perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates around cystically dilated follicular infundibula and exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium are also consistent with this diagnosis. The immunohistochemical findings of lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56 further support the diagnosis of unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides. The monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin. It is characterized by a scaly, red rash that can appear on any part of the body, but is most commonly found on the face, scalp, and hands.

PML is a rare, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). It is most commonly seen in patients with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with AIDS or those who have undergone organ transplantation.

The clinical presentation of PML varies depending on the location of the lesions in the CNS. Common symptoms include visual disturbances, cognitive impairment, weakness, and seizures. The diagnosis of PML is made with MRI imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.

There is no cure for PML, but treatment with antiviral agents, such as cidofovir, can help to slow the progression of the disease. The prognosis for PML is poor, with a median survival of 6-12 months.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Metastatic breast cancer is unlikely in this case, given the patient's history of follicular lymphoma and the absence of other evidence of metastatic disease.

 24%|██▍       | 369/1525 [1:31:03<4:20:07, 13.50s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain chest radiographs.

The patient has a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted, with active fixation leads placed in the right atrium and right ventricular apex. An ECG obtained immediately after the procedure showed an atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. The postimplantation course was uncomplicated, and he was subsequently discharged. He presented for routine postprocedure outpatient follow-up, at which time this ECG (Figure 1) was obtained. His vital signs were documented as a blood pressure of 119/69 mm Hg, a heart rate of 51 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. He was asymptomatic.

The ECG shows a regular rhythm at a rate of 51 beats per minute. There is a P wave before each QRS complex, which indicates that the pacemaker is pacing the atrium. The QRS complex is wide and bizarre, which suggests that the pacemaker is not pacing the ventricle. The PR interval is normal, which indicates that the pacemaker is properly sensing the atrial depolarization.

The most likely explanation for this ECG is that the pacemaker lead in the right ventricular apex has dislodged. This can happen for a number of reasons, including infection, trauma, or simply the natural movement of the heart. When the pacemaker lead dislodges, it can no longer pace the ventricle. This can cause a number of problems, including syncope, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.

The next step in management is to obtain chest radiographs to confirm the diagnosis of lead dislodgement. If the lead is dislodged, the patient will need to be admitted to the hospital for further management. This may include repositioning the lead, replacing the lead, or implanting a new pacemaker.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Placing a transvenous pacing device is not necessary in this case because the patient is already in atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm.
* Beginning transcutaneous pacing is not necessary in this case because the patient is already in atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm.
* Placing a magnet on the pulse generator will not help in this case because the patient is already in atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm.

It is a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV disease. KS can present with a variety of clinical manifestations, including skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. The diagnosis of KS is confirmed by biopsy. The treatment of KS depends on the stage of disease and the patient's overall health status. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Syphilitic gumma of the larynx is a rare complication of syphilis. It is characterized by a gummatous lesion that can involve the larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. The treatment of syphilitic gumma of the larynx is with penicillin.
* Bacillary angiomatosis is a vascular proliferation that is caused by infection with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. It is a common infection in patients with HIV/AIDS. Bacillary angiomatosis can present with a variety of clinical manifestations, including skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. The diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis is confirmed by biopsy. The treatment of bacillary angiomatosis is with antibiotics.
* Angiosarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of blood vessels. It can occur at any age, but is most common in the elderly. Angiosarcoma can present with a variety of clinical manifestations, including skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma is confirmed by biopsy.

 24%|██▍       | 371/1525 [1:31:32<4:31:43, 14.13s/it]The correct diagnosis is secretory carcinoma. This is a rare type of salivary gland carcinoma that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the parotid gland. The tumor is composed of cells that produce a bubbly secretion, which is evident on histopathology and immunohistochemical staining. Secretory carcinoma is typically low-grade and has a good prognosis with early detection and treatment.

Acinic cell carcinoma is another type of salivary gland carcinoma that can present as a slow-growing, painless mass. However, acinic cell carcinoma is typically more aggressive than secretory carcinoma and has a worse prognosis. On histopathology, acinic cell carcinoma is composed of cells that resemble acinar cells, which are the cells that produce saliva in normal salivary glands.

Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified is a diagnosis that is used for salivary gland carcinomas that do not fit into any of the other specific categories. This is a heterogeneous group of tumors with a wide range of prognoses.

Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is composed of a mixture of mucous cells, epidermoid cells, and glandular cells. It is typically a low-grade tumor with a good prognosis.

In the case presented, the patient had a slow-growing, painless mass in the parotid gland that was found to be positive for periodic acid–Schiff on histopathology. This finding is characteristic of secretory carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor was positive for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). These are all markers that are typically expressed in secretory carcinoma. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is secretory carcinoma.

The patient in this case has a history of blurred vision in his left eye for 4 months. On examination, his visual acuity is 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressures are normal in each eye. Anterior segment and fundus examination results are normal in the right eye. In the left eye, the media were clear, and there were multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of the normal choroidal vasculature throughout the entire fundus. There was no sign of vitritis or retinitis and no history of previous trauma, uveitis, sarcoidosis, or cancer. Ocular ultrasonography revealed diffuse ciliochoroidal thickening measuring 2.9 mm in elevation. Optical coherence tomography disclosed generalized, undulating choroidal infiltration in a seasick pattern, so to speak, given its resemblance to a stormy ocean surface, with overlying draping of the retina in the foveal region. A relook at the anterior segment in the left eye revealed a faint conjunctival thickening at the limbus suggestive of lymphoid tumor. Incisional biopsy of the epibulbar lesion revealed sheetlike infiltration of small monomorphic lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and Dutcher bodies.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. Lymphoma is a cancer of lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that fight infection. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a cancer of B lymphocytes, which are a type of lymphocyte.

The next step in the management of this patient is to complete serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy. These tests will help to determine the specific type of cancer that the patient has. Once the type of cancer is known, the patient can be treated with appropriate therapy.

Oral corticosteroids plus intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (Avastin) are not appropriate treatments for this patient. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation, but they are not effective against cancer. Avastin is a medication that is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, but it is not effective against cancer.

Topical interferon 4 times a day for 3 months is not an appropriate treatment for this patient. Interferon is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including cancer, but it is not effective against the type of cancer that this patient has.

Systemic intravenous rituximab is not an appropriate treatment for this patient. Rituximab is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including cancer, but it is not effective against the type of cancer that this patient has.

 24%|██▍       | 373/1525 [1:32:07<5:02:10, 15.74s/it]The correct answer is C. Excisional biopsy. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO is a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection that occurs in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The most common clinical manifestation of HZO is a unilateral vesicular eruption involving the skin of the face and the upper eyelid. Other possible manifestations include conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and retinal vasculitis.

The treatment of HZO is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. In most cases, these medications will help to reduce the severity of the symptoms and prevent complications. However, in some cases, HZO can lead to serious complications, such as secondary bacterial infection, keratitis, uveitis, and retinal vasculitis.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the initial treatment with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ophthalmic tobramycin was not effective. This suggests that the patient's lesion is not due to a bacterial infection, but rather to HZO. Therefore, the next step in management should be to perform an excisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of HZO and will also help to rule out other possible causes of the lesion, such as malignancy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Continued antibiotic therapy is not indicated in this case because the lesion is not due to a bacterial infection.
* Wound debridement is not indicated in this case because the lesion is not infected.
* Computed tomography scan of the orbits is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of orbital involvement.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Excisional biopsy. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with HZO, and an excisional biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of the lesion.

The patient in this case has a rapidly progressing retinal vaso-occlusive disease. The most likely cause of this condition is varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body for the rest of their life. It can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.

Shingles is a painful skin rash that can occur anywhere on the body. In some cases, it can also affect the eyes. When shingles affects the eyes, it is called herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO can cause a number of eye problems, including retinal vasculitis, optic neuritis, and retinal detachment.

The treatment for HZO is high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 3 times daily). Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that helps to suppress the VZV virus. It is important to start treatment with valacyclovir as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. This will help to reduce the severity of the eye problems and prevent permanent vision loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids are not effective in treating HZO. Intraocular corticosteroid injections can be used to treat retinal vasculitis, but they are not effective in treating optic neuritis or retinal detachment.

 25%|██▍       | 375/1525 [1:32:34<4:39:33, 14.59s/it]The correct answer is A. Obtain a full-field electroretinogram.

A full-field electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical response of the retina to light. It is a non-invasive test that can be used to diagnose a variety of retinal conditions, including retinitis pigmentosa.

The ERG is performed by placing electrodes on the surface of the eye. The electrodes measure the electrical activity of the retina in response to a series of light flashes. The results of the ERG can be used to assess the function of the retina and to diagnose various retinal disorders.

In the case of the patient in the question, the ERG would be helpful in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa. Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic disorder that causes progressive loss of vision. The ERG can be used to detect early signs of retinitis pigmentosa and to monitor the progression of the disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not be helpful in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa.

B. Conduct serology testing to measure vitamins A, B1, B12, and folate. This test would be helpful in diagnosing vitamin deficiencies, but it would not be helpful in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa.

C. Perform magnetic resonance image scan of the brain. This test would be helpful in diagnosing brain tumors or other brain disorders, but it would not be helpful in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa.

D. Perform fluorescein angiography. This test is used to visualize blood vessels in the retina. It would not be helpful in diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa, which is a disorder of the photoreceptor cells in the retina.

The patient has multiple brown masses at the pupillary margin in both eyes, encroaching on the central visual axis. This is consistent with iris cysts. Iris cysts are usually benign, but they can be associated with systemic diseases, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare, genetic disorder that can cause tumors to grow in the brain, eyes, kidneys, pancreas, and other organs. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease are at increased risk of developing cancer. Therefore, it is important to rule out von Hippel-Lindau disease in patients with iris cysts. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is the best test to rule out von Hippel-Lindau disease. It is a non-invasive test that can detect tumors in the brain, eyes, kidneys, pancreas, and other organs. Surgical iridectomy, kidney ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography scan are not necessary in this case. Surgical iridectomy is a procedure to remove a portion of the iris. It is not necessary to treat iris cysts. Kidney ultrasonography is a test to examine the kidneys. It is not necessary to rule out von Hippel-Lindau disease. Positron emission tomography scan is a test to detect cancer. It is not necessary to rule out von Hippel-Lindau disease.

The patient has a large right upper lobe cavitary mass that is enlarging and invading the pleura. She has also developed a tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition. The patient's condition is deteriorating and she is at risk of death.

The goal of treatment is to remove the infected lung tissue and prevent the spread of infection. The patient is already receiving antimicrobial therapy, but this is not sufficient to control the infection. Surgery is the only way to remove the infected tissue and prevent the spread of infection.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Changing antimicrobial therapy to meropenem and vancomycin would not be effective because the patient is already receiving these antibiotics. Changing voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B would not be effective because the patient does not have a fungal infection. Consulting radiation oncology would not be effective because the patient has a rapidly enlarging mass that requires surgical removal.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform right upper lobe resection.

Actinic prurigo cheilitis is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory condition of the lower lip that is associated with sun exposure. It is characterized by erythematous papules, some of them crusted, and some excoriations located over the lower lip. The surrounding skin, as well as inner mouth and upper lip, are spared.

Herpes simplex virus–associated pseudolymphoma is a rare condition that is characterized by a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory skin lesion that is clinically and histologically indistinguishable from lymphoma. However, it is not associated with sun exposure.

Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia is a benign condition that is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes in the skin. It is usually seen in elderly patients and is not associated with sun exposure.

Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. It is not associated with sun exposure.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Actinic prurigo cheilitis because it is the only diagnosis that is consistent with the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings.

 25%|██▍       | 379/1525 [1:33:26<4:28:31, 14.06s/it]The correct answer is D. Apical left ventricular thrombus.

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She has been receiving anticoagulation for an infusion port thrombosis. On imaging, she has several hypodense lesions in the apex of her heart. These findings are most consistent with an apical left ventricular thrombus.

Cardiac metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma are unlikely in this patient because she has not had any treatment for her pancreatic cancer. In addition, cardiac metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically occur in the right atrium or ventricle, not the left ventricle.

Myxoma is a rare tumor that can occur in the heart. It is typically a single, pedunculated mass that arises from the endocardium. Myxomas can cause embolic events, but they do not typically cause multiple masses.

Angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that can occur in the heart. It is typically a single, large mass that arises from the endothelium. Angiosarcomas can cause embolic events, but they do not typically cause multiple masses.

Apical left ventricular thrombus is a blood clot that forms in the apex of the left ventricle. It is a common complication of atrial fibrillation, but it can also occur in patients with other conditions that increase the risk of blood clots, such as heart failure, infective endocarditis, and myocardial infarction. Apical left ventricular thrombi can embolize to the brain, causing stroke.

In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is an apical left ventricular thrombus. This is supported by her history of breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, her current anticoagulation therapy, and the imaging findings of multiple hypodense lesions in the apex of her heart.

 25%|██▍       | 380/1525 [1:33:43<4:42:58, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is C: Coronary artery reimplantation.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a balloon catheter to open up a narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is a surgical procedure that bypasses a narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Coronary artery reimplantation is a surgical procedure that involves removing a segment of a diseased coronary artery and reattaching it to a healthy blood vessel.

In this case, the patient has a dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged and weak. This can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The patient also has angina and dyspnea with exertion, which are symptoms of coronary artery disease.

The goal of treatment for this patient is to improve his quality of life and reduce his risk of death. PCI and CABG are both effective treatments for coronary artery disease, but they are not appropriate for everyone. PCI is not a good option for patients with diffuse coronary artery disease, as it is difficult to open up multiple narrowed or blocked arteries with a balloon catheter. CABG is not a good option for patients who are at high risk for surgery, as it is a major surgery with a significant risk of complications.

Coronary artery reimplantation is a newer procedure that is not as well-known as PCI or CABG. However, it is a very effective treatment for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease. In this procedure, the surgeon removes a segment of a diseased coronary artery and reattaches it to a healthy blood vessel. This allows blood to flow around the diseased area and improve the function of the heart muscle.

In the case of this patient, coronary artery reimplantation is the best option because it is the most likely to improve his quality of life and reduce his risk of death. PCI and CABG are not as effective for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and they are both associated with a higher risk of complications. Coronary artery reimplantation is a newer procedure, but it is a very effective treatment for patients with this condition.

Continue medical management is not an appropriate option for this patient because it will not improve his quality of life or reduce his risk of death. Medical management can help to control the symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy, but it will not treat the underlying cause of the condition.

 25%|██▍       | 381/1525 [1:33:57<4:35:40, 14.46s/it]The correct answer is C. Order cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel.

The patient in the case presented with a number of symptoms that are consistent with prion disease, including progressive vision loss, gait changes, memory loss, and weight loss. On ophthalmic examination, he was found to have a dense right homonymous hemianopia, which is a characteristic finding in prion disease. Additional findings on neurologic examination, including decreased vibration sense and proprioception in the feet, positive Romberg sign, and inability to tandem walk, are also consistent with prion disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain and orbits with and without contrast and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) head and neck were unremarkable, which makes other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as stroke, tumor, or infection, less likely. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no localizing signs. Syphilis screen was negative. Serum thiamine, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, infectious studies, cytology, flow cytometry, and paraneoplastic panel showed only mildly elevated protein.

Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and negative workup, the next step in management is to order a CSF prion disease panel. This test is highly sensitive and specific for prion disease, and it can help to confirm the diagnosis. If the test is positive, the patient will need to be referred to a specialized center for further management.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not appropriate for the patient's presentation. A pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat retinal detachment. It is not indicated in the patient's case, as he does not have a retinal detachment. Prescribing aspirin for secondary stroke prevention is also not indicated, as the patient has no history of stroke. Referring to psychiatry for functional vision loss is also not appropriate, as the patient's vision loss is not functional.

 25%|██▌       | 382/1525 [1:34:12<4:39:44, 14.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Order systemic laboratory workup.

Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, depending on which organs are affected. In the case of the patient in the question, the amyloid deposits are located in the upper eyelid. This can cause blepharoptosis, or drooping of the eyelid.

There are several different types of amyloidosis, and the treatment depends on the type. In general, however, treatment for amyloidosis involves treating the underlying cause of the condition, if possible. In some cases, medications or surgery may be necessary to remove the amyloid deposits.

In the case of the patient in the question, the next step is to order systemic laboratory workup. This will help to determine the type of amyloidosis and the underlying cause. Once the cause is known, treatment can be started.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform a complete excision: This would be the appropriate treatment for a benign tumor, but the patient in the question has amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a systemic disease, and removing the amyloid deposits from the eyelid would not treat the underlying cause of the condition.
* B. Administer cryotherapy treatment: Cryotherapy is a treatment that uses extreme cold to destroy tissue. It is sometimes used to treat skin cancer, but it is not an appropriate treatment for amyloidosis.
* D. Observe: This would not be an appropriate treatment for amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a progressive disease, and if it is not treated, it can lead to serious complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Order systemic laboratory workup.

 25%|██▌       | 383/1525 [1:34:26<4:37:23, 14.57s/it]The correct answer is A. Initiate immunosuppressive therapy.

The patient in this case has central serous retinopathy (CSR), a condition that causes fluid to leak from the blood vessels in the retina. This can lead to blurred vision, floaters, and a dark spot in the center of vision. CSR is usually a self-limiting condition, meaning that it will go away on its own within a few months. However, in some cases, the fluid leakage can be severe enough to cause permanent vision loss.

The patient in this case has had CSR for one week, and her vision has already worsened significantly. In addition, she has developed extensive exudative retinal detachments, which are areas of the retina that have become detached from the underlying tissue. Exudative retinal detachments can lead to permanent vision loss if they are not treated.

The most common treatment for CSR is to use topical corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation and leakage of fluid from the blood vessels. However, in cases where the CSR is severe or does not respond to topical corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary. Immunosuppressive therapy works by suppressing the immune system, which can help to reduce the inflammation and leakage of fluid from the blood vessels.

In the case of this patient, it is clear that she needs more aggressive treatment than topical corticosteroids alone. Her vision has already worsened significantly, and she has developed extensive exudative retinal detachments. Immunosuppressive therapy is the best option for this patient because it has the potential to stop the progression of her CSR and prevent permanent vision loss.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option B, monitoring for resolution of subretinal fluid, is not a viable option because the patient's vision has already worsened significantly. Option C, retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle, is a surgical option that is typically reserved for cases of CSR that have not responded to other treatments. Option D, surgery to create scleral windows, is a surgical option that is used to treat a different condition, called retinal vein occlusion.

The lymphocytes are positive for CD3, CD5, and CD8, and negative for CD4.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a non-neoplastic disorder of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. It can present with a variety of skin lesions, including solitary or multiple papules, nodules, and plaques. The histopathology of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is characterized by infiltration of the epidermis and dermis by Langerhans cells, which are positive for CD1a and S100.

Lymphomatoid contact dermatitis is a rare, inflammatory skin disorder that is often misdiagnosed as eczema or psoriasis. It is characterized by a chronic, lichenoid eruption that is often associated with a history of contact with a variety of allergens. The histopathology of lymphomatoid contact dermatitis is characterized by a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with a predominance of CD4+ T cells.

Mycosis fungoides is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents as a patchy or plaque-like eruption on the skin. The histopathology of mycosis fungoides is characterized by a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis, with occasional Pautrier microabscesses. The lymphocytes are positive for CD3, CD4, and CD5.

In the case presented, the patient is a preschool-age girl with a solitary, scaly plaque on the lower extremity that has been present for 1 year.

It is most common in people with HIV/AIDS, but it can also occur in people who have had organ transplants or who have certain types of cancer. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as a red or purple skin lesion, which can be flat or raised. The lesion may grow and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone marrow.

B. Elder abuse is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for older adults. It can take many forms, including physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, and neglect. Elder abuse is often underreported, and it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms so that you can help protect older adults who may be at risk.

C. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is most common in people over the age of 60, and it is more common in women than men. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma typically presents as a red or purple skin lesion, which can be flat or raised. The lesion may grow and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone marrow.

Telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma typically presents as a red or purple skin lesion, which can be flat or raised. The lesion may grow and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone marrow.

The patient in the case presented with a 4-month history of new-onset persistent facial eruption. He denied a history of facial flushing. The patient was initially treated for rosacea at an outside hospital with topical 1% metronidazole cream for 1 month without improvement and developed acute facial purpura after 1 day of treatment with oral doxycycline, which was discontinued. Because of the eruption’s rapid onset and violaceous appearance, as well as empirical treatment failure, the patient was referred for further evaluation. On examination, the patient had asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques over a phymatous background. A series of punch biopsies were performed. The histopathologic image showed ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis. On higher magnification, ectatic vascular channels were lined by atypical plump endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry was negative for Human herpesvirus 8.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of rosacea-like angiosarcoma. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is most common in people over the age of 60, and it is more common in women than men. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma typically presents as a red or purple skin lesion, which can be flat or raised.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, myoclonus, and seizures. However, PMEs typically begin in childhood or adolescence, whereas the patient in the case report is an adult. Additionally, PMEs are typically associated with other neurological abnormalities, such as ataxia, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms, which are not present in the patient in the case report.

Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the skin that is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, chills, and a painful, erythematous rash that has well-defined borders. The rash is typically in the shape of a glove or stocking and can spread to other parts of the body. Erysipelas is most common in older adults, people with diabetes, and people with weakened immune systems.

Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that affects the blood vessels. It is characterized by the presence of large, atypical B-cells in the blood vessels. Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is most common in older adults, and it is often fatal.

Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that affects the small blood vessels in the skin. It is characterized by the presence of inflammation and necrosis of the blood vessels. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis can be caused by a number of factors, including infection, drugs, and autoimmune diseases.

The patient in the case presentation has a number of features that are consistent with intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. The patient is a middle-aged woman, which is the age group that is most commonly affected by this type of lymphoma. The patient has a history of multiple painful erythematous plaques on her lower legs, which is the typical presentation of intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. The patient also has an elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, which is a marker of inflammation that is often seen in patients with intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. The patient's skin biopsy specimen revealed dilated vessels filled with atypical large lymphoid cells throughout the dermis, which is a characteristic finding of intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a type of ultrasound that uses a probe that is inserted into the esophagus to provide images of the heart and blood vessels. TEE is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in the evaluation of aortic regurgitation (AR). In this case, the patient has a history of worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema after giving birth. She also has a new heart murmur and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level. These findings are consistent with AR. A TTE showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe AR, and a mildly dilated aortic root. However, the TTE was not diagnostic because of motion artifacts. A TEE would be more likely to provide diagnostic images of the aortic root and AR.

A blood culture is not necessary in this case because the patient is not febrile and her white blood cell count is within normal limits. A cardiac catheterization is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with coronary artery disease. A repeat non-ECG-gated computed tomography angiography is not necessary in this case because the previous study was not diagnostic.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform transesophageal echocardiography.

Amiodarone is a medication that is used to treat arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats. It can cause a number of side effects, including corneal verticillata, which is a condition that causes the cornea to become cloudy. Corneal verticillata is usually harmless and does not require treatment. However, if it is severe, it can cause vision problems.

In this case, the patient has a history of taking amiodarone. He stopped taking the medication 10 months ago, but he still has corneal verticillata. This suggests that the corneal verticillata may be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders are caused by the body's immune system attacking its own tissues. In the case of corneal verticillata, the immune system may be attacking the cornea.

To determine if the patient has an autoimmune disorder, the doctor should order laboratory tests to measure the levels of immunoglobulins in his blood. Immunoglobulins are proteins that are produced by the immune system. If the patient's immunoglobulin levels are high, it suggests that he has an autoimmune disorder.

If the patient does have an autoimmune disorder, there are a number of treatments that can be used to control the condition. These treatments include medications, such as steroids, and light therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Provide reassurance, because the patient is no longer taking amiodarone. This is not the correct answer because the corneal verticillata may be caused by an underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder.

B. Obtain genetic testing. This is not the correct answer because there is no known genetic link to corneal verticillata.

C. Initiate corneal scraping and culture. This is not the correct answer because corneal scraping and culture are only necessary if there is a suspicion of infection. In this case, there is no evidence of infection.

The patient in this case has severe progressive bilateral vision loss with headaches. She has papilledema, which is swelling of the optic nerve head. This is a sign of increased intracranial pressure, which can be caused by a number of conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

IIH is a condition in which the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain is increased. This can cause a number of symptoms, including headache, vision problems, and nausea and vomiting. The underlying cause of IIH is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a blockage of the venous drainage system in the brain.

The treatment for IIH is to reduce the pressure of the CSF. This can be done with medications, such as acetazolamide, or with surgery. Surgery is usually only recommended for patients who do not respond to medication or who have severe vision loss.

In this case, the patient has near-complete vision loss in both eyes. This is a sign that the pressure of the CSF is very high and that the optic nerves are being damaged. The patient should have immediate surgery to reduce the pressure of the CSF. The most common type of surgery for IIH is optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF).

ONSF is a minimally invasive procedure in which a small hole is made in the optic nerve sheath. This allows the CSF to flow out of the brain and reduce the pressure. ONSF is a very effective treatment for IIH. In most cases, it will improve or resolve the vision problems caused by the condition.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the best treatment for IIH in this case.

A. Begin intravenous anticoagulation: This is a treatment for blood clots. It is not the best treatment for IIH because the patient does not have a blood clot.

B. Serial lumbar punctures: This is a procedure in which fluid is removed from the spinal canal. It is sometimes used to treat IIH, but it is not the best treatment in this case. The patient has already had a lumbar puncture, and it did not improve her vision.

D. Consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement: This is a treatment for hydrocephalus. It is not the best treatment for IIH because the patient does not have hydrocephalus.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF). This is the best treatment for the patient's severe progressive bilateral vision loss with headaches.

A positron emission tomographic scan (PET scan) is a nuclear medicine procedure that uses a special camera to create images of the body. A PET scan can be used to diagnose cancer, heart disease, and other conditions. However, a PET scan cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of a mass in the greater wing of the sphenoid.

Starting treatment with intravenous antibiotics or intravenous corticosteroids without a definitive diagnosis could potentially harm the patient. Antibiotics are used to treat infections, but they can also have side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation, but they can also have side effects, such as weight gain, moon face, and high blood pressure.

Performing a biopsy of the lesion is the best way to obtain a definitive diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the body and examined under a microscope. A biopsy can help to determine the type of mass, its stage, and its grade. This information is important for planning the best course of treatment for the patient.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Perform biopsy of lesion. The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide a definitive diagnosis of the mass in the greater wing of the sphenoid.

This is a rare, chronic, recurrent, and sometimes debilitating dermatosis characterized by verrucous, exophytic, and vegetating lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. It is caused by infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), most commonly type 2.

The patient in this case presented with a 5 × 7-cm verrucous, exophytic tumor with scant yellow drainage on the right medial buttock extending to the perianal skin. She had a history of genital herpes, and her medical history was notable for chronic kidney disease. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of herpes vegetans.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and hands. It is typically a slow-growing cancer, but it can be aggressive if it is not treated. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, and her lesion did not have any features that are suspicious for malignancy. Therefore, squamous cell carcinoma is an unlikely diagnosis.

CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that can occur in the skin. It is typically a rapidly growing tumor that can be life-threatening. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for lymphoma, and her lesion did not have any features that are suspicious for malignancy. Therefore, CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is an unlikely diagnosis.

Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor) is a rare, sexually transmitted disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). It is characterized by large, cauliflower-like lesions on the genital or perianal skin. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for HPV, and her lesion did not have any features that are suspicious for giant condyloma acuminatum. Therefore, giant condyloma acuminatum is an unlikely diagnosis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for this patient is herpes vegetans. This is a rare, chronic, recurrent, and sometimes debilitating dermatosis characterized by verrucous, exophytic, and vegetating lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. It is caused by infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), most commonly type 2.

This is because the patient presented with scaly erythematous patches and plaques covering 10% of her total body surface area without clinically appreciable lymphadenopathy. Histopathological testing demonstrated an epidermotropic infiltrate of hyperchromatic, convoluted, atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei with basilar tagging and papillary dermal fibrosis. Studies of T-cell gene rearrangements identified a clonal population. Blood-flow cytometry did not reveal aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes. She was treated initially with topical and intralesional corticosteroids and narrow band UV B phototherapy. Oral bexarotene was subsequently added for recalcitrant disease. Within 2 months, she developed isolated, painful tumors. A second biopsy was performed, which was notable for an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD3+, CD4−, and CD8− weak lymphocytes, which were positive for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor (Bf) 1 and negative for CD30 and CD56. The results of flow cytometry and imaging were unremarkable. After an initial favorable response with chlorambucil, she developed expanding ulcerated tumors complicated by a polymicrobial superinfection. Chlorambucil was discontinued in favor of antimicrobial treatment. She then received liposomal doxorubicin, although skin involvement continued to progress rapidly, with ulcerating tumors making up as much as 80% of her total body surface area. She was hospitalized for worsening disease and pain. Repeated histopathologic analysis was done.

A. CD8+ mycosis fungoides is an indolent T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches, plaques, and tumors on the skin. It is characterized by an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD8+ lymphocytes. However, the patient in this case presented with rapidly evolving necrotic plaques and nodules, which is not typical of CD8+ mycosis fungoides. Additionally, the histopathological findings in this case were not consistent with CD8+ mycosis fungoides.

B. Lymphomatoid papulosis, type D is a rare variant of lymphomatoid papulosis that is characterized by the presence of large, atypical lymphocytes in the skin. It is often associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). However, the patient in this case did not have HHV-8 infection, and her clinical presentation was not typical of lymphomatoid papulosis, type D.

C. Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with rapidly evolving necrotic plaques and nodules on the skin. It is characterized by an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD8+ lymphocytes that are positive for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor (Bf) 1. The histopathological findings in this case were consistent with primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, the patient's clinical presentation was consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a rare T-cell lymphoma that can occur in both the skin and the blood. It is characterized by an infiltrate of natural killer (NK) cells or T cells that are positive for CD56. However, the patient in this case did not have an infiltrate of NK cells or T cells that were positive for CD56. Additionally, her clinical presentation was not typical of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. The most common presentation of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a solitary or multiple skin lesions. The lesions can be red, purple, or brown, and they may be raised or flat. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma can be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both.

Metastatic carcinoma is a type of cancer that has spread from its original site to other parts of the body. The most common type of metastatic carcinoma to the skin is breast cancer. Other types of cancer that can metastasize to the skin include lung cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. The symptoms of metastatic carcinoma to the skin vary depending on the type of cancer and the location of the metastasis. Common symptoms include a lump or mass on the skin, a change in the color of the skin, and bleeding or discharge from the skin. Metastatic carcinoma to the skin is treated with the same types of treatment that are used for the original cancer.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that is often aggressive and can be fatal. It is characterized by the proliferation of Merkel cells, a type of cell that is found in the skin. The most common presentation of Merkel cell carcinoma is a small, red, raised bump on the skin. The bump may be painless or it may be itchy or painful. Merkel cell carcinoma can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The patient in the case presented with a 6-week history of an enlarging, tender, pruritic, 4-cm erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules distributed on the medial forehead. No inciting events, such as arthropod bite or trauma, were noted. She was initially treated for presumed shingles with valacyclovir, cephalexin, gabapentin, and hydrocortisone 2.5% topical ointment with no improvement in appearance or symptoms. No other cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A punch biopsy specimen of the left medial forehead was obtained, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Histopathological results revealed dissecting vascular channels (black arrowheads) and spindle cells (white arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin). Immunohistochemical staining revealed CD31 and diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components.

The findings of the biopsy are consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from blood vessels. It can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the skin. Angiosarcoma is often aggressive and can be fatal. The treatment for angiosarcoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

 26%|██▌       | 396/1525 [1:37:40<4:45:28, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is C. Consult cardiothoracic surgery for controlled operative thrombectomy.

The patient has a large mobile thrombus extending from the right atrium into the right ventricle, as well as a clot in the left atrium and left ventricle that appeared to originate from the interatrial septum, suggesting a defect there. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.

Systemic thrombolysis and catheter-directed thrombolysis are both options for treating pulmonary embolism, but they are not appropriate in this case. Systemic thrombolysis carries a risk of bleeding, and catheter-directed thrombolysis may not be effective in removing the large thrombus in the right atrium.

Controlled operative thrombectomy is the most effective way to remove the thrombus in this case. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a catheter into the right atrium and using it to remove the thrombus. This procedure has a low risk of bleeding and is very effective in removing large thrombi.

The other choices are incorrect because they are either not effective or carry a high risk of bleeding.

Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder caused by excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) from a pituitary tumor. GH is a hormone that stimulates growth in children and adolescents. In adults, GH causes enlargement of the bones and soft tissues, leading to characteristic features such as a large head, hands, and feet. Other symptoms of acromegaly include fatigue, headache, joint pain, and sweating.

Tonsillar hypertrophy is a condition in which the tonsils, two small organs located in the back of the throat, become enlarged. Tonsillar hypertrophy can be caused by a number of conditions, including infections, allergies, and sleep apnea.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's immune system. Lymphoma can cause a number of symptoms, including swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

Normal anatomic variant is a term used to describe a condition that is not caused by a disease or disorder. In the case of tonsillar hypertrophy, normal anatomic variant may be used to describe a condition in which the tonsils are enlarged but there is no underlying cause.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely diagnosis is acromegaly. The patient's history of severe obstructive sleep apnea, macroglossia, and growth in his tongue and feet are all consistent with acromegaly. The patient's tonsillar hypertrophy is likely a secondary finding due to the enlargement of his tongue and soft tissues.

Allergic rhinitis is a common condition that causes inflammation of the nasal passages. Allergic rhinitis can cause a number of symptoms, including sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and congestion. However, allergic rhinitis does not cause the characteristic features of acromegaly, such as a large head, hands, and feet.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's immune system. Lymphoma can cause a number of symptoms, including swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. However, lymphoma does not cause the characteristic features of acromegaly, such as a large head, hands, and feet.

Normal anatomic variant is a term used to describe a condition that is not caused by a disease or disorder. In the case of tonsillar hypertrophy, normal anatomic variant may be used to describe a condition in which the tonsils are enlarged but there is no underlying cause.

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare non-neoplastic disorder of the lymph nodes characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes. It is typically seen in children and young adults, and most cases are self-limited. The clinical presentation is variable, but patients may present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, and treatment is usually not necessary.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a self-limiting inflammatory disorder of the lymph nodes. It is typically seen in young adults, and most cases resolve spontaneously within a few months. The clinical presentation is variable, but patients may present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, and treatment is usually not necessary.

Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease is a rare, aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder that is characterized by the proliferation of CD4+ T cells. It is typically seen in adults, and most cases are fatal. The clinical presentation is variable, but patients may present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, and treatment is usually with chemotherapy.

Castleman disease is a rare, lymphoproliferative disorder that is characterized by the proliferation of B cells. It is typically seen in adults, and there are two main subtypes: hyaline vascular and plasma cell variants. The clinical presentation is variable, but patients may present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, and treatment is usually with surgery or chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient is a 17-year-old male with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass was initially treated with antibiotics, but it persisted. The patient then developed a sore throat and fever. Imaging studies showed an enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node. The patient underwent a left neck dissection, and the pathologic examination of the resected lymph node showed a regressed germinal center penetrated by a hyalinized vessel and small lymphocytes in mantle zone palisading around the residual germinal centers. These findings are consistent with Castleman disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or the pathologic findings.

 26%|██▌       | 399/1525 [1:38:21<4:32:23, 14.51s/it]The correct answer is D. Elect observation.

The patient is a 65-year-old white woman with stage IV breast cancer with metastases to the lungs and liver. She presented with a new onset of what she called “multiple green spots” in both eyes for 3 days. The spots were stationary; she denied any floaters or photopsias. The onset was simultaneous in both eyes, with no associated eye pain or photophobia. There was no ocular history, and a recent comprehensive eye examination had normal results. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. An anterior segment examination had unremarkable results. There was no vitritis, and her optic nerves were pink and sharp. A dilated fundus examination revealed multifocal, hypopigmented, cream-colored spots scattered throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. These spots were hyperautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence and localized to the subretinal space. Notably, 2 weeks prior to presentation, she had started taking cobimetinib therapy as part of a clinical trial for her breast cancer.

The most likely diagnosis is drug-induced maculopathy. This is a rare but well-recognized complication of several systemic medications, including cobimetinib. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to be related to damage to the retinal pigment epithelium. The clinical presentation typically consists of the acute onset of bilateral, painless, paracentral scotomas. Fundus examination may reveal multifocal, hypopigmented, cream-colored spots scattered throughout the posterior pole. These spots are hyperautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence and localized to the subretinal space.

The treatment of drug-induced maculopathy is generally supportive. In most cases, the visual symptoms will resolve spontaneously over time. However, in some cases, the visual loss may be permanent. There is no specific treatment that has been shown to be effective in preventing or treating drug-induced maculopathy.

In this case, the patient has a new onset of multiple green spots in both eyes. The spots are stationary, and she denies any floaters or photopsias. The onset was simultaneous in both eyes, with no associated eye pain or photophobia. There was no ocular history, and a recent comprehensive eye examination had normal results. Her visual acuity is 20/20 OU. An anterior segment examination had unremarkable results. There was no vitritis, and her optic nerves were pink and sharp. A dilated fundus examination revealed multifocal, hypopigmented, cream-colored spots scattered throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. These spots were hyperautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence and localized to the subretinal space. Notably, 2 weeks prior to presentation, she had started taking cobimetinib therapy as part of a clinical trial for her breast cancer.

The most likely diagnosis is drug-induced maculopathy. The correct management is to elect observation. This is because the visual symptoms of drug-induced maculopathy typically resolve spontaneously over time. In most cases, there is no need for specific treatment. However, if the visual loss is severe or progressive, then treatment may be necessary. This may include discontinuing the offending medication, or using corticosteroids or other medications to reduce inflammation.

The other options are incorrect. Option A, initiating an oral prednisone course, is not appropriate in this case. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is sometimes used to treat drug-induced maculopathy. However, it is not necessary in this case because the patient's visual symptoms are mild and they are likely to resolve spontaneously. Option B, ordering a positron emission tomography scan, is not necessary in this case. A positron emission tomography scan is a nuclear medicine imaging test that is used to detect cancer. It is not necessary in this case because the patient has already been diagnosed with breast cancer. Option C, discontinuing breast cancer treatment, is also not appropriate in this case. The patient's breast cancer is currently under control, and there is no evidence that the cobimetinib is causing her visual problems. Therefore, there is no need to discontinue her breast cancer treatment.

 26%|██▌       | 400/1525 [1:38:37<4:42:44, 15.08s/it]The correct answer is C: Inquire about bright light exposures.

The patient's history of a suspected overdose with several medications, including atomoxetine, quetiapine, melatonin, fluoxetine, bupropion, and clonazepam, is concerning for a toxic maculopathy. However, the patient's visual acuity loss was atraumatic, painless, constant, symmetric, and nonprogressive, which is not typical of a toxic maculopathy. Additionally, the patient's OCT findings are consistent with a central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), which is a non-inflammatory condition that is thought to be caused by a disruption of the blood-retinal barrier. CSC is typically seen in young, healthy individuals who have been exposed to bright light, such as from welding, snow blindness, or sun exposure.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's management should be to inquire about bright light exposures. If the patient has a history of recent bright light exposure, then CSC is a likely diagnosis. Treatment for CSC typically involves avoiding bright light and using topical steroids. In some cases, oral steroids may also be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Stop all psychiatric medications. This is not necessary, as the patient's visual acuity loss is not likely due to the medications.
* B: Obtain an electroretinogram. This test is not necessary, as the patient's OCT findings are consistent with CSC.
* D: Prescribe oral steroids. This is not necessary, as the patient's visual acuity loss is not severe and is likely to improve with conservative treatment.

The patient has acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye of 2 days’ duration associated with right periorbital pain. His medical history is remarkable for diabetes mellitus of 40 years’ duration complicated by end-stage renal disease requiring a renal transplant and ongoing immunosuppression. His visual acuity is no light perception OD and 20/40 OS. The right eye exhibits an amaurotic pupil, severe generalized restriction of extraocular movement, and ptosis with poor levator function. His intraocular pressures are normal. At a base of 104 mm, exophthalmometer measurements are 24 mm OD and 20 mm OS. The results of a slitlamp examination were noncontributory in both eyes. A dilated fundus examination revealed a pale optic disc in the right eye and panretinal laser scars in both eyes. Cranial nerves V and VII-XII were intact bilaterally. The patient was afebrile, with vital signs within normal limits. His leukocyte count was 2200 cells/μL.

Noncontrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit demonstrated highly attenuating debris and bony irregularities throughout the paranasal sinuses and fat stranding in the right orbital apex. Magnetic resonance venography of the head had unremarkable results. Results of a sinus biopsy by the otolaryngology service demonstrated fungal hyphal elements. Systemic therapy was initiated, and the otolaryngology service planned urgent surgical nasosinal debridement. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was withheld pending stabilization in the patient’s renal status.

The most likely diagnosis is fungal orbital pseudotumor, a rare but serious complication of rhinosinusitis. Fungal orbital pseudotumor is typically caused by invasive fungal infections, such as Aspergillus or Mucor species. The most common risk factors for fungal orbital pseudotumor are diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and chronic rhinosinusitis.

The initial treatment of fungal orbital pseudotumor is systemic antifungal therapy. The most common antifungal agents used for this condition are amphotericin B, voriconazole, and posaconazole. In some cases, surgical debridement of the orbit may be necessary to remove infected tissue and improve drainage.

In the case presented, the patient has a number of risk factors for fungal orbital pseudotumor, including diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and chronic rhinosinusitis. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with fungal orbital pseudotumor, with acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye, right periorbital pain, and amaurotic pupil. The imaging studies demonstrate highly attenuating debris and bony irregularities throughout the paranasal sinuses and fat stranding in the right orbital apex, which are also consistent with fungal orbital pseudotumor. The sinus biopsy results demonstrate fungal hyphal elements, which provide definitive diagnosis.

The patient's renal status is unstable, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent. This will provide high concentrations of antifungal agent to the orbit without the need for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Await improvement in renal status and perform contrast-enhanced imaging is incorrect because the patient's renal status is unstable and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency.
* Option C: Perform orbital debridement is incorrect because the patient's renal status is unstable and surgical debridement is not necessary in all cases of fungal orbital pseudotumor.
* Option D: Perform orbital exenteration is incorrect because orbital exenteration is a very aggressive procedure that is not necessary in most cases of fungal orbital pseudotumor.

The patient is an elderly male with a history of cutaneous melanoma in his 2 sisters, daughter, and nephew and breast cancer in his mother and sister. This suggests that he has a genetic predisposition to cancer. The main genes tested were the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1), breast cancer 2–DNA repair associated (BRCA2), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) genes. All of these genes are involved in the repair of DNA damage. Mutations in these genes can lead to the accumulation of genetic damage, which can eventually lead to cancer.

The patient's dermoscopic examination showed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast. Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast is the most common type of breast cancer. It is a cancer that starts in the ducts that carry milk from the breast to the nipple.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history, dermoscopic findings, or genetic testing results.

PTTMA is a rare, life-threatening disorder that occurs when cancer cells release substances that damage the blood vessels in the lungs. This can lead to blood clots, which can block the flow of blood to the lungs and cause respiratory failure.

The patient in the case presented with a number of symptoms that are consistent with PTTMA, including dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and genital skin lesions. The patient also had a history of lung adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can spread to the lungs and cause PTTMA.

The patient's chest X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates, which are areas of inflammation in the lungs that can be caused by PTTMA. The patient's electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rhythm that can be caused by PTTMA. The patient's echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, but mild right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe tricuspid regurgitation, which are all signs of right-sided heart failure that can be caused by PTTMA. The patient's computed tomography scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities and right basilar consolidations, which are areas of inflammation and consolidation in the lungs that can be caused by PTTMA. The patient's autopsy showed proliferation of intimal fibromuscular cells with or without the presence of Paget cells. Paget cells are a type of cancer cell that can be found in PTTMA.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with the diagnosis of PTTMA. The patient's chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and computed tomography scan are also consistent with the diagnosis of PTTMA. The patient's autopsy showed the presence of Paget cells, which is a definitive diagnosis of PTTMA.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or findings.

A. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a condition in which the left ventricle, the main pumping chamber of the heart, does not contract properly. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. However, left ventricular systolic dysfunction does not explain the patient's genital skin lesions or the presence of Paget cells in her lungs.

B. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect many organs in the body, including the lungs. Sarcoidosis can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight loss. However, sarcoidosis does not explain the patient's genital skin lesions or the presence of Paget cells in her lungs.

D. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which blood clots block the flow of blood to the lungs. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. However, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension does not explain the patient's genital skin lesions or the presence of Paget cells in her lungs.

The patient has a large circumferential pericardial effusion with diastolic right ventricular collapse. This is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent intervention. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the pericardial sac to drain the fluid. This can be done under ultrasound guidance to ensure that the needle is inserted in the correct location. Pericardiocentesis is a safe and effective procedure that can relieve the symptoms and prevent complications of a pericardial effusion.

Urgent referral for cardiovascular surgery is not the correct answer because the patient does not have a cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition in which the pericardial sac fills with fluid so rapidly that it compresses the heart and prevents it from beating effectively. This is a surgical emergency that requires immediate pericardiocentesis or surgery to remove the fluid. The patient in this case does not have cardiac tamponade, so urgent referral for cardiovascular surgery is not necessary.

Urgent vascular surgery referral for IVC stent removal is not the correct answer because the IVC stent is not causing the patient's symptoms. The IVC stent was placed 9 years earlier to treat intrahepatic caval compression due to hepatic cysts. The patient's current symptoms are caused by the pericardial effusion, not the IVC stent. Removing the IVC stent would not relieve the patient's symptoms and could potentially make her condition worse.

Initiation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine and observation is not the correct answer because the patient has a life-threatening condition that requires urgent intervention. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine are medications that can be used to treat pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the pericardium. However, they are not effective in treating a pericardial effusion. In addition, observation is not an appropriate management strategy for a patient with a life-threatening condition.

 27%|██▋       | 406/1525 [1:39:58<4:14:02, 13.62s/it]The correct diagnosis is IgG4-related disease.

IgG4-related disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into various organs and tissues. It can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the salivary glands, lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas.

The symptoms of IgG4-related disease vary depending on the organs involved. In the case of laryngeal involvement, the patient may present with odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Treatment for IgG4-related disease is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing complications. This may include the use of steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or surgery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare condition that is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer. The symptoms of laryngeal tuberculosis include hoarseness, dysphagia, and stridor. The diagnosis is made based on a history of exposure to tuberculosis, clinical findings, and laboratory tests. Treatment for laryngeal tuberculosis includes a combination of antibiotics and supportive care.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect any organ system in the body. The symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus vary depending on the organs involved. In the case of laryngeal involvement, the patient may present with hoarseness, dysphagia, and stridor. The diagnosis is made based on a history of symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory tests. Treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus includes a combination of medications to suppress the immune system.
* Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels. It can affect any organ system in the body, but the most common sites of involvement are the lungs, heart, and kidneys. The symptoms of Churg-Strauss syndrome vary depending on the organs involved. In the case of laryngeal involvement, the patient may present with hoarseness, dysphagia, and stridor. The diagnosis is made based on a history of symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory tests. Treatment for Churg-Strauss syndrome includes a combination of medications to suppress the immune system.

Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus bodies, which are small, specialized cells that regulate blood flow. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, particularly the nose, but can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the hands and feet.

Glomus tumors are typically small, round, and firm. They are often painful, especially when exposed to cold temperatures. The pain may radiate to the face, jaw, or teeth. Other symptoms may include nasal congestion, bleeding, and a stuffy nose.

Glomus tumors are diagnosed with a biopsy, which is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope. Treatment for glomus tumors typically involves surgical removal. Radiation therapy may be used in some cases.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Inverted papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium, which is the type of tissue that lines the inside of the nose. It is most commonly found in the middle meatus, which is a passage in the nose that connects the nasal cavity to the sinuses. Inverted papillomas are typically small, but can grow to be large. They are often associated with chronic inflammation of the sinuses.
* Hemangiopericytoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the pericytes, which are cells that surround blood vessels. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the soft tissues of the extremities. Hemangiopericytomas are often aggressive tumors that can metastasize to other parts of the body.
* Paraganglioma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are found throughout the body. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, particularly the carotid body, which is a small structure that is located at the bifurcation of the carotid artery. Paragangliomas are often associated with endocrine disorders, such as pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal glands.

It is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the nasal mucosa, larynx, and other parts of the upper respiratory tract. The disease is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, and is rarely seen in the United States.

The patient in the case presented with a history of nasal congestion, dysphonia, and dyspnea. On physical examination, he had large, bilateral obstructive nasal polyps and smooth, lobulated masses involving the epiglottis and right aryepiglottic fold. The epiglottic component extended inferiorly along the petiole, involving and obstructing the anterior glottis. The vocal fold mucosa was thickened, but bilateral mobility was intact with an adequate posterior glottic airway. Computed tomography demonstrated homogenous, isodense, laryngeal lesions that correlated with the previously mentioned laryngoscopy findings, but also showed subglottic stenosis approximately 2 cm in length secondary to the thickened intraluminal soft tissue. The cartilaginous laryngotracheal framework was preserved. The chest radiograph was unremarkable.

The patient was taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy with endoscopic airway dilation and laryngeal mass biopsy. The biopsy results showed vacuolated macrophages with bacilli (yellow arrowhead) and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells (black arrowhead) (hematoxylin-eosin).

The clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and biopsy results are all consistent with a diagnosis of rhinoscleroma. The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in various tissues and organs. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, and peripheral neuropathy. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical symptoms of amyloidosis, and the biopsy results do not show any evidence of amyloid deposition.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the small and medium-sized arteries. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, weight loss, arthralgia, and skin rash. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical symptoms of GPA, and the biopsy results do not show any evidence of vasculitis.
* Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas in various tissues and organs. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including lung disease, skin lesions, and eye problems. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical symptoms of sarcoidosis, and the biopsy results do not show any evidence of granulomas.

Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor of salivary glands. It is composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and it typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass. The tumor is usually well-circumscribed and can be removed surgically.

Angioleiomyoma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is composed of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, and it typically presents as a small, asymptomatic mass. The tumor is usually well-circumscribed and can be removed surgically.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor of salivary glands. It is composed of a mixture of mucous cells, epidermoid cells, and intermediate cells, and it typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass. The tumor can spread to lymph nodes and other organs, and it is often treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a cancer of B cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The tumor can spread to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs. It is often treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

The patient in this case presents with a diffuse, right-sided palatal swelling with a focal ulceration. The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable. An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed and showed fibrous connective tissues infiltrated by inflammatory cells arranged in a diffuse, sheetlike pattern. The cells were large with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and appeared to be round to oval vesicular nuclei with vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli. The cells stained positively with CD45, CD20, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results are all consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient should be referred to a hematologist-oncologist for further management.

 27%|██▋       | 410/1525 [1:41:00<4:44:48, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is D. Pneumoparotid.

A. Esophageal perforation is a rare but serious condition that occurs when a hole develops in the esophagus. This can be caused by a number of things, including trauma, foreign objects, and certain medical procedures. Symptoms of esophageal perforation can include chest pain, abdominal pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. Treatment for esophageal perforation usually involves surgery to repair the hole.

B. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but serious infection that can cause death if not treated promptly. This infection is caused by bacteria that enter the skin through a break in the skin, such as a cut or burn. Symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis can include fever, chills, severe pain, and redness, swelling, and tenderness of the skin. Treatment for necrotizing fasciitis usually involves surgery to remove the infected tissue and antibiotics.

C. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a condition that occurs when air leaks into the mediastinum, the space between the lungs. This can be caused by a number of things, including coughing, straining, and certain medical procedures. Symptoms of spontaneous pneumomediastinum can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and a feeling of fullness in the chest. Treatment for spontaneous pneumomediastinum usually involves rest and supportive care.

D. Pneumoparotid is a condition that occurs when air leaks into the parotid gland, a gland that is located in front of the ear. This can be caused by a number of things, including trauma, foreign objects, and certain medical procedures. Symptoms of pneumoparotid can include swelling, pain, and tenderness of the parotid gland. Treatment for pneumoparotid usually involves rest and supportive care.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and history are consistent with pneumoparotid. The patient noted a week of worsening facial swelling, neck pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. Importantly, the patient noted that he was capable of a “party trick” which involved puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck with subsequent decompression of air back into his oral cavity by pushing behind his ear. This became a habitual behavior, which the patient performed multiple times per day. On examination, there was a tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible without significant crepitus. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of pneumoparotid.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and history. Esophageal perforation would not cause the patient to have a “party trick” that involves puffing out his cheeks and forcing air into his neck. Necrotizing fasciitis would cause the patient to have severe pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness of the skin. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum would not cause the patient to have a tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible.

 27%|██▋       | 411/1525 [1:41:15<4:40:42, 15.12s/it]The correct answer is D. Reassure the patient and observe.

The patient in the case presented has rifabutin-related posterior corneal deposits. These deposits are a known side effect of rifabutin, and they are typically asymptomatic and do not affect vision. In most cases, the deposits will resolve on their own over time.

There is no evidence that starting treatment with topical corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, or performing a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy will improve the outcome of this patient. In fact, these interventions may actually worsen the condition.

Therefore, the best course of action is to reassure the patient and observe the deposits. If the deposits do not resolve on their own, or if they begin to affect vision, then further treatment may be necessary.

Here are some more details about each of the answer choices:

* A. Start treatment with topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation. However, there is no evidence that they are effective in treating rifabutin-related posterior corneal deposits. In fact, corticosteroids may actually worsen the condition by increasing the risk of cataracts and glaucoma.
* B. Start treatment with topical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics are often used to treat infections. However, there is no evidence that there is an infection present in this patient. In addition, topical antibiotics may actually worsen the condition by increasing the risk of corneal ulceration.
* C. Plan a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy: A descemetorhexis is a surgical procedure that involves removing the Descemet membrane, which is the innermost layer of the cornea. A posterior cornea biopsy is a biopsy of the posterior cornea. These procedures are typically only performed if there is a suspicion of an underlying condition, such as an infection or a tumor. In this case, there is no evidence of an underlying condition, so these procedures would not be necessary.
* D. Reassure the patient and observe: This is the best course of action in this case. The patient should be reassured that the deposits are a known side effect of rifabutin and that they are typically asymptomatic and do not affect vision. The patient should also be advised to return for follow-up visits to monitor the condition.

 27%|██▋       | 412/1525 [1:41:26<4:15:22, 13.77s/it]The correct answer is blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents. This is because the patient has a history of cyclical fevers, muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache. These symptoms are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process. Blood testing can help to identify the specific cause of the inflammation or infection, which can then be treated.

Magnetic resonance angiography of the neck is not the correct answer because there is no evidence of a vascular problem in this patient. The MRI of the orbits showed anterior swelling of the left optic nerve without masses or hyperintensity of the retrobulbar optic nerve. Brain MRI results were normal. These findings do not suggest a vascular problem.

Treatment with oral prednisone is not the correct answer because the patient does not have a confirmed diagnosis of an inflammatory disorder. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. However, it is important to identify the specific cause of the inflammation before starting treatment with prednisone.

Observation is not the correct answer because the patient has a history of cyclical fevers, muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache. These symptoms are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process. It is important to identify the specific cause of the inflammation or infection so that it can be treated.

In summary, the correct answer is blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents. This is because the patient has a history of cyclical fevers, muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache. These symptoms are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process. Blood testing can help to identify the specific cause of the inflammation or infection, which can then be treated.

The patient in the case has a number of risk factors for retinal pigment abnormalities, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid cancer. In addition, the patient's mother had a history of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a common eye disease that can cause vision loss in older adults. There are several genetic variants that have been associated with AMD.

Obtaining a family medical history can help to identify other family members who may be at risk for AMD. Genetic testing can be used to determine if the patient carries one or more of the genetic variants that are associated with AMD. If the patient does carry a genetic variant, this information can be used to develop a personalized treatment plan.

Initiating AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) nutritional supplement treatment for AMD is not the correct answer because the patient does not have AMD. AMD is a disease that affects the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for central vision. The patient in the case has retinal pigment abnormalities, which are changes in the pigmentation of the retina. Retinal pigment abnormalities can be caused by a number of conditions, including AMD, diabetes, and hypertension.

Monitoring retinal pigment abnormalities without further workup is not the correct answer because the patient has a number of risk factors for AMD. In addition, the patient's mother had a history of AMD. AMD is a progressive disease, meaning that it can get worse over time. It is important to monitor patients with retinal pigment abnormalities closely to detect any changes that may indicate the development of AMD.

Referring for intensification of oral therapy for type 2 diabetes is not the correct answer because the patient's diabetes is well-controlled on metformin therapy. In addition, the patient's retinal pigment abnormalities are not likely to be caused by her diabetes.

The patient is a 19-year-old man with recurrent left eye redness and photophobia for the past year. He had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits. Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate. Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.

The most likely diagnosis is ocular juvenile xanthogranuloma (OJXG). OJXG is a rare, non-neoplastic, granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that typically affects children under the age of 6. It can involve the skin, eyes, central nervous system, and other organs. The ocular manifestations of OJXG include anterior uveitis, iris nodules, and retinal vasculitis.

The treatment of OJXG is generally supportive. Topical corticosteroids may be used to control inflammation. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary. Surgical intervention may be required for complications such as cataract formation or glaucoma.

In the case presented, the patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of OJXG. The next step in management is to perform a biopsy of the iris lesion to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. A biopsy will also allow for the identification of the specific cell type involved in the inflammatory process, which can help to guide treatment decisions.

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this case. Option B, administering subtenon corticosteroid injection, is not likely to be effective in treating OJXG. Option C, performing anterior chamber paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction, is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of a viral infection. Option D, screening for antinuclear antibody, is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of an autoimmune disorder.

The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a 2-year history of progressively worsening intermittent dysphagia, primarily to solids, especially meats, localized retrosternally. She reported no heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. She reported no medications or comorbidities. Physical examination was unremarkable. Results of a recent complete blood cell count were normal. Despite taking ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), she continued to have bothersome daily dysphagia, prompting her primary care clinician to order esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The EGD showed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus, while the stomach and duodenum appeared normal. Four biopsies each were taken from the proximal and distal esophagus.

The most likely diagnosis is achalasia, a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and ineffective peristalsis in the distal esophagus. Achalasia is typically treated with pneumatic dilation or surgery, but medical therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole can be used as an initial treatment option. PPIs work by inhibiting the production of gastric acid, which can help to reduce symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Barium esophagram is a radiographic study of the esophagus that can be used to evaluate for structural abnormalities such as strictures or tumors. However, it is not a sensitive test for achalasia and is not recommended as a first-line diagnostic test.
* Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) is a test that measures pressure changes in the esophagus. It is a more sensitive test for achalasia than barium esophagram, but it is not always necessary to perform HRM before starting treatment with a PPI.
* Surgical fundoplication is a surgical procedure that involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus. It is a definitive treatment for achalasia, but it is a more invasive procedure than treatment with a PPI. It is typically reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy or who have complications of achalasia such as esophageal dilation or aspiration pneumonia.

Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare, autoimmune skin disease characterized by linear deposits of IgA antibodies in the basement membrane zone of the skin. It typically presents as a well-demarcated, erythematous plaque with blisters and pustules, often in a linear or annular pattern. The most common location is the trunk, but it can occur anywhere on the body.

The cause of linear IgA dermatosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune reaction. It is associated with a number of underlying conditions, including infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and malignancy.

The diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis is made based on clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is with oral steroids and/or topical steroids.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Annular pustular psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that presents as annular plaques with central clearing and peripheral pustules. It is not associated with linear deposits of IgA antibodies.
* Bullous tinea is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause blisters and pustules. It is not associated with linear deposits of IgA antibodies.

A spindle cell lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells that is characterized by the presence of spindle-shaped cells. It is most commonly found in the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk and extremities, but can also occur in other locations, such as the head and neck. Spindle cell lipomas are usually asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause pain or discomfort. They are typically diagnosed on the basis of a clinical examination and a biopsy. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be performed if the tumor is large or causing symptoms.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus) is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. It is characterized by the presence of erythema, tenderness, and swelling in the affected area. Lupus panniculitis can be difficult to diagnose, and is often mistaken for other conditions, such as cellulitis or panniculitis. Treatment typically involves the use of immunosuppressive medications.
* Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare type of skin cancer that is characterized by the growth of a firm, red or brown nodule. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is usually found on the lower extremities, but can also occur on other parts of the body. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor.
* Diffuse pattern neurofibroma is a type of neurofibroma that is characterized by the growth of multiple, small, soft tumors. Diffuse pattern neurofibromas are most commonly found in people with neurofibromatosis type 1.

Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a genetic disorder that causes the skin to be very fragile. The slightest touch can cause blisters and open sores. DEB is not caused by mast cells.

Chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC) is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes blisters to form on the skin. CBDC is not caused by mast cells.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells. CEP can cause blisters and other skin problems, but it is not caused by mast cells.

Bullous mastocytosis is a rare condition that causes blisters to form on the skin. The blisters are caused by a build-up of mast cells in the skin. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that release chemicals that can cause inflammation and itching.

The patient in the case presented with recurrent skin blisters, pruritus, and redness all over the body. These are all symptoms of bullous mastocytosis. The patient also had a positive punch biopsy for mast cells. This is further evidence that the patient has bullous mastocytosis.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of schizophrenia, including auditory hallucinations, delusions, and social withdrawal. These symptoms are likely to be causing her significant distress and impairment in her daily life. Treatment with antipsychotic medication is the standard of care for schizophrenia. However, it is important to consider the risks and benefits of all treatment options before making a decision.

Antipsychotic medications can be effective in reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, they can also cause side effects, such as weight gain, sedation, and movement disorders. Some antipsychotic medications, such as clozapine, have a higher risk of side effects than others. It is important to discuss the potential side effects of antipsychotic medications with the patient before starting treatment.

It is also important to consider the patient's individual circumstances when making a decision about treatment. For example, if the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, some antipsychotic medications may not be safe to use. If the patient has a history of substance abuse, some antipsychotic medications may be more likely to be misused.

The best way to determine which antipsychotic medication is right for the patient is to discuss her individual circumstances with a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist can help the patient weigh the risks and benefits of different treatment options and make an informed decision about her care.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not represent the standard of care for schizophrenia.

B. Commence treatment with oral olanzapine is incorrect because olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication, and it is important to consider the risks and benefits of all treatment options before making a decision.

C. Commence treatment with oral clozapine is incorrect because clozapine is an antipsychotic medication, and it is important to consider the risks and benefits of all treatment options before making a decision.

The patient in the case presented with a number of symptoms and findings that are consistent with this diagnosis, including:

* Fever of unknown origin
* Night sweats
* Unintentional weight loss
* Pancytopenia
* Splenomegaly
* Diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow and spleen on PET-CT imaging
* A bone-marrow biopsy showing a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements
* Immunostaining showing lymphoid infiltrate strongly positive for paired box protein Pax-5

Infectious bone-marrow disease is an unlikely diagnosis in this case given the patient's age, lack of risk factors for infection, and the absence of other signs or symptoms of infection.

Primary bone lymphoma is also an unlikely diagnosis in this case given the patient's age, lack of risk factors for bone cancer, and the absence of other signs or symptoms of bone cancer.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case given the patient's age, lack of risk factors for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and the absence of other signs or symptoms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

The patient in this case has a history of bulimia, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte imbalances can cause a variety of cardiac arrhythmias, including wide complex tachycardia. The patient also has an elevated serum troponin level, which can be a marker of myocardial injury.

A coronary angiogram is not indicated in this patient because she does not have any symptoms or signs of coronary artery disease. An ambulatory cardiac monitor is not indicated after electrolyte repletion because the patient's arrhythmia has already been resolved. An invasive electrophysiology study is not indicated because the patient's arrhythmia is not sustained and she does not have any structural heart disease.

Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. It can also be used to identify the cause of cardiac arrhythmias. In this case, cardiac MRI would be the best test to evaluate the patient's heart for any structural abnormalities that could be causing her arrhythmia.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* **Coronary angiography:** This is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and threaded up to the heart. A dye is then injected into the arteries, which allows the doctor to see if there are any blockages. Coronary angiography is not indicated in this patient because she does not have any symptoms or signs of coronary artery disease.
* **Ambulatory cardiac monitoring:** This is a test in which the patient wears a Holter monitor for a period of time, usually 24 hours. The monitor records the patient's heart rhythm throughout the day and night. Ambulatory cardiac monitoring is not indicated after electrolyte repletion because the patient's arrhythmia has already been resolved.
* **Invasive electrophysiology study:** This is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into a vein in the groin and threaded up to the heart. The catheter is then used to stimulate the heart and record the electrical activity of the heart. An invasive electrophysiology study is not indicated in this patient because her arrhythmia is not sustained and she does not have any structural heart disease.

 28%|██▊       | 422/1525 [1:43:57<4:54:03, 16.00s/it]The correct answer is C. Lateral saccular cyst.

A granular cell tumor is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the skin, larynx, and tongue. It is thought to arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and insulate nerve fibers. Granular cell tumors are usually asymptomatic, but can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing or breathing if they are large enough. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

A laryngeal neurofibroma is a benign tumor that can occur in the larynx, the voice box. It is thought to arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and insulate nerve fibers. Laryngeal neurofibromas are usually asymptomatic, but can cause hoarseness, stridor, and difficulty breathing if they are large enough. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

A lateral saccular cyst is a rare, benign cyst that can occur in the larynx, the voice box. It is thought to arise from a defect in the development of the larynx. Lateral saccular cysts are usually asymptomatic, but can cause hoarseness, stridor, and difficulty breathing if they are large enough. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

A macrocystic lymphatic malformation is a rare, benign condition that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the head and neck. It is thought to arise from a defect in the development of the lymphatic system. Macrocystic lymphatic malformations are usually asymptomatic, but can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing or breathing if they are large enough. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

In the case of the newborn with stridor and respiratory distress, the most likely diagnosis is a lateral saccular cyst. This is because lateral saccular cysts are the most common type of cyst to occur in the larynx, and they are more likely to cause symptoms in newborns than other types of cysts. The other choices, granular cell tumor, laryngeal neurofibroma, and macrocystic lymphatic malformation, are all less likely to occur in newborns and are less likely to cause symptoms.

 28%|██▊       | 423/1525 [1:44:13<4:55:41, 16.10s/it]The correct answer is D. Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in adults. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it is only made after other more common tumors have been ruled out. MFH is typically characterized by a mixture of spindle cells, histiocytes, and giant cells. In this case, the patient's tumor was composed of spindle cells only, which is not typical of MFH. Additionally, the patient's tumor expressed myogenin, which is a marker of skeletal muscle differentiation. MFH does not typically express myogenin.

Paraganglioma is a rare tumor that can occur in the head and neck. It is typically composed of small, round cells that are positive for neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. In this case, the patient's tumor was composed of spindle cells, which is not typical of paraganglioma. Additionally, the patient's tumor did not express neuroendocrine markers.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer. It typically occurs in the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the presence of keratin, which is a protein that is found in the outer layer of skin. In this case, the patient's tumor did not express keratin.

Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of sarcoma that typically occurs in children. It is characterized by the presence of spindle cells that are positive for myogenin, desmin, and other muscle markers. In this case, the patient's tumor was composed of spindle cells that were positive for myogenin, desmin, and CD34. Additionally, the tumor focally infiltrated into the fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

 28%|██▊       | 424/1525 [1:44:30<4:59:09, 16.30s/it]The correct answer is D. Midline anterior neck inclusion cyst.

A midline anterior neck inclusion cyst is a type of congenital cyst that occurs in the midline of the anterior neck. It is thought to develop when epithelial cells from the lining of the pharynx become trapped during embryonic development. The cyst can be filled with fluid or keratinous debris, and it is usually asymptomatic. However, it can sometimes become infected or rupture, which can lead to pain, swelling, and infection.

The diagnosis of a midline anterior neck inclusion cyst is usually made based on clinical examination and imaging studies such as ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT). If the diagnosis is uncertain, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of a midline anterior neck inclusion cyst is usually surgical excision. This can be performed as an open procedure or laparoscopically. The goal of surgery is to remove the cyst completely, while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissues.

The prognosis for patients with a midline anterior neck inclusion cyst is generally good. Most patients experience no long-term problems following surgery. However, there is a small risk of recurrence, which can occur if the cyst is not completely removed.

A. Eruptive vellus hair cyst is a type of skin cyst that is caused by blockage of hair follicles. It is characterized by multiple small, white or yellow papules that are found on the face, neck, and trunk. The papules are usually asymptomatic, but they can sometimes become inflamed or infected.

B. Thyroglossal duct cyst is a type of congenital cyst that occurs in the midline of the neck. It is thought to develop when the thyroglossal duct, which is a structure that forms during embryonic development, fails to regress. The cyst can be filled with fluid or keratinous debris, and it is usually asymptomatic. However, it can sometimes become infected or rupture, which can lead to pain, swelling, and infection.

C. Cutaneous bronchogenic cyst is a rare type of congenital cyst that occurs in the skin. It is thought to develop when cells from the lung bud become trapped during embryonic development. The cyst can be filled with fluid or air, and it is usually asymptomatic. However, it can sometimes become infected or rupture, which can lead to pain, swelling, and infection.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Midline anterior neck inclusion cyst. The other choices are incorrect because they are not associated with the clinical presentation described in the case.

 28%|██▊       | 425/1525 [1:44:46<4:55:40, 16.13s/it]The correct answer is B. Hibernoma.

A hibernoma is a rare type of benign (noncancerous) tumor that is made up of fat cells. It is most commonly found in the neck, shoulder, and back. Hibernomas are usually small, but they can grow to be quite large. They are usually slow-growing and do not spread to other parts of the body.

The symptoms of a hibernoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people may experience pain, swelling, or a lump in the neck. Others may have no symptoms at all.

The diagnosis of a hibernoma is usually made with a CT scan or MRI. A biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of a hibernoma depends on the size and location of the tumor. Small tumors may be removed surgically. Larger tumors may be treated with radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

The prognosis for people with hibernomas is good. Most people recover completely after treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are all types of cancerous tumors. Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that is made up of fat cells. Angiolipoma is a type of benign tumor that is made up of fat cells and blood vessels. Lipoma is a type of benign tumor that is made up of fat cells.

In the case of the patient in the question, the diagnosis of hibernoma was made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as the results of the CT scan and MRI. The biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical excision of the tumor, which was found to be benign. The patient's symptoms resolved after surgery, and she made a full recovery.

 28%|██▊       | 426/1525 [1:45:02<4:57:55, 16.27s/it]The correct answer is C. Stop the ATRA and start steroids.

The patient in this case has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. APL is treated with a combination of chemotherapy drugs, including all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA is a drug that helps to convert the abnormal white blood cells into normal cells. However, ATRA can also cause a condition called retinoic acid syndrome (RAS), which is a serious complication that can lead to blindness.

RAS is characterized by fever, weight gain, fluid retention, and respiratory distress. It can also cause inflammation of the eyes, which can lead to blindness. In some cases, RAS can be fatal.

The patient in this case presented with sudden loss of vision, which is a classic symptom of RAS. The patient's history of APL and recent treatment with ATRA make RAS the most likely diagnosis.

The treatment for RAS is to stop the ATRA and start steroids. Steroids help to reduce the inflammation and swelling that are associated with RAS. They also help to protect the eyes from damage.

In most cases, stopping the ATRA and starting steroids will resolve RAS. However, in some cases, RAS can be life-threatening. If the patient does not improve with treatment, he may need to be treated with other medications, such as cyclophosphamide or vincristine.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

Choice A, continue chemotherapy therapy and observe, is incorrect because it would not treat the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss.

Choice B, order magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture, is incorrect because these tests would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating RAS.

Choice D, send HLA-B51 and start steroids, is incorrect because HLA-B51 is a genetic marker that is associated with an increased risk of developing RAS. However, the patient in this case already has APL, so testing for HLA-B51 would not be helpful.
It is reasoning
 28%|██▊       | 427/1525 [1:45:16<4:43:51, 15.51s/it]The correct answer is C. Administer intravitreal foscarnet and initiate valganciclovir.

The patient's history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that was diagnosed 3 years earlier, followed by a relapse that required additional chemotherapy and ultimately autologous bone marrow transplant 3 months before presentation, places him at increased risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. The patient's clinical presentation, with subacute, painless vision loss in the right eye that developed over the course of 1 week, is consistent with CMV retinitis. The patient's examination findings, including 1+ anterior chamber inflammation, iris neovascularization, keratic precipitates, vitritis, and a granular necrotizing retinitis, are also consistent with CMV retinitis. The patient's laboratory findings, including a moderately low white blood cell count and a negative HIV test, are not helpful in making the diagnosis of CMV retinitis. The patient's aqueous tap findings, which demonstrated CMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction, are diagnostic of CMV retinitis.

The treatment of choice for CMV retinitis in a patient with a history of bone marrow transplantation is intravitreal foscarnet and oral valganciclovir. Intravitreal foscarnet is a potent antiviral agent that is effective against CMV. Oral valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir, another potent antiviral agent that is effective against CMV. The combination of intravitreal foscarnet and oral valganciclovir has been shown to be more effective than either agent alone in the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with bone marrow transplantation.

Administering intravitreal clindamycin would not be appropriate in this case. Clindamycin is an antibiotic that is not effective against CMV. Administering intravenous acyclovir would not be appropriate in this case. Acyclovir is an antiviral agent that is effective against herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus, but it is not effective against CMV. Administering an intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent followed by panretinal photocoagulation would not be appropriate in this case. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents and panretinal photocoagulation are used to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration, but they are not effective against CMV retinitis.

A. Administering intralesional corticosteroids is not the correct answer because the lesion is not inflammatory in nature. It is a rapidly enlarging fleshy nodule, which is suspicious for a malignant neoplasm. Corticosteroids are not indicated for the treatment of malignant neoplasms.

C. Administering topical antibiotics is not the correct answer because the lesion is not infected. It is a rapidly enlarging fleshy nodule, which is suspicious for a malignant neoplasm. Topical antibiotics are not indicated for the treatment of malignant neoplasms.

D. Obtaining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is not the correct answer because the lesion is limited to the conjunctiva. There is no evidence of systemic involvement. MRI is not indicated for the evaluation of a localized conjunctival lesion.

The most appropriate management for this patient is to perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

 28%|██▊       | 429/1525 [1:45:42<4:17:20, 14.09s/it]The correct answer is C. Start oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy.

The patient has a history of herpes simplex keratitis, which is a viral infection of the cornea. The current presentation of corneal edema, central ulceration, and positive bacterial cultures suggests that the patient has a secondary bacterial infection. Therefore, it is necessary to start both oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy to treat the viral and bacterial infections, respectively.

Starting only topical antibiotics would not be sufficient to treat the viral infection. Additionally, starting only oral antiviral therapy would not be sufficient to treat the bacterial infection. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Start oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* Answer A: Start topical antibiotics. This is not the correct answer because the patient has a history of herpes simplex keratitis, which is a viral infection. Topical antibiotics are not effective against viral infections.
* Answer B: Start oral antiviral therapy. This is not the correct answer because the patient has a secondary bacterial infection. Oral antiviral therapy would not be sufficient to treat the bacterial infection.
* Answer C: Start oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy. This is the correct answer because the patient has both a viral and bacterial infection. Oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy are both necessary to treat these infections.
* Answer D: Admit patient for intravenous antiviral therapy. This is not the correct answer because the patient's condition is not severe enough to require hospitalization. The patient can be treated with oral and topical medications as an outpatient.

 28%|██▊       | 430/1525 [1:45:57<4:18:46, 14.18s/it]The correct answer is A. Begin antimicrobial therapy.

The patient has developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Whipple's disease, which is a rare, chronic, multisystem disorder caused by infection with the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. Whipple's disease is characterized by the infiltration of the small intestine with macrophages that contain PAS-positive bacilli.

The mainstay of treatment for Whipple's disease is antimicrobial therapy with antibiotics such as penicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Treatment should be continued for at least 12 weeks to eradicate the infection. In addition to antimicrobial therapy, patients may also require treatment for other complications of Whipple's disease, such as malabsorption, malnutrition, and joint pain.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for Whipple's disease.

* Option B: Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is not the most appropriate treatment for Whipple's disease because it does not target the underlying infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may be used to treat other conditions, such as primary immunodeficiency disorders, but it is not effective in treating Whipple's disease.
* Option C: Perform genetic analysis for evaluation of hematologic malignancy is not the most appropriate treatment for Whipple's disease because it is not a hematologic malignancy. Whipple's disease is a multisystem disorder that can affect the small intestine, heart, brain, and other organs. Genetic analysis may be useful in diagnosing other conditions, such as hematologic malignancies, but it is not necessary in diagnosing Whipple's disease.
* Option D: Refer to a nutritionist for education on gluten-free diet is not the most appropriate treatment for Whipple's disease because gluten is not a trigger for Whipple's disease. Whipple's disease is caused by infection with the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei, not by gluten. A gluten-free diet may be helpful for patients with other conditions, such as celiac disease, but it is not necessary for patients with Whipple's disease.

 28%|██▊       | 431/1525 [1:46:13<4:30:09, 14.82s/it]The correct answer is B. Prescribe antibiotics followed by anthelminthic therapy.

The patient has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, which puts her at increased risk for bacterial cholangitis. The presence of fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice is concerning for cholangitis. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) shows a linear filling defect within the common bile duct, which is consistent with a biliary obstruction. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows numerous worms within the biliary trees, which are consistent with Ascaris infection.

Ascaris is a nematode (roundworm) that can infect humans. The worms typically live in the small intestine, but they can migrate to other parts of the body, including the biliary tree. This can lead to cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. Cholangitis can be a serious infection, and it can lead to complications such as liver abscess, sepsis, and death.

The treatment for Ascaris infection is to kill the worms with an anthelminthic drug. However, if the worms have migrated to the biliary tree, it is important to treat the infection with antibiotics to prevent cholangitis. The antibiotics will kill the bacteria that are causing the infection, and the anthelminthic drug will kill the worms.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Prescribe anthelminthic therapy alone. This would not be effective because the antibiotics are needed to treat the bacterial infection.

C. Order polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris. This would not be helpful because the diagnosis of Ascaris infection is already made on the basis of the history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and ERCP findings.

D. Order serum serologic testing for Ascaris. This would not be helpful because the serum serologic test is not sensitive or specific for Ascaris infection.

 28%|██▊       | 432/1525 [1:46:28<4:31:40, 14.91s/it]The correct answer is C. Discontinue ibuprofen.

The patient has a history of recurrent herpetic lesions on the lower lip, which are most likely caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a common virus that can cause a variety of symptoms, including blisters, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The virus is spread through contact with infected saliva or skin lesions.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to treat pain and inflammation. However, NSAIDs can also trigger a recurrence of HSV infection in some people. This is because NSAIDs can suppress the immune system, making it easier for the virus to replicate.

In this case, the patient's symptoms began after she took ibuprofen. This suggests that ibuprofen may have triggered a recurrence of her HSV infection. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to discontinue ibuprofen and monitor the patient's symptoms. If the symptoms do not improve, the patient may need to be treated with antiviral medication.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Administer valacyclovir is incorrect because the patient does not have a current herpes infection. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes infections. However, it is not effective in preventing herpes infections.
* B. Discontinue all cosmetics is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not likely caused by cosmetics. Cosmetics can sometimes trigger allergic reactions, but these reactions usually do not cause blisters.
* D. Administer antibiotics is incorrect because the patient does not have an infection that requires antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, but herpes infections are caused by viruses.

Onchocerciasis is an infection caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blackfly. The most common symptoms of onchocerciasis are skin rashes, itching, and eye problems. Onchocerciasis is not a likely diagnosis in this case because the patient did not report any of the typical symptoms, such as skin rashes or eye problems.

Periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis is a skin condition that is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. It is characterized by the formation of small, red bumps around the mouth, nose, and eyes. Periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis is not a likely diagnosis in this case because the patient did not report any of the typical symptoms, such as red bumps around the mouth, nose, and eyes.

Granuloma inguinale is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by the bacterium Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. It is characterized by the formation of large, ulcerated sores on the genitals. Granuloma inguinale is not a likely diagnosis in this case because the patient did not report any of the typical symptoms, such as large, ulcerated sores on the genitals.

Late cutaneous bilharziasis is a chronic skin condition that is caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium. It is characterized by the formation of hard, raised bumps on the skin. Late cutaneous bilharziasis is a likely diagnosis in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with the condition. The patient's history includes living in a rural village in Malawi, where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic. The patient's physical examination reveals a polypoid, rubbery tumor measuring 1.5 cm located on her right labium majus, which obliterated the right labium minus. This is a typical presentation of late cutaneous bilharziasis. The histopathologic analysis of the nodule showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with transepidermal elimination of basophilic oval-shaped structures in the epidermis and a dense acute and chronic dermal infiltrate in the dermis. These findings are also consistent with late cutaneous bilharziasis.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and a characteristic skin rash. The rash is usually erythematous and tender, and it can be papular, nodular, or bullous. Sweet syndrome can occur in association with a variety of underlying conditions, including hematologic malignancies, infections, and connective tissue diseases.

Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is a rare, benign, inflammatory condition of the skin and lymph nodes. It is characterized by the presence of small, red, papular lesions on the skin, often on the face and neck. ALHE can also involve the lymph nodes, which can become enlarged and tender. The cause of ALHE is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to an infection or an allergic reaction.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected sandflies. Leishmaniasis can cause a variety of skin lesions, including ulcers, nodules, and plaques. The lesions can be painful and disfiguring. Leishmaniasis can also affect the internal organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 30s who presents with a 3-month history of gradual growth of a pruriginous, reddish nodule on the left ear. He had no relevant medical history. On medical examination, a reddish, smooth, superficial nodule with small dimples and a soft consistency that measured approximately 1.5 cm in diameter was seen on the left earlobe. It was not painful to the touch. The patient reported no history of lesions or foreign bodies at this location. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis. The histopathologic findings revealed mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone as well as the dilated vessel luminal, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of extrafacial granuloma faciale. Extrafacial granuloma faciale is a rare, benign, inflammatory condition of the skin that is characterized by the presence of small, red, papular lesions. The lesions are often located on the face and neck, but they can also occur on other parts of the body. Extrafacial granuloma faciale is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to an infection or an allergic reaction. The condition is usually self-limited, but it can recur.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

 29%|██▊       | 435/1525 [1:47:14<4:38:39, 15.34s/it]The correct answer is C. Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt.

A pulmonary arteriovenous shunt (PAVS) is a congenital or acquired abnormality in which there is a direct communication between the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein. This allows deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the systemic circulation.

The most common symptoms of a PAVS are cyanosis, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and dyspnea. Other symptoms may include fatigue, palpitations, and chest pain.

The diagnosis of a PAVS is made with a chest X-ray, CT scan, or MRI. A pulmonary angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosis.

The treatment of a PAVS depends on the size of the shunt and the symptoms. Small shunts may not require treatment. Larger shunts may be treated with surgery or embolization.

The prognosis for patients with a PAVS is good with treatment. However, untreated PAVS can lead to serious complications, such as heart failure, stroke, and brain abscess.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

* Encysted empyema thoracis is a collection of pus in the chest cavity. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The patient would likely have fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
* Lung abscess is a collection of pus in the lung. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The patient would likely have fever, cough, and chest pain.

 29%|██▊       | 436/1525 [1:47:30<4:43:54, 15.64s/it]The correct answer is C. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

The patient is a 27-year-old Asian man who presented with a 10-year history of painless masses on both Achilles tendons. He also had a 2-year history of indifference, glassy eyes, lethargy, and poor memory. One year prior, his personality changed dramatically, with notably decreased memory formation but intact short-term memory. He was short-tempered, irritable, hyperactive, and exhibited slight balance instability while walking.

On admission, physical examination showed unstable balance while walking in a straight line, positive ankle clonus bilaterally, positive Babinski sign bilaterally, positive Chaddock sign bilaterally, positive Romberg sign, and painless lumps of about 8.2 cm in diameter in both Achilles tendons. Routine laboratory test results showed that the patient's triglyceride level was elevated at 342.48 mg/dL. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated multiple bilateral, symmetric abnormal signals in the genus of the internal capsules, posterior limbs of internal capsules, cerebral peduncles, pons, and cerebellar dentate nuclei. Genetic testing indicated a known pathogenic mutation c.1214G>A (p.Arg405Gln; Hom) in the CYP27A1 gene. An MRI of the ankle joints revealed an enlargement of the left Achilles tendon with abnormal signal, and the right Achilles tendon was circumscribed by a fusiform enlargement with abnormal signal.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene. This gene encodes the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase, which is responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to cholestanol. In cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, the accumulation of cholestanol in the brain, tendons, and other tissues leads to a variety of clinical manifestations, including neurological problems, tendon xanthomas, and cataracts.

The diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is confirmed by genetic testing or by finding elevated levels of cholestanol in the blood and tissues. There is no cure for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment options include cholesterol-lowering medications, chelation therapy, and surgery to remove xanthomas.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Frontotemporal dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder that typically affects people in their 40s or 50s. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that causes the accumulation of copper in the body.

Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed images of the heart and its surrounding structures. It is the gold standard for the diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by a thin, poorly developed left ventricular myocardium.

Endomyocardial biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the heart muscle. It is used to diagnose a variety of heart conditions, including noncompaction cardiomyopathy. However, it is an invasive procedure with a risk of complications.

A whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that is used to detect cancer and other diseases. It is not a specific test for noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

Genetic testing is used to identify the genetic mutations that are associated with noncompaction cardiomyopathy. However, it is not a diagnostic test and should not be used to rule out the diagnosis.

In conclusion, cardiac MRI is the best test to diagnose noncompaction cardiomyopathy. It is a non-invasive test that provides detailed images of the heart. Endmyocardial biopsy and PET/CT scan are not specific tests for noncompaction cardiomyopathy and should not be used to diagnose the condition. Genetic testing is not a diagnostic test and should not be used to rule out the diagnosis.

Spindle cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of spindle-shaped cells. It is a rare tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Spindle cell carcinoma is a high-grade tumor with a poor prognosis.

Laryngeal granuloma is a benign inflammatory lesion of the larynx. It is most commonly caused by trauma, such as intubation or surgery. Laryngeal granulomas can also be caused by infection, allergies, or autoimmune disorders. Laryngeal granulomas are usually small and asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause hoarseness, stridor, or dysphagia.

Plasmacytoma of the larynx is a rare malignant neoplasm of plasma cells. It is most commonly seen in older adults, and it is more common in men than in women. Plasmacytoma of the larynx usually presents with hoarseness, and it can also cause pain, dysphagia, and stridor.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare, benign neoplasm of mesenchymal origin. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and it is more common in males than in females. IMT can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the lungs, abdomen, and retroperitoneum. IMT usually presents with pain, mass, and fever.

In the case of the 45-year-old woman with recurrent vocal fold mass, the most likely diagnosis is IMT. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient's history of hoarseness and a vocal fold mass
* The patient's age and gender
* The location of the mass (vocal fold)
* The appearance of the mass (hemorrhagic-appearing polyp)
* The results of the pathologic examination (spindle-shaped cells with variable atypia, inflammatory cells, myxomatous and focally fibrous stroma, negative for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin, positive for vimentin and ALK1)

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Spindle cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm, and the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Laryngeal granuloma is a benign inflammatory lesion, and the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Plasmacytoma of the larynx is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells, and the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old woman with recurrent vocal fold mass is IMT.

A lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells. It is usually soft and movable, and it does not typically infiltrate surrounding tissues. The patient's mass was firm and irregular, and it infiltrated the paraspinal musculature. These findings are not consistent with a lipoma.

A rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. It is usually rapidly growing and aggressive. The patient's mass was slow-growing and relatively avascular. These findings are not consistent with a rhabdomyosarcoma.

An infantile hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is usually small and superficial, and it often resolves spontaneously. The patient's mass was large and deep, and it did not resolve. These findings are not consistent with an infantile hemangioma.

Glial heterotopia is a congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of clusters of glial cells in the wrong location in the brain. It is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological problems. The patient's mass was located in the posterior neck, which is consistent with the location of glial heterotopias. The patient also had cerebellar hypoplasia, which is a known association with glial heterotopias. The patient's mass was also histologically consistent with glial heterotopia, as it showed positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is D. Glial heterotopia.

 29%|██▉       | 440/1525 [1:48:28<4:38:43, 15.41s/it]The correct answer is B. Cerebral vein thrombosis.

A carotid artery dissection is a tear in the wall of the carotid artery, which is a major artery that supplies blood to the brain. This can cause stroke, brain hemorrhage, and other serious complications. However, carotid artery dissection is not typically associated with dysphagia or dysphonia.

Posttraumatic central motor impairment is a condition that can occur after a head injury. It is characterized by weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the body. This can cause dysphagia and dysphonia, but it is not typically the only symptom.

Postoperative laryngeal paralysis is a rare complication of surgery that can occur when the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged. This nerve controls the movement of the vocal cords. When it is damaged, the vocal cords can become paralyzed, which can cause dysphagia and dysphonia.

In this case, the patient's history of epilepsy and alcohol use disorder puts her at an increased risk for cerebral vein thrombosis. Cerebral vein thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot forms in one or more of the veins that drain blood from the brain. This can lead to a stroke, brain hemorrhage, and other serious complications.

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and dysphonia are consistent with cerebral vein thrombosis. The CT scan with contrast shows a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which is a major vein that drains blood from the brain. This thrombosis is likely causing acute compression of the recurrent nerve as it follows the course of the cranial accessory nerve then the vagus nerve. This compression is likely causing the patient's dysphagia and dysphonia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cerebral vein thrombosis.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder of lymph nodes and subcutaneous tissues. It is characterized by lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and angioedema. The disease is most common in men of Asian descent, but it can occur in people of all races and ethnicities.

The exact cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, accumulate in the lymph nodes and subcutaneous tissues, causing swelling and fibrosis.

The symptoms of Kimura disease vary from person to person. The most common symptom is a painless, enlarging mass in the neck, armpit, or groin. Other symptoms may include fever, fatigue, night sweats, and joint pain.

There is no cure for Kimura disease, but the symptoms can be treated with medication. Corticosteroids are often used to reduce inflammation and swelling. Other medications, such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, may also be used.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected lymph nodes. However, surgery is not always effective, and the disease may recur.

The prognosis for people with Kimura disease is generally good. The disease is usually slow-growing and does not usually lead to serious complications. However, in some cases, the disease can be life-threatening.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation.

* Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal lymphocytes. The patient's presentation does not suggest Hodgkin lymphoma.

The patient has a history of relapsing optic neuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, which is consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. A whole-body PET scan is a sensitive test for detecting the presence of multiple sclerosis lesions, and it can be used to monitor the disease over time. In this case, the patient has had multiple relapses of her symptoms, and it is important to determine whether the disease is active or not. A whole-body PET scan can help to answer this question.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Administer high-dose corticosteroids) is incorrect because the patient has already been treated with corticosteroids in the past, and they have not been effective in preventing her relapses.
* Option B (Repeat the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) is incorrect because the patient's previous MRI scan was normal. A repeat MRI scan is unlikely to show any new findings.
* Option D (Repeat the testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum and cerebrospinal fluid) is incorrect because the patient's previous testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme was normal. Repeating this test is unlikely to be helpful.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Repeat the whole-body positron emission tomography scan. This test can help to determine whether the patient's disease is active or not, and it can be used to monitor the disease over time.

A dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure to create a new drainage pathway for tears from the lacrimal sac to the nasal cavity. It is typically performed for patients with chronic dacryocystitis, which is inflammation of the lacrimal sac. However, DCR is not indicated for the patient in this case because she does not have dacryocystitis.

A canaliculotomy is a surgical procedure to open a blocked tear duct. It is typically performed for patients with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction, which is a blockage of the nasolacrimal duct that is present at birth. However, canaliculotomy is not indicated for the patient in this case because she does not have a blocked tear duct.

Systemic steroids are a type of medication that can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation. However, systemic steroids are not typically used to treat chronic conjunctivitis. In fact, systemic steroids can actually worsen chronic conjunctivitis in some cases.

Sweeping the superior fornix is a procedure that is performed to remove foreign material from the superior conjunctival fornix. It is typically performed for patients with foreign bodies in the eye. However, sweeping the superior fornix can also be used to remove mucus and debris from the eye. In the case of the patient in this case, sweeping the superior fornix is the correct treatment because she has a pseudomembrane of the tarsal conjunctiva. The pseudomembrane is likely composed of mucus and debris, and sweeping the superior fornix will help to remove it.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Sweep the superior fornix.

The patient presented with a black-pigmented eyelid nodule that was 8 × 6 × 4 mm in size and had associated madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia. These findings are concerning for a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur on any part of the body, including the eyelids. It is the most serious type of skin cancer, and it is important to diagnose and treat it early.

The first step in the treatment of a malignant melanoma is to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. If the biopsy shows that the lesion is malignant, the next step is to remove the lesion with a margin of healthy tissue. This is called a full-thickness eyelid resection. The margins of the resection are carefully controlled intraoperatively to ensure that all of the cancerous tissue is removed.

After the lesion is removed, the patient may need to undergo additional treatment, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer and prevent it from spreading.

The other options are incorrect because they are not appropriate treatments for a malignant melanoma.

* Option A, treating with hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment, is not appropriate because it would not treat the underlying malignancy.
* Option B, performing an incision and drainage, is not appropriate because it would not remove the entire lesion.
* Option C, providing a corticosteroid injection, is not appropriate because it would not treat the underlying malignancy.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins.

 29%|██▉       | 445/1525 [1:49:40<4:21:31, 14.53s/it]The correct answer is C. Initiate vitamin C supplementation. The patient has a history of psychosis and recurrent venous thromboembolism. He is currently experiencing fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. On examination, he has peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura. Laboratory test results show a normocytic anemia, normal platelet count, and a mild leukopenia. Folic acid level is low and vitamin B12 level is normal. Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase are all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head are negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram reveals no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs shows no thromboembolism.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the synthesis of collagen, carnitine, and norepinephrine. It is also a cofactor for several enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Vitamin C deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, arthralgias, petechiae, ecchymosis, and purpura. In severe cases, vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy, a condition characterized by bleeding gums, poor wound healing, and anemia.

The initial treatment for vitamin C deficiency is to administer oral vitamin C supplements. The recommended daily intake of vitamin C for adults is 90 milligrams. However, patients with vitamin C deficiency may need to take higher doses, up to 1,000 milligrams per day. Vitamin C supplements should be taken with food to improve absorption.

Patients with vitamin C deficiency should also be advised to eat a diet that is rich in vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, and broccoli. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, so it is not stored in the body. Therefore, it is important to consume vitamin C-rich foods on a regular basis.

In the case of the patient described above, the correct treatment is to initiate vitamin C supplementation. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, arthralgias, petechiae, ecchymosis, and purpura. In severe cases, vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy.

Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, so it is not stored in the body. Therefore, it is important to consume vitamin C-rich foods on a regular basis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Order a bone marrow biopsy is incorrect because the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of a hematologic disorder. A bone marrow biopsy is not necessary to diagnose vitamin C deficiency.
* Option B: Administer prothrombin complex concentrate is incorrect because the patient does not have a bleeding disorder. Prothrombin complex concentrate is a blood product that is used to treat bleeding disorders. It is not necessary to administer prothrombin complex concentrate to a patient with vitamin C deficiency.
* Option D: Order additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay) is incorrect because the patient's prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are normal. There is no need to order additional coagulation tests.

 29%|██▉       | 446/1525 [1:49:56<4:29:13, 14.97s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.

The patient's current INR is 3.7, which is above the target range of 2.0 to 3.0. The patient has reported no extra warfarin doses, medication changes, dietary nonadherence, or bleeding. His warfarin dosage has been stable for the past year.

There are several possible reasons for the patient's elevated INR. One possibility is that the patient is not taking his warfarin as prescribed. Another possibility is that the patient is taking other medications that interact with warfarin, such as antibiotics or anticonvulsants. It is also possible that the patient's diet is interfering with his warfarin absorption.

The best way to determine the cause of the patient's elevated INR is to perform a plasma INR test. A plasma INR test is more accurate than a POC INR test. It is also important to review the patient's medication list and dietary history.

If the patient's plasma INR test confirms that his INR is elevated, the next step will be to adjust his warfarin dosage. The dosage adjustment will depend on the cause of the elevated INR. If the patient is not taking his warfarin as prescribed, the dosage will need to be increased. If the patient is taking other medications that interact with warfarin, the dosage of those medications may need to be adjusted. If the patient's diet is interfering with his warfarin absorption, the patient's diet may need to be modified.

It is important to monitor the patient's INR closely after the dosage adjustment. The INR should be checked again in 1 to 2 weeks. If the INR is still elevated, the dosage may need to be adjusted again.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan.

A. Continue current warfarin dosing and perform a point-of-care (POC) international normalized ratio (INR) test in 1 week. This option does not address the possibility that the patient is not taking his warfarin as prescribed or that he is taking other medications that interact with warfarin.

B. Skip 2 doses of warfarin then resume current dosage and perform a POC INR test in 2 weeks. This option does not address the possibility that the patient's diet is interfering with his warfarin absorption.

C. Skip 2 doses of warfarin, reduce weekly dosage by 10%, and perform a POC INR in 2 weeks. This option is too aggressive. The dosage adjustment is too large and it is not clear why the patient's INR is elevated.

The patient is a 30-year-old man with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). He presented to the emergency department with palpitations and tachycardia. His symptoms began 1 day ago and have been worsening. His past medical history is significant for SVT, which was treated with adenosine 1 year ago. His physical examination is notable for an erythematous oropharynx, tonsillar exudates, a tachycardic, regular heart rhythm, and clear lungs. His ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with SVT. SVT is a common arrhythmia that can occur in people of all ages. It is caused by a re-entry circuit in the heart that can lead to a rapid heart rate. The most common symptoms of SVT are palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

There are several treatment options for SVT. The first-line treatment is usually adenosine, which is a medication that can terminate the arrhythmia. If adenosine is not effective, other medications such as verapamil or diltiazem can be used. In some cases, cardioversion (electric shock) may be necessary to terminate the arrhythmia.

In this case, the patient has been treated with adenosine and direct current cardioversion, but the arrhythmia has not been terminated. The patient is also febrile, which suggests that he may have an infection. Infections can cause SVT, and they can also make it more difficult to treat.

In this case, the best course of action is to stop the diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to treat SVT. It is more effective than diltiazem in terminating SVT, and it is also less likely to cause hypotension.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous amiodarone. Amiodarone is a medication that can be used to treat SVT, but it is not the first-line treatment. It is also more likely to cause side effects than verapamil.
* Option B: Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J. Cardioversion can be used to terminate SVT, but it is not the first-line treatment. It is also more likely to cause side effects than medications such as verapamil.
* Option C: Switch to intravenous esmolol drip. Esmolol is a medication that can be used to treat SVT, but it is not the first-line treatment. It is also more likely to cause side effects than verapamil.

PXE is a rare, inherited disorder of connective tissue characterized by the accumulation of abnormal elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene, which encodes a protein that transports cholesterol and other lipids out of cells. The accumulation of abnormal elastic fibers leads to the characteristic skin lesions of PXE, which are yellowish papules or plaques that typically occur around the umbilicus (navel). The skin lesions of PXE are usually asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic (itchy). In some cases, PXE can also cause complications in the eyes, such as retinal detachment, and in the cardiovascular system, such as aneurysms and dissections.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis is a rare, acquired disorder of connective tissue that is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal elastic fibers in the papillary dermis.

A. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It is typically diagnosed in children, but can occur in adults as well. The most common presentation is a skin rash, but other symptoms may include bone pain, lymphadenopathy, and liver or spleen enlargement. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected skin. Treatment depends on the extent of the disease, but may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

B. Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. It is the most common type of primary cutaneous lymphoma, accounting for about 80% of cases. It is typically diagnosed in adults over the age of 50, and is more common in men than women. The most common presentation is a single, red, scaly patch on the skin. The lesion may grow over time, and may become ulcerated or bleed. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected skin. Treatment depends on the extent of the disease, but may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

C. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that is caused by a virus called Merkel cell polyomavirus. It is typically diagnosed in adults over the age of 70, and is more common in men than women. The most common presentation is a small, raised, red or purple bump on the skin. The lesion may grow over time, and may become ulcerated or bleed. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected skin. Treatment depends on the stage of the disease, but may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

D. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that arises from blood vessels. It is typically diagnosed in adults over the age of 60, and is more common in men than women. The most common presentation is a red, purple, or blue bruise-like lesion on the skin. The lesion may grow over time, and may become ulcerated or bleed. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected skin. Treatment depends on the stage of the disease, but may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her early 80s who presented with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic, enlarging, partly infiltrated erythematous cutaneous patch localized to the periareolar area of her left breast. She had no history of cancer or chronic diseases. No cutaneous nodules were present. Physical examination did not show adenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, or other remarkable findings. Peripheral blood test results were within normal limits. Tests for tumor markers including cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, and CA 125 were unremarkable. No palpable breast masses were identifiable. Breast ultrasonography and mammography did not reveal parenchymal nodules. A local steroid therapy was administered, with no benefit. A biopsy of the skin lesion was performed.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsy showed a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement. The cells were large and atypical, with scanty cytoplasm. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type.

There is no cure for HDL2, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms.

The patient in the case presented with involuntary orofaciolingual movements, dysphagia, dysarthria, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. He also had mild cognitive decline, a gait disturbance, and a positive family history of chorea. The laboratory examination results revealed elevated CK levels, slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels, and the presence of acanthocytes in the blood smear. The electrophysiological examination results revealed reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential of bilateral median and ulnar nerves. Electromyogram results showed neurogenic damage in lower limb muscles. The cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results revealed a marked bilateral caudate head atrophy.

The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of chorea-acanthocytosis. Chorea-acanthocytosis is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the presence of chorea, acanthocytes in the blood, and neurological abnormalities. The symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood and include involuntary movements of the face, arms, and legs. Acanthocytes are abnormal red blood cells that have a spiny appearance.

Screening for thrombophilia is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of a hypercoagulable state. Prolonged Holter monitoring is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia that could have caused the stroke. Taking serial blood cultures is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of infection.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Transthoracic echocardiogram: A transthoracic echocardiogram is a safe and non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It can be used to assess the structure and function of the heart, as well as to detect blood clots, abnormal heart valves, and other potential causes of stroke. In this patient, a transthoracic echocardiogram would be the most appropriate test to confirm the suspicion of left ventricular lead placement and to assess for other potential causes of the stroke.
* B. Screen for thrombophilia: Thrombophilia is a condition that increases the risk of blood clots. It can be caused by a number of factors, including inherited genetic mutations, certain medications, and certain medical conditions. In this patient, there is no evidence of a hypercoagulable state, so screening for thrombophilia is not indicated.
* C. Prolonged Holter monitoring: Holter monitoring is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart for a period of 24 hours or longer. It can be used to detect arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke. In this patient, there is no evidence of atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia, so prolonged Holter monitoring is not indicated.
* D. Take serial blood cultures: Blood cultures are tests that are used to detect bacteria in the blood. They are typically used to diagnose infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis. In this patient, there is no evidence of infection, so taking serial blood cultures is not indicated.

The patient's history of vomiting and emaciation in her early 40s, as well as her family history of liver cancer, raises the possibility of a systemic disorder such as Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder that causes copper to build up in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms including liver disease, neurological problems, and psychiatric problems. One of the characteristic features of Wilson's disease is the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are brown or green rings that form around the cornea of the eye.

The patient's bilateral vitreous opacity without cells is also consistent with Wilson's disease. Vitreous opacity is a common finding in Wilson's disease, and it is thought to be caused by the deposition of copper in the vitreous humor.

The patient's mild anemia is not a specific finding in Wilson's disease, but it is a common finding in patients with liver disease.

The patient's normal liver and renal functions do not exclude the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Liver and renal function can be normal in early stages of Wilson's disease.

The patient's negative electrocardiogram is also not a specific finding in Wilson's disease. Electrocardiogram abnormalities are not typically seen in Wilson's disease.

The patient's bilateral vitreous opacity without cells, her history of vomiting and emaciation in her early 40s, her family history of liver cancer, and her mild anemia all suggest the possibility of Wilson's disease. The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) plus pathological examination plus genetic test. PPV will allow for the removal of vitreous material that can be examined pathologically for evidence of copper deposition. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical test is not the correct answer because it is not a sensitive or specific test for Wilson's disease. Aqueous humor biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the removal of a small sample of fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye. The fluid is then analyzed for the presence of copper. However, aqueous humor copper levels can be normal in patients with Wilson's disease, and the test is not specific for Wilson's disease.

Abdominal ultrasonography is not the correct answer because it is not a sensitive or specific test for Wilson's disease. Abdominal ultrasonography is a non-invasive procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the abdomen. The test can be used to look for evidence of liver disease, but it is not a sensitive or specific test for Wilson's disease.

Follow-up is not the correct answer because it does not provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment for the patient's condition. Follow-up is important for monitoring the patient's condition and for providing supportive care, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

 30%|██▉       | 453/1525 [1:51:45<4:32:42, 15.26s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain orbital imaging.

The patient has a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation, which was not present on previous examinations. This finding is concerning for a choroidal melanoma, which is a type of eye cancer that can spread to the orbit. Orbital imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

Fluorescein angiography is a test that can be used to visualize blood vessels in the eye. However, it is not helpful in diagnosing choroidal melanoma. A liver biopsy is a test that can be used to diagnose liver cancer. However, there is no evidence that the patient has liver cancer. Monitoring the patient with follow-up in 6 months is not appropriate, as the patient has a new and concerning finding that requires further investigation.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Obtain orbital imaging.
It is reasoning
 30%|██▉       | 454/1525 [1:51:59<4:27:12, 14.97s/it]The correct answer is A. Investigate for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis; if negative, start treatment with steroids.

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with blurry vision in her right eye for a duration of 2 weeks. Her visual acuity with correction is 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Her intraocular pressures are 14 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination of the right eye is notable for an amelanotic choroidal mass with overlying subretinal fluid. Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye are unremarkable. Results of fluorescein angiographic imaging of the right eye showed late leakage corresponding to the choroidal mass; the left eye was unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated a choroidal mass with an irregular surface contour and a mild overlying vitreous cell. On B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye, a superotemporal choroidal mass with an irregular surface contour and medium internal reflectivity was observed. On further questioning, the patient reported a 9 pack-year smoking history. She had no known history of malignant conditions. She denied recent fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, and travel to foreign countries, and she was otherwise feeling well.

The differential diagnosis for an amelanotic choroidal mass includes:

* Melanoma
* Non-melanoma choroidal tumors
* Sarcoidosis
* Tuberculosis
* Other inflammatory conditions
* Metastatic disease

The most common cause of an amelanotic choroidal mass is melanoma. However, in this patient, there are several features that make melanoma less likely, including her age (melanoma is more common in patients over the age of 60), her lack of risk factors for melanoma (no family history, no history of sunburn, no history of atypical nevi), and the fact that the mass is amelanotic (melanoma is more likely to be pigmented).

Sarcoidosis is another possibility in this patient. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs, eyes, skin, joints, and other organs. It is more common in African Americans and people of Scandinavian descent. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for sarcoidosis typically involves corticosteroids.

Tuberculosis is another possibility in this patient. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and other organs. It is more common in people who live in or have traveled to areas with high rates of tuberculosis. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for tuberculosis typically involves antibiotics.

The most important next step in the management of this patient is to investigate for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. This can be done with a chest X-ray, blood tests, and imaging studies of the lungs and eyes. If sarcoidosis or tuberculosis is diagnosed, the patient will be treated with corticosteroids or antibiotics, respectively. If sarcoidosis or tuberculosis is not diagnosed, the patient may need to be referred to a specialist for further evaluation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Treat the mass with radiotherapy: Radiotherapy is not the first-line treatment for an amelanotic choroidal mass. It is typically reserved for patients with metastatic disease or who have failed other treatments.
* C. Refer the patient to a primary care physician for a metastatic workup: A metastatic workup is not necessary in this patient because there is no evidence of metastatic disease.
* D. Proceed with pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy: Pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy is a surgical procedure that is used to diagnose and treat certain eye conditions. It is not necessary in this patient because the diagnosis can be made with clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

 30%|██▉       | 455/1525 [1:52:14<4:30:10, 15.15s/it]The correct answer is B. Subungual squamous cell carcinoma.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail. It is the most common nail disorder, affecting about 10% of the population. The most common symptoms are a white or yellow discoloration of the nail, thickening of the nail, and crumbling of the nail. Onychomycosis is usually treated with antifungal medications.

Subungual verruca vulgaris is a wart that occurs under the nail. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The most common symptom is a small, raised bump under the nail. Subungual verruca vulgaris is usually treated with cryotherapy, laser therapy, or topical medications.

Subungual exostosis is a benign growth that occurs on the bone under the nail. It is caused by repeated trauma to the nail bed. The most common symptom is a hard, bony lump under the nail. Subungual exostosis is usually treated with surgery.

In this case, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a 7-year history of a painful subungual mass of the right thumb. The lesion was initially believed to be an infection; however, results of both mycological and bacteriologic examinations were unremarkable. The patient had no notable medical history, including dyskeratosis congenita, trauma, sun exposure, radiation exposure, chemical exposure to tar or arsenic or exposure to minerals, chronic immunosuppression, or chronic infection. Physical examination revealed a subungual nodule with some exudation and crusts. The distal nail plate had been destroyed and showed onycholysis with obvious separation from the nail bed. Pertinent laboratory results (complete blood cell count, liver panel, kidney panel) were within normal limits. Lesional biopsy was also performed, which showed proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis. These findings are consistent with subungual squamous cell carcinoma.

Subungual squamous cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that occurs under the nail. It is most common in people over the age of 50. The most common symptom is a painful, red, or black spot under the nail. Other symptoms may include bleeding, oozing, and nail loss. Subungual squamous cell carcinoma is usually treated with surgery.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail, and it is not associated with pain, redness, or bleeding. Subungual verruca vulgaris is a wart that occurs under the nail, and it is not associated with pain, redness, or bleeding. Subungual exostosis is a benign growth that occurs on the bone under the nail, and it is not associated with pain, redness, or bleeding.

 30%|██▉       | 456/1525 [1:52:27<4:16:24, 14.39s/it]The correct answer is D. Test for serum cryoglobulin level.

The patient's purpura is most likely due to cryoglobulinemia, a condition in which immunoglobulins precipitate in the cold. This can cause microvascular damage and purpura, particularly in the extremities. Cryoglobulinemia is often associated with other conditions, such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and hepatitis C infection.

The patient's history of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma makes cryoglobulinemia a particularly likely diagnosis. In addition, her purpura is widespread and painful, which are features of cryoglobulinemia.

The other answer choices are not as likely in this patient. Empirical intravenous antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of infection. Protein C concentrate is used to treat disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is not a likely diagnosis in this patient. A calcium-phosphate product is used to calculate the risk of kidney stones, which is not a likely concern in this patient.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to test for serum cryoglobulin level. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.
It is reasoning
 30%|██▉       | 457/1525 [1:52:39<4:01:44, 13.58s/it]The correct answer is A. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

The patient is a man in his 50s with a history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities. He has been treated with prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and adalimumab without improvement. Pulmonary function testing reveals mild restrictive disease with decreased forced vital capacity and total lung capacity. Results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel; hemoglobin A1c; viral and rheumatologic panels, including HIV blood tests; chest radiograph; high-resolution chest computed tomographic scan; echocardiography; endoscopic studies; hand radiographs; and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal or otherwise unremarkable. The results of lesional skin biopsies obtained from multiple involved sites initially revealed nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis before a diagnostic biopsy was performed.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal T cells in the skin. The most common type of CTCL is mycosis fungoides, which typically presents with patches or plaques of skin that are red, scaly, and sometimes itchy. Other types of CTCL include Sezary syndrome, which is characterized by a generalized erythroderma (redness of the skin) and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which is characterized by large, atypical cells in the skin.

The patient's history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion is also consistent with CTCL. CTCL can involve other organs in addition to the skin, including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. The patient's pulmonary function testing results are consistent with mild restrictive lung disease, which is a common finding in patients with CTCL.

The patient's laboratory tests are all normal or otherwise unremarkable. This is consistent with the fact that CTCL is typically a relatively indolent (slow-growing) lymphoma. The patient's skin biopsies initially revealed nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis, which is a non-specific inflammatory reaction that can be seen in a variety of skin disorders. However, a subsequent diagnostic biopsy revealed a nodular to diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with admixed atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes and numerous histiocytes. This finding is consistent with CTCL.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical presentation, history, laboratory tests, and biopsy findings are all consistent with CTCL. The correct answer to the question is A. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition characterized by the formation of ring-shaped lesions. It is not associated with systemic symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, or lymphadenopathy.
* Small-vessel vasculitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, but it is not associated with systemic symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, or lymphadenopathy.
* Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, skin, eyes, and lymph nodes. It is not associated with polyarticular inflammatory arthritis.

Nevus comedonicus is a rare, congenital skin condition characterized by groups of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) that are present at birth or appear shortly thereafter. The lesions are usually located on the face, trunk, or extremities, and they may be single or multiple. Nevi comedonici are often asymptomatic, but they may become inflamed or infected. Treatment options include topical retinoids, laser therapy, and surgical excision.

Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by small, punctate, keratotic papules on the palms and soles. The lesions are usually present at birth or appear in early childhood. They are caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein keratin 17, which is involved in the formation of the skin barrier. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is usually asymptomatic, but the lesions may become inflamed or infected. Treatment options include topical retinoids, laser therapy, and surgical excision.

Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma is a rare, genetic skin condition characterized by small, punctate, keratotic papules on the palms and soles. The lesions are usually present at birth or appear in early childhood. They are caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein keratin 16, which is involved in the formation of the skin barrier. Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma is usually asymptomatic, but the lesions may become inflamed or infected. Treatment options include topical retinoids, laser therapy, and surgical excision.

Familial comedonal Darier disease is a rare, genetic skin condition characterized by comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and papules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are usually present at birth or appear in early childhood. They are caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein ATP2A2, which is involved in the production of energy. Familial comedonal Darier disease is usually asymptomatic, but the lesions may become inflamed or infected. Treatment options include topical retinoids, laser therapy, and surgical excision.

In the case presented, the patient is a girl in her teens who presented with asymptomatic, punctate, keratotic papules localized to the right palm and right third proximal finger that had been present since age 2 years. Prior treatments included cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, and 40% salicylic acid, with partial improvement reported but never complete clearance. Medical history and family history were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed grouped and circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core. A 4-mm punch biopsy from a papule on the palm was performed. The histopathologic findings showed dilated follicular infundibula with keratinous core and absent hair shaft. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of nevus comedonicus.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is characterized by small, punctate, keratotic papules on the palms and soles. Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma is characterized by small, punctate, keratotic papules on the palms and soles.

 30%|███       | 459/1525 [1:53:11<4:25:56, 14.97s/it]The correct diagnosis is Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). This is a rare, chronic, multisystem disorder characterized by the accumulation of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in the reticuloendothelial system. The most common clinical manifestations are bone lesions, organomegaly, and skin involvement. ECD can affect any organ system, but the most commonly involved are the bones, lungs, heart, and skin.

The patient in the case presented with progressive neurological impairment and an enhancing brainstem lesion. The MRI findings are consistent with ECD, as they show a lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass in the brainstem and dural enhancement. The cerebrospinal fluid findings are also consistent with ECD, as they show normal results twice, including for white blood cell count with a differential, glucose level, total protein level, IgG index, oligoclonal bands, cultures, and cytology testing.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown cause that can affect any organ system. The most common clinical manifestations are pulmonary involvement, skin lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Sarcoidosis can affect the central nervous system (CNS), but this is uncommon. When it does occur, the most common manifestations are cranial neuropathies, seizures, and meningitis. The MRI findings in sarcoidosis are not specific, and the cerebrospinal fluid findings are often normal.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the proliferation of large B cells. DLBCL can affect any organ system, but the most commonly involved are the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. DLBCL can rarely affect the CNS, but this is uncommon. When it does occur, the most common manifestations are headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The MRI findings in DLBCL can be variable, but they often show multiple, large, contrast-enhancing lesions in the brain. The cerebrospinal fluid findings in DLBCL are often abnormal, and they may show elevated levels of white blood cells, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS that is thought to be an autoimmune reaction. ADEM can occur after a viral infection, vaccination, or other triggering event. The most common clinical manifestations are fever, headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The MRI findings in ADEM often show multiple, small, contrast-enhancing lesions in the brain. The cerebrospinal fluid findings in ADEM are often abnormal, and they may show elevated levels of white blood cells, protein, and oligoclonal bands.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis in this case is Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's clinical presentation, MRI findings, and cerebrospinal fluid findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient has high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, which is a condition in which the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm are disrupted. This can cause a number of symptoms, including syncope (fainting), shortness of breath, and chest pain.

Ticagrelor is a medication that is used to prevent blood clots. It is often prescribed after a heart attack or stroke. However, ticagrelor can also cause AV block. In this case, it is likely that the patient's AV block is being caused by ticagrelor.

Clopidogrel is another medication that is used to prevent blood clots. It is similar to ticagrelor, but it does not cause AV block. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to switch from ticagrelor to clopidogrel.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Implanting a permanent pacemaker is not necessary in this case, as the patient's AV block is likely to resolve once ticagrelor is discontinued. Discontinuation of metoprolol tartrate is also not necessary, as this medication is not likely to be causing the patient's AV block. Administering oral theophylline is also not necessary, as this medication is not used to treat AV block.

The patient in the case has a number of features consistent with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, including facial dysmorphism, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis. Ectopic thymus is a common finding in patients with this syndrome, occurring in up to 50% of cases.

The patient's neck mass is consistent with an ectopic thymus. The mass is located in the neck, which is the most common location for an ectopic thymus. The mass is also soft and palpable, which are also characteristic features of an ectopic thymus.

The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with an ectopic thymus. The MRI shows a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces. This is a typical location for an ectopic thymus. The mass is also mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, which is another characteristic feature of an ectopic thymus.

The patient's biopsy results are also consistent with an ectopic thymus. The biopsy shows a polymorphic population of lymphocytes, fibroadipose tissue, and a concentric island of squamous cells with central keratinization. This is a typical finding in an ectopic thymus.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign tumor of adipose tissue. It is the most common type of soft tissue tumor. Lipomas are typically located in the subcutaneous tissue, but they can also occur in other areas of the body, including the neck. Lipomas are usually soft, rubbery, and non-tender. They are often solitary, but they can also occur in multiple locations. The MRI findings in this case are not consistent with a lipoma.
* B. Branchial cleft cyst: A branchial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly that results from incomplete closure of one of the branchial arches during embryogenesis. Branchial cleft cysts are typically located in the neck, but they can also occur in the head and chest. They are usually lined with squamous epithelium and may contain mucus or keratin. Branchial cleft cysts are usually asymptomatic, but they can become infected or cause obstruction of the airway or esophagus. The MRI findings in this case are not consistent with a branchial cleft cyst.
* D. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Rhabdomyosarcomas can occur in any part of the body, but they are most common in the head and neck, extremities, and genitourinary tract. Rhabdomyosarcomas are typically fast-growing tumors that can metastasize to other parts of the body. The MRI findings in this case are not consistent with a rhabdomyosarcoma.

The patient has bilateral retinal detachments, which are a serious condition that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. The most common cause of retinal detachment is age-related macular degeneration, but it can also be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation. In this case, the patient has a history of fever, chills, and coughing, which suggests that she may have an infection. The most common infectious causes of retinal detachment are tuberculosis and syphilis.

Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests are blood tests that can be used to screen for tuberculosis and syphilis, respectively. Chest radiography can be used to look for evidence of active tuberculosis. If the patient is found to have an infection, she will need to be treated with antibiotics.

Intravitreal triamcinolone is a corticosteroid that can be injected into the eye to treat retinal detachment. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Intravitreal triamcinolone is more commonly used to treat uveitis, which is an inflammation of the uveal tract, the middle layer of the eye.

Human leukocyte antigen genotyping is a test that can be used to determine a person's risk of developing certain diseases. However, it is not a useful test in this case. The patient's history and physical examination suggest that she has an infection, and she does not have any risk factors for other diseases that could cause retinal detachment.

A pars plana vitrectomy with a chorioretinal biopsy is a surgical procedure that can be used to treat retinal detachment. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. A pars plana vitrectomy is more commonly used to treat retinal detachment that is caused by trauma or inflammation.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography. These tests will help to determine the cause of the patient's retinal detachment and will allow her to be treated appropriately.

The patient in this case has bilateral limbus-sparing conjunctivitis, an erythematous chest rash, lip blistering, and worsening sore throat. He is also febrile and has pneumonia. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a serious, life-threatening skin condition that is characterized by the sudden onset of a rash, fever, and mucous membrane lesions. The rash typically starts on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. The mucous membrane lesions can occur in the mouth, eyes, nose, and genitals. SJS is usually caused by an allergic reaction to a medication. In this case, the patient's rash and conjunctivitis are likely due to his recent treatment with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

The treatment for SJS is supportive. This includes measures to control the fever, prevent dehydration, and protect the skin from infection. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation. The patient in this case should be started on a course of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids. The antibiotics will help to prevent infection of the eye, and the corticosteroids will help to reduce inflammation. The patient should also be instructed to avoid scratching his eyes, as this can worsen the conjunctivitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Recommend systemic corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for the treatment of SJS. Corticosteroids can worsen the condition by suppressing the immune system.
* C. Perform amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation is not a standard treatment for SJS. There is no evidence that this procedure is effective in treating the condition.
* D. Discontinue antibiotics and avoid all medications associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome: The patient should not discontinue his antibiotics without consulting his doctor. Stopping the antibiotics could worsen his pneumonia. The patient should also avoid all medications that he has been allergic to in the past.

 30%|███       | 464/1525 [1:54:27<4:29:56, 15.27s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history.

The patient has bilateral macular lesions, which are areas of damage to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. The macula is very sensitive to light, so any damage to it can cause significant visual impairment.

There are many possible causes of macular lesions, including age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, and macular degeneration. In order to determine the cause of the patient's lesions, it is important to obtain a thorough medical and personal history, including drug history. This will help the doctor to identify any possible risk factors for the patient's condition.

For example, age-related macular degeneration is a common condition that affects people over the age of 50. It is caused by the breakdown of the macula, which can be caused by a number of factors, including age, smoking, and family history. Macular edema is a condition that occurs when fluid builds up in the macula. It can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and inflammation. Macular degeneration is a condition that occurs when the cells in the macula die. It can be caused by a number of factors, including age, smoking, and family history.

Once the doctor has a thorough understanding of the patient's medical and personal history, they will be able to order the appropriate tests to determine the cause of the patient's lesions. The doctor may also recommend treatment for the patient's condition.

The other possible answers are incorrect because they do not provide enough information to determine the cause of the patient's lesions.

A. Prescribe laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation is incorrect because it does not provide enough information to determine the cause of the patient's lesions. Intraocular inflammation can be caused by a number of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. The doctor would need to order additional tests to determine the cause of the patient's inflammation.

B. Perform dye angiography is incorrect because it does not provide enough information to determine the cause of the patient's lesions. Dye angiography is a test that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It can be used to diagnose a number of conditions, including macular edema and macular degeneration. However, it cannot be used to determine the cause of these conditions.

D. Treat patient with antiviral drugs is incorrect because it does not provide enough information to determine the cause of the patient's lesions. Antiviral drugs are used to treat viral infections. However, there are a number of viral infections that can cause macular lesions. The doctor would need to order additional tests to determine the cause of the patient's lesions before prescribing antiviral drugs.

 30%|███       | 465/1525 [1:54:41<4:22:30, 14.86s/it]The correct answer is B. Observation for the eye and MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head.

The patient is an 18-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history who was referred to ocular oncology from pediatric ophthalmology for an intraocular mass near the optic nerve. Her parents noticed the left eye turning out for the past year. On examination, she fixed and followed with her right eye but not with the left, with 5.0-diopter exophoria at near in the left eye. Penlight examination results showed left leukocoria. Intraocular pressure and motility were normal bilaterally. On subsequent examination under anesthesia, the left optic nerve was obscured by a whitish mass. While the optic nerve itself was obscured, a pigmented crescent could be seen surrounding it. Ultrasonography results demonstrated an elevated retinal mass overlying an excavated optic nerve head. A small focus of hyperechogenicity was noted at the optic nerve head, consistent with calcium. Fluorescein angiography results demonstrated staining of the central whitish mass, which was obscuring the underlying retinal vessels. On fluorescein angiography results, no vessels were seen within the central whitish mass itself.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina, and other less common tumors, such as optic nerve glioma and medulloepithelioma. Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children, and it is usually diagnosed in children under the age of 2. The most common presenting sign of retinoblastoma is leukocoria, or white pupil. Other signs and symptoms may include strabismus (eye misalignment), poor vision, and glaucoma.

The diagnosis of retinoblastoma is made with a thorough history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI. Treatment for retinoblastoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, treatment may include laser therapy, cryotherapy, or chemotherapy. In more advanced disease, enucleation (removal of the eye) may be necessary.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation is concerning for retinoblastoma. The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain an MRI of the brain and orbits to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and to rule out a pineal gland tumor. The patient should also be referred to a pediatric oncologist for further management.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor, followed by chemotherapy for the eye. This is an aggressive treatment approach that is not warranted in this patient at this time. The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for retinoblastoma, but the diagnosis has not been confirmed. Further imaging studies and a consultation with a pediatric oncologist are necessary before making a treatment decision.
* C. Careful examination of the skin and genetic testing of genes on chromosomes 9 and 16. This is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Retinoblastoma is a sporadic cancer, and it is not associated with any known genetic syndromes. Careful examination of the skin may be appropriate in patients with a family history of retinoblastoma or other genetic syndromes that are associated with retinoblastoma, such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Genetic testing is not indicated in this patient at this time.
* D. Enucleation. This is a surgical procedure that is used to remove the eye. It is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The diagnosis of retinoblastoma has not been confirmed, and the patient is not at immediate risk of losing the eye. Further imaging studies and a consultation with a pediatric oncologist are necessary before making a treatment decision.

Erosive osteoarthritis is incorrect because the patient's symptoms began 1 month after the initiation of nivolumab, which is a checkpoint inhibitor used to treat cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking the ability of cancer cells to evade the immune system. In some cases, checkpoint inhibitors can also cause the immune system to attack healthy cells, including the joints. This can lead to an inflammatory arthritis that is similar to rheumatoid arthritis.

Metastatic bone disease is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that she has metastatic cancer. Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from its original site to other parts of the body. The most common symptoms of metastatic bone disease are pain, swelling, and tenderness in the affected bones.

Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis is incorrect because the patient's blood tests were negative for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody. These are two antibodies that are commonly found in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is the correct diagnosis because the patient's symptoms began 1 month after the initiation of nivolumab, and she has no other evidence of cancer or other autoimmune diseases. The patient's physical examination and laboratory tests are consistent with an inflammatory arthritis. The patient's response to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and intra-articular steroids is also consistent with an inflammatory arthritis.

The patient's case illustrates the importance of considering the possibility of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis in patients who develop joint symptoms after starting treatment with nivolumab. Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is a rare but serious side effect of nivolumab. It is important to diagnose and treat nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis promptly to prevent permanent joint damage.

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome who presents with chronic joint pain and stiffness involving the shoulders, hips, and knees. He also has a history of occasional bruising around his eyes. His vital signs are normal. No joint tenderness, warmth, or fluid collections are present, and skin examination is normal. The presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae are noted. Laboratory evaluation reveals normal results for complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and levels of electrolytes, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. A spot urinalysis showed a protein level of 220 mg/dL (reference range, <26 mg/dL), and a 24-hour urine collection revealed 1.8 g of albumin (reference range, <229 mg/24 h). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulders and hips showed synovial and capsular thickening.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of rheumatologic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren syndrome. However, the presence of proteinuria suggests that the patient may have a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is a condition in which there is a monoclonal protein in the blood, but there are no signs or symptoms of disease. The monoclonal protein can be detected on serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay.

Order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay is the correct answer because these tests will help to confirm the diagnosis of MGUS. If the patient does have MGUS, he will need to be monitored for the development of multiple myeloma, a more serious condition in which there is a proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Order bone scan is incorrect because a bone scan is not necessary to diagnose MGUS.
* C. Start methotrexate is incorrect because methotrexate is a medication that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. MGUS is not an inflammatory condition, so methotrexate would not be effective.
* D. Perform temporal artery biopsy is incorrect because a temporal artery biopsy is used to diagnose temporal arteritis, a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the temporal arteries. Temporal arteritis is not a likely diagnosis in this patient, so a temporal artery biopsy is not necessary.

A laboratory-based HbA1c test is the preferred method for diagnosing diabetes. It is a blood test that measures the amount of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood. HbA1c is a protein that forms when glucose attaches to red blood cells. The higher the HbA1c level, the higher the average blood glucose level has been over the past 2-3 months.

A point-of-care (POC) HbA1c test is a less accurate test that can be performed in the doctor's office. It is not as accurate as a laboratory-based test, but it can be useful in cases where a rapid diagnosis is needed.

A laboratory-based glucose test is not the preferred method for diagnosing diabetes. It measures the amount of glucose in the blood at a single point in time. This can be useful in diagnosing acute hyperglycemia, but it is not as accurate as a HbA1c test for diagnosing diabetes.

Do not perform glycemic testing because it is not indicated for this patient. The patient is at risk for diabetes, but he does not have any symptoms of hyperglycemia. A HbA1c test is the preferred method for diagnosing diabetes in asymptomatic patients.

Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a benign skin condition that can mimic lymphoma. It is characterized by the presence of small, red, dome-shaped papules or nodules on the skin. The papules or nodules may be itchy, but they are usually not painful. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is most common in middle-aged and older adults. It is more common in women than in men. The cause of cutaneous pseudolymphoma is unknown. However, it is thought to be caused by a reaction of the immune system to a trigger such as a virus or bacteria.

Ichthyosis vulgaris is a common genetic skin disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin. The scales are typically most pronounced on the elbows, knees, lower back, and buttocks. Ichthyosis vulgaris is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the protein filaggrin. Filaggrin is important for the formation of the skin barrier. When filaggrin is mutated, the skin barrier is not formed properly, leading to dry, scaly skin.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by dry, itchy skin. The itchiness can be severe and can lead to scratching, which can further damage the skin. Atopic dermatitis is often associated with other allergic conditions such as asthma and hay fever. The cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Large plaque parapsoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by large, scaly patches on the skin. The patches are typically round or oval and are often found on the trunk, arms, and legs. Large plaque parapsoriasis is a benign condition, but it can sometimes progress to a more serious condition such as mycosis fungoides.

The patient in the case presentation presented with a 12-year history of itchy eruptions over the whole body. Multiple nodules appeared on the upper back 1 year previously and gradually increased in number and size. The patient was otherwise healthy and denied a family history of inherited ichthyosis or atopy. Physical examination revealed extensive, dry scaly patches on the trunk, arms, and legs. Several 0.5- to 1-cm, dome-shaped, red papules and nodules were found on the upper back. Mildly enlarged lymph nodes were observed on the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. Results of routine blood tests, biochemistry analyses, and peripheral blood flow cytometry tests were within normal limits. No atypical cells were found in the peripheral blood. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the nodules on the patient’s back. The biopsy specimen showed small to medium-sized atypical cells, and focal areas of epidermotropism. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the atypical cells were positive for CD4.

The clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides is a rare, chronic, T-cell lymphoma that typically affects middle-aged and older adults. The disease is characterized by the development of scaly, itchy patches on the skin. The patches can be anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk, arms, and legs. In some cases, the patches can progress to form nodules or tumors. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides is a slow-growing cancer, and most patients have a good prognosis. However, the disease can be fatal if it is not treated.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a benign skin condition that does not typically cause the widespread, scaly patches that the patient is experiencing. Ichthyosis vulgaris is a genetic skin condition that is characterized by dry, scaly skin. However, it does not typically cause the itchy nodules that the patient is experiencing. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by dry, itchy skin. However, it does not typically cause the widespread, scaly patches that the patient is experiencing. Large plaque parapsoriasis is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by large, scaly patches on the skin. However, it does not typically cause the itchy nodules that the patient is experiencing.

Annular atrophic lichen planus is a chronic skin condition characterized by flat, ring-shaped lesions. It is most common on the lower legs, but can also occur on the arms, trunk, and scalp. The lesions are typically 1-2 cm in diameter, and may be slightly raised or depressed. They are often white or gray in color, and may have a scale or crust on the surface.

The exact cause of annular atrophic lichen planus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. It is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis and lupus.

There is no cure for annular atrophic lichen planus, but treatment can help to reduce the symptoms. Topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are often used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. In severe cases, oral steroids may be necessary.

Erythema annulare centrifugum is a skin condition that causes ring-shaped lesions. The lesions are typically red, scaly, and raised. They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the trunk and extremities. The cause of erythema annulare centrifugum is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no cure for erythema annulare centrifugum, but treatment can help to relieve the symptoms. Topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are often used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. In severe cases, oral steroids may be necessary.

Porokeratosis is a rare skin condition that causes small, scaly patches on the skin. The patches are typically brown or black, and can occur anywhere on the body. The cause of porokeratosis is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic condition. There is no cure for porokeratosis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are often used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. In severe cases, oral steroids may be necessary.

Granuloma annulare is a skin condition that causes small, raised bumps on the skin. The bumps are typically pink or red, and can occur anywhere on the body. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no cure for granuloma annulare, but treatment can help to relieve the symptoms. Topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are often used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. In severe cases, oral steroids may be necessary.

In the case presented, the patient is a white woman in her 50s with a history of breast augmentation surgery. She developed asymptomatic, rough areas on her breasts several months postoperatively. The lesions are 1- to 2-cm slightly erythematous annular atrophic plaques with more involvement of the left breast than the right. The rims of the lesions are raised with slight white scale and the centers slightly depressed and wrinkled in appearance.

The clinical presentation is most consistent with annular atrophic lichen planus. Annular atrophic lichen planus is a chronic skin condition characterized by flat, ring-shaped lesions.

 31%|███       | 471/1525 [1:56:11<4:24:16, 15.04s/it]The correct answer is C. Glioma.

A postinfectious myelopathy is an inflammatory condition of the spinal cord that can occur following a viral or bacterial infection. It is characterized by progressive weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. The MRI findings in postinfectious myelopathy are typically non-specific, and the diagnosis is made based on the clinical history and laboratory findings. Treatment is supportive, and most patients recover within several months.

A toxic myelopathy is an inflammatory condition of the spinal cord that can be caused by a variety of toxins, including heavy metals, medications, and chemotherapy agents. It is characterized by progressive weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. The MRI findings in toxic myelopathy are typically non-specific, and the diagnosis is made based on the clinical history and laboratory findings. Treatment is supportive, and most patients recover within several months.

A glioma is a type of cancer that starts in the glial cells of the brain or spinal cord. Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, and they can also occur in the spinal cord. The most common symptom of a glioma is a progressive neurological deficit, such as weakness, numbness, or seizures. The MRI findings in a glioma are typically characteristic, and the diagnosis is made based on the clinical history, MRI findings, and biopsy. Treatment for a glioma depends on the type of glioma, the location of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

A spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) is a rare vascular anomaly that occurs when there is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein in the spinal dura mater. SDAVFs can cause progressive neurological deficits, such as weakness, numbness, and pain. The MRI findings in an SDAVF are typically characteristic, and the diagnosis is made based on the clinical history, MRI findings, and angiography. Treatment for an SDAVF may include surgery or endovascular therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a 48-year-old woman who presented with a 2-month history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. She had no history of recent infection or exposure to toxins. Her MRI showed a long-segment, expansile T2 hyperintense lesion spanning C5 through T12 and involving greater than two-thirds of the cord diameter. The spinal cord was mildly diffusely swollen without an appreciated focal mass. There was associated extensive ill-defined enhancement of the spinal cord spanning T3 through T9. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of glioma. The other possible diagnoses (postinfectious myelopathy, toxic myelopathy, and spinal dural arteriovenous fistula) are less likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and MRI findings.

The patient in this case has a number of findings that suggest possible right heart dysfunction, including exertional dyspnea, neck fullness, an enlarged, pulsatile liver, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities. However, transthoracic echocardiography is not as sensitive as right and left heart catheterization for detecting right heart dysfunction. Right and left heart catheterization can directly measure right and left ventricular pressures and pulmonary artery pressures, which can help to diagnose and assess the severity of right heart dysfunction.

Transesophageal echocardiography is a more sensitive test than transthoracic echocardiography for detecting valvular abnormalities, but it is not as sensitive as right and left heart catheterization for detecting right heart dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement can be used to assess the structure and function of the heart, but it is not as sensitive as right and left heart catheterization for detecting right heart dysfunction. Liver biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of liver tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. It can be used to diagnose a variety of liver diseases, but it is not useful for diagnosing right heart dysfunction.

Percutaneous biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose a breast mass. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a needle into the mass and removing a small sample of tissue for analysis. This can be done under local anesthesia, and the patient can usually go home the same day.

The other options are not as accurate or as safe. Excising the mass would require a larger incision and would be more likely to damage healthy tissue. Breast MRI is a very sensitive test, but it is not as specific as percutaneous biopsy. Hormonal evaluation is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of gynecomastia.

Percutaneous biopsy is the best option for diagnosing a breast mass in an African American man. It is accurate, safe, and minimally invasive.

 31%|███       | 474/1525 [1:56:54<4:20:38, 14.88s/it]The correct answer is C. Multiforme erythema.

Multiforme erythema is a skin condition that causes a rash with round or oval patches of red skin. The patches may blister and peel, and they often appear on the hands, feet, face, and genitals. Multiforme erythema can be caused by a number of things, including infections, medications, and autoimmune disorders.

The symptoms of multiforme erythema vary depending on the severity of the condition. Mild cases may only cause a few small patches of skin to become red and irritated. More severe cases may cause large areas of skin to blister and peel, and they may also be accompanied by fever, headache, and joint pain.

There is no cure for multiforme erythema, but the symptoms can usually be treated with medication. In most cases, the condition will go away on its own within a few weeks.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the symptoms of the patient in the case study. Bullous pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes blisters to form on the skin and mucous membranes. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a serious skin condition that causes the top layer of skin to peel off. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe allergic reaction that can cause blisters and peeling skin, as well as other symptoms such as fever, headache, and joint pain.

In the case study, the patient has a history of severe dysphagia and dysphonia. He also has several macules and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, and he has hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera. These symptoms are consistent with multiforme erythema. The patient also revealed that he had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. This further supports the diagnosis of multiforme erythema, as corticosteroids are a common treatment for this condition.

The patient's nasofibroscopy results showed generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa. This is also consistent with multiforme erythema, as this condition can affect the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.

The patient's skin was unremarkable, which rules out bullous pemphigus and toxic epidermal necrolysis. These conditions both cause blisters to form on the skin, which was not seen in the patient.

The patient did not have any fever, headache, or joint pain, which rules out Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This condition is a severe allergic reaction that can cause these symptoms, which were not seen in the patient.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Multiforme erythema. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the symptoms of the patient in the case study.

 31%|███       | 475/1525 [1:57:10<4:25:19, 15.16s/it]The correct answer is C. Papillary adenocarcinoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer in the nasopharynx, but it is not the only type. Papillary adenocarcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can also occur in the nasopharynx. It is characterized by the growth of papillary structures, which are finger-like projections of tissue. These papillary structures are often lined with cells that have nuclear grooves, which are indentations in the nucleus of the cell.

The patient in this case presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. He also complained of recurrent epistaxis. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging findings, and histopathological results, the most likely diagnosis is papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx. The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer in the nasopharynx, but it does not typically present with papillary structures or nuclear grooves.
* Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is not typically found in the nasopharynx.
* Chondrosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the cartilage. It is not typically found in the nasopharynx.

It is characterized by the formation of flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving painful erosions. The most common initial sites of involvement are the oral mucosa, followed by the skin. The disease can be life-threatening if left untreated.

The patient in the case presented with painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving his back, nose, lips, and mucosal lesions involving his oral cavity and oropharynx. The lesions initially only involved his lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while he was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. His medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of his oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds. A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results are all consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. The patient's history of psoriasis is also a risk factor for the development of pemphigus vulgaris.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can also present with ulcerative lesions. However, the patient in the case did not have any risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, and the biopsy results did not show any evidence of malignancy.

Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient in the case did not have any risk factors for paracoccidioidomycosis, and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was positive, which is a test that is used to screen for tuberculosis.

Lupus vulgaris is a type of cutaneous tuberculosis. However, the patient in the case did not have any risk factors for lupus vulgaris, and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was positive, which is a test that is used to screen for tuberculosis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is pemphigus vulgaris.

Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the salivary glands that is characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, into the salivary ducts. The condition is most commonly seen in middle-aged women and is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as asthma and eczema.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-year history of recurring left submandibular gland swelling and pain. She reported no associated fevers, chills, dryness of mouth, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia or odynophagia. Her medical history was unremarkable except for allergic rhinitis. On physical examination, she had slight enlargement of the left submandibular gland, which was not tender on palpation. Ultrasonography results revealed normal submandibular and parotid glands bilaterally without any mass or calcifications. Blood examinations and basic metabolic panel results were all within normal limits. Sialoendoscopy of the left submandibular duct was performed under general anesthesia. The patient was found to have a cast at the opening of the Wharton duct, which was removed and sent for pathological evaluation. Using sialoendoscopy with saline irrigation, the entire duct was examined up to the hilum of the gland. No stones were noted. There were areas of mild partial webbing without complete obstruction. The areas of webbing were broken up with irrigation, and at the end of the procedure steroid instillation and irrigation were performed. There were no complications during or after the procedure.

The histopathological findings of the cast showed numerous eosinophils, which is consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic sialodochitis. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation or the histopathological findings.

* IgG4-related sialadenitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the salivary glands that is characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells. The condition is most commonly seen in middle-aged men and is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune pancreatitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The patient in the case does not have any of the clinical features of IgG4-related sialadenitis, and the histopathological findings do not show the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells.
* Kimura disease is a rare, benign lymphoproliferative disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of lymphoid tissue in the submandibular and parotid glands. The condition is most commonly seen in young men and is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as asthma and eczema. The patient in the case does not have any of the clinical features of Kimura disease, and the histopathological findings do not show the presence of lymphoid tissue.
* Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a rare, benign vascular lesion that is characterized by the proliferation of blood vessels, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The condition is most commonly seen in middle-aged women and is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as asthma and eczema.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-day history of right eye pain and photophobia. She had undergone an uncomplicated Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy in the right eye 5 months before, which improved her corrected-distance visual acuity to 20/20 OD. She denied any history of ocular trauma or cold sores, and she was taking dexamethasone, 0.1% drops 4 times a day.

At presentation, her corrected-distance visual acuity was 20/60 OD. Slitlamp examination revealed a right inflamed conjunctiva with circumcorneal hyperemia, 2 mm × 2 mm epithelial defect with a small infiltrate at the temporal cornea, 2+ cells in the anterior chamber with a 1-mm hypopyon, and a peculiar graft-host interface haze with crisscross pattern. Corneal scrapes were performed and samples were sent for microscopy with Gram staining, culture, and sensitivity testing. The patient was admitted on that day and commenced taking topical cefuroxime, 5%, and gentamicin, 1.5%, drops every hour around the clock, and topical steroid was discontinued. One day later, there was no improvement in the graft-host interface haze, and results of microbiological investigations, including donor rim culture, were all negative. In view of the clinical dilemma, an in vivo confocal microscopy was performed to aid the diagnosis.

The in vivo confocal microscopy showed diffuse hyperreflective crisscross changes at the graft-host interface, which is a typical finding in fungal keratitis. Fungal keratitis is a serious infection of the cornea that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. It is caused by a variety of fungi, including Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida. The most common risk factors for fungal keratitis are contact lens use, trauma to the cornea, and use of topical steroids.

The treatment of fungal keratitis is with antifungal medications. Topical antifungals are the first-line treatment for most cases of fungal keratitis. Systemic antifungals may be necessary in severe cases or in cases that are not responding to topical therapy.

In the case presented, the patient had a positive in vivo confocal microscopy for fungal keratitis. She was started on topical and systemic antifungal treatment, and her condition improved. She was discharged from the hospital after 2 weeks of treatment, and she was able to maintain her corrected-distance visual acuity of 20/20 OD.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Start a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic such as moxifloxacin is incorrect because the patient has a fungal infection, not a bacterial infection.
* C. Restart topical steroid drops is incorrect because steroids can worsen fungal infections.
* D. Bring the patient to the operating room urgently and remove and send the DSAEK graft for microbiological culture and sensitivity is incorrect because the patient is responding to antifungal treatment and does not need surgery.

The patient is an 81-year-old Mexican man with multifocal choroidal lesions. The most likely diagnosis is birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR), a chronic, multifocal, inflammatory disorder of the choroid. BCR is associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A29 allele.

An interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is a test that measures the amount of interferon-γ produced by white blood cells in response to a specific antigen. IGRAs are used to diagnose BCR and other autoimmune diseases.

Empirical steroids are not recommended for the treatment of BCR. Steroids can worsen the inflammation and damage the retina.

Observation is not a recommended treatment for BCR. BCR is a progressive disease, and observation will not prevent the progression of the disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Interferon-γ release assay.

 31%|███▏      | 480/1525 [1:58:31<4:37:34, 15.94s/it]The correct answer is D. Provide patient education and observation.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is a medical emergency that can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. The goal of treatment is to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and open the angle.

A peripheral iridotomy is a procedure that creates a small hole in the iris to allow fluid to flow from the anterior chamber to the posterior chamber. This lowers IOP and opens the angle. However, a peripheral iridotomy is not always necessary in the setting of acute angle-closure glaucoma. In some cases, simply lowering IOP with medication can be enough to open the angle and prevent permanent vision loss.

An MRI is not necessary to diagnose acute angle-closure glaucoma. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history and examination findings. An MRI may be ordered to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a mass lesion or a stroke.

A clear lens extraction is a surgical procedure to remove the clear lens from the eye. This is not a necessary treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma. In fact, it can actually make the condition worse.

The best treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is to provide patient education and observation. The patient should be instructed to use eye drops to lower IOP and to return to the doctor for follow-up. The doctor will monitor the patient's IOP and visual acuity. If the patient's condition does not improve, a peripheral iridotomy may be necessary.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

A. Perform peripheral iridotomy: A peripheral iridotomy is a procedure that creates a small hole in the iris to allow fluid to flow from the anterior chamber to the posterior chamber. This lowers IOP and opens the angle. However, a peripheral iridotomy is not always necessary in the setting of acute angle-closure glaucoma. In some cases, simply lowering IOP with medication can be enough to open the angle and prevent permanent vision loss.

B. Order magnetic resonance imaging to investigate for masses: An MRI is not necessary to diagnose acute angle-closure glaucoma. The diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history and examination findings. An MRI may be ordered to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a mass lesion or a stroke.

C. Perform a clear lens extraction: A clear lens extraction is a surgical procedure to remove the clear lens from the eye. This is not a necessary treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma. In fact, it can actually make the condition worse.

D. Provide patient education and observation: The best treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is to provide patient education and observation. The patient should be instructed to use eye drops to lower IOP and to return to the doctor for follow-up. The doctor will monitor the patient's IOP and visual acuity. If the patient's condition does not improve, a peripheral iridotomy may be necessary.

The patient has a history of right temple melanoma that was excised with clean margins and accompanied by a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy result. He now presents with a newly noticed bulging left eye, several eyeglass prescription changes in the left eye over the past 2 years, frequent ipsilateral tearing, a mild limitation of left abduction and supraduction, 5 mm of relative left proptosis, moderate resistance to retropulsion of the left globe, and an abnormality of the posterior pole on dilated fundus examination.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes orbital tumors, Graves' disease, and thyroid eye disease. Orbital tumors can be benign or malignant, and they can arise from the orbit itself or from metastatic disease. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can lead to proptosis, eyelid retraction, and periorbital edema. Thyroid eye disease is a secondary condition to Graves' disease that can cause similar findings.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits is the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate a patient with a suspected orbital tumor or Graves' disease. MRI can provide detailed images of the soft tissues of the orbit, including the muscles, fat, and nerves. This information can be used to identify the location and size of a tumor, as well as the extent of any involvement of the surrounding structures. MRI can also be used to evaluate the thyroid gland and the surrounding tissues in patients with Graves' disease.

Applanation tonometry is a test that measures the intraocular pressure. It is not a sensitive or specific test for orbital tumors or Graves' disease.

Serum thyroid testing can be used to evaluate the function of the thyroid gland. It is not a sensitive or specific test for orbital tumors or Graves' disease.

Computed angiography of the head is a test that uses X-rays to visualize the blood vessels in the head. It is not a sensitive or specific test for orbital tumors or Graves' disease.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits. MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate a patient with a suspected orbital tumor or Graves' disease.

 32%|███▏      | 482/1525 [1:59:02<4:31:53, 15.64s/it]The correct answer is D. Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles. It is caused by antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which is the point where a nerve impulse is transmitted to a muscle. This causes the muscles to become weak and fatigued.

Myositis syndrome is a group of disorders that cause inflammation and damage to the muscles. There are many different types of myositis syndrome, but the most common is polymyositis. Polymyositis is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and damage to the muscles. It is characterized by muscle weakness, pain, and tenderness.

The patient in the case study presented with diplopia (double vision), myalgia (muscle pain), and weakness that mostly affected proximal muscle groups. Diplopia is a common symptom of myasthenia gravis, and myalgia is a common symptom of myositis syndrome. Weakness that mostly affects proximal muscle groups is also a common symptom of both myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome.

In addition to the clinical presentation, the patient's laboratory results were also consistent with myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome. The patient's acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels were elevated, which is a characteristic finding in myasthenia gravis. The patient's striated muscle antibody titer was also abnormal, which is a characteristic finding in myositis syndrome.

The patient's nerve conduction studies showed a normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation, which is also a characteristic finding in myasthenia gravis. Single-fiber electromyography was pathologic and revealed an abnormal mean consecutive difference in more than 50% of the tested pairs, which is a characteristic finding in myositis syndrome.

The patient's chest computed tomographic scan ruled out the presence of a thymoma, which is a tumor of the thymus gland that is associated with myasthenia gravis.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and electrodiagnostic studies, the most likely diagnosis is myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. It is caused by antibodies that attack the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves. This causes the nerves to become demyelinated, which can lead to weakness, numbness, and tingling.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. It is caused by antibodies that attack the calcium channels on the presynaptic nerve terminal. This causes the release of acetylcholine to be decreased, which can lead to weakness, fatigue, and muscle cramps.

Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare disorder that is characterized by ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the eye muscles), ataxia (loss of coordination), and areflexia (loss of reflexes). It is thought to be caused by an autoimmune attack on the peripheral nervous system.

The patient in the case study does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, or Miller Fisher syndrome. Therefore, these disorders are not the correct diagnosis.

 32%|███▏      | 483/1525 [1:59:19<4:36:09, 15.90s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain MRI of the head and orbits.

The patient is a 67-year-old white female with metastatic breast cancer, currently taking capecitabine plus trastuzumab. She presented with 2 weeks of painless reduced vision in her right eye. Her visual acuity was reduced to only being able to count fingers (worse than 20/400) OD and 20/40 in the left eye (OS). Visual acuity was 20/25 bilaterally at her last eye examination, 1 year prior. She reported not experiencing any headache, photophobia, diplopia, or eye pain. Ocular motility, pupillary response, and intraocular pressure were normal for each eye. On slit lamp examination, the anterior segment of each eye was normal, without inflammation or blood. On ophthalmoscopic examination, placoid yellow choroidal lesions with ill-defined borders and subretinal fluid were seen in each eye.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes:

* Breast cancer metastasis to the eye
* Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC)
* Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP)
* Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH)

The most likely diagnosis is breast cancer metastasis to the eye. This is supported by the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, her recent decline in visual acuity, and the presence of placoid yellow choroidal lesions with ill-defined borders and subretinal fluid on ophthalmoscopic examination.

The next step in management is to obtain an MRI of the head and orbits. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of breast cancer metastasis to the eye and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's visual loss.

If the MRI confirms the diagnosis of breast cancer metastasis to the eye, the patient's treatment will likely include systemic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to the eye.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Initiate high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication is not the correct answer because corticosteroids are not effective in treating breast cancer metastasis to the eye.
* B. Inject intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into both eyes is not the correct answer because VEGF inhibitors are not effective in treating breast cancer metastasis to the eye.
* D. Stop capecitabine and trastuzumab is not the correct answer because capecitabine and trastuzumab are effective in treating breast cancer, and there is no evidence that they are harmful to the eyes.

 32%|███▏      | 484/1525 [1:59:36<4:39:38, 16.12s/it]The correct answer is C: The patient has both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies.

The patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which is a surgical procedure that reduces the size of the stomach. This can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, including iron and vitamin B12. The patient also reports fatigue, loss of appetite, and hair loss, which are all symptoms of iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's physical examination findings are also consistent with these deficiencies. The patient's serum tests show that she has low levels of iron and vitamin B12.

The patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results all support the diagnosis of both iron and vitamin B12 deficiency.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

Answer choice A is incorrect because the patient does not have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, infertility, and acne. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not support the diagnosis of PCOS.

Answer choice B is incorrect because the patient does not have B12 deficiency alone. The patient's serum tests show that she has low levels of both iron and vitamin B12.

Answer choice D is incorrect because the patient does not have anemia of chronic disease. Anemia of chronic disease is a type of anemia that occurs in people with chronic illnesses such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, or kidney disease. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not support the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease.

The patient has a history of rectal carcinoma with lymph node metastasis, and the biopsy of the left vulva revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma. Mucinous adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that can spread to the skin, and it is the most common type of cancer that metastasizes to the vulva. The patient's symptoms, including the painful skin eruption, are consistent with metastatic mucinous carcinoma. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or her history of rectal carcinoma.

A. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the mucinous glands of the vulva. It is a rare type of cancer, and it is not associated with a history of rectal carcinoma.

B. Invasive extramammary Paget disease is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the skin. It is a rare type of cancer, and it is not associated with a history of rectal carcinoma.

 32%|███▏      | 486/1525 [2:00:02<4:16:02, 14.79s/it]The correct answer is D. Fibrous cephalic plaque.

A fibrous cephalic plaque is a benign, non-progressive, congenital fibrous plaque of the scalp that is typically present at birth or shortly thereafter. It is characterized by a firm, non-tender, plaque-like lesion that is often hairless and may be associated with hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation. The lesions are usually solitary, but multiple lesions may occur. The cause of fibrous cephalic plaques is unknown, but they are thought to be due to a localized defect in the development of the connective tissue.

Sclerotic neurofibroma is a type of neurofibroma, which is a benign tumor of the peripheral nerves. Neurofibromas are often associated with the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Sclerotic neurofibromas are typically firm, skin-colored or brown papules or nodules that may be present at birth or develop during childhood. They are often multiple and may be associated with other features of NF1, such as café au lait spots, Lisch nodules, and optic gliomas.

Familial cutaneous collagenoma is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple, small, skin-colored or brown papules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The papules are typically present at birth or develop during childhood. They are caused by a mutation in the COL5A1 gene, which codes for a type of collagen.

Shagreen patch is a skin lesion that is associated with tuberous sclerosis. It is characterized by a smooth, firm, warty plaque that is usually located on the lumbosacral region of the back. Shagreen patches are caused by a mutation in one of the genes that codes for a protein called tuberin.

In the case presented, the patient has a firm, non-tender, plaque-like lesion on the occipital scalp that is associated with hypopigmentation. The lesion was present at birth and has not changed in size or appearance. The patient does not have any other features of NF1, familial cutaneous collagenoma, or tuberous sclerosis. The most likely diagnosis is therefore fibrous cephalic plaque.

 32%|███▏      | 487/1525 [2:00:19<4:23:31, 15.23s/it]The correct answer is C. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atrophic variant.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, locally aggressive cutaneous neoplasm that is characterized by a storiform proliferation of spindle cells. The atrophic variant of DFSP is a rare subtype that is characterized by atrophic papules and plaques with overlying hyperpigmentation. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities and are often asymptomatic.

The diagnosis of DFSP is made on the basis of clinical and histopathologic findings. The characteristic histopathologic features of DFSP include a storiform proliferation of spindle cells, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity. The atrophic variant of DFSP may be difficult to distinguish from other cutaneous neoplasms, such as neurofibroma, anetoderma, and medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma. However, the atrophic variant of DFSP is typically more aggressive than these other neoplasms and is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and metastasis.

The treatment of DFSP is surgical excision. The atrophic variant of DFSP is often difficult to completely excise with conventional surgery. Therefore, Mohs micrographic surgery may be a more appropriate treatment option. Radiation therapy may also be used to treat DFSP, but it is not as effective as surgery. Chemotherapy is not typically used to treat DFSP.

The prognosis of DFSP is good with early diagnosis and treatment. However, the atrophic variant of DFSP is more aggressive than other subtypes of DFSP and is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor patients with DFSP, especially those with the atrophic variant.

Here are some reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Neurofibroma is a benign tumor of nerve tissue. It is typically a solitary lesion, but it can be multiple in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurofibromas are usually soft, skin-colored or brown nodules that can occur anywhere on the body. They are often asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, itching, and cosmetic problems. The diagnosis of neurofibroma is made on the basis of clinical findings and may be confirmed with imaging studies or biopsy. The treatment of neurofibroma is usually not necessary, but surgical excision may be indicated for symptomatic lesions.
* Anetoderma is a rare skin condition characterized by atrophic, depressed areas of skin. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities and are often asymptomatic. The diagnosis of anetoderma is made on the basis of clinical findings and may be confirmed with biopsy. The treatment of anetoderma is usually not necessary, but surgical excision may be indicated for cosmetically unacceptable lesions.
* Medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is a rare, benign skin lesion that is characterized by a coin-shaped or medallion-shaped area of hyperpigmentation. The lesions are typically located on the trunk or extremities and are often asymptomatic. The diagnosis of medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is made on the basis of clinical findings and may be confirmed with biopsy. The treatment of medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is usually not necessary, but surgical excision may be indicated for cosmetically unacceptable lesions.

This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by generalized muscle stiffness, fasciculations, and cramps. It is caused by antibodies that attack the nerves that control muscle movement. The symptoms of autoimmune Isaacs syndrome typically develop over time and can be quite disabling. There is no cure for autoimmune Isaacs syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically involves medications to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids or azathioprine. In some cases, plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be used.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Morvan syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by excessive sweating, tremor, insomnia, and hallucinations. It is not associated with muscle twitching or stiffness.
* Rippling muscle disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by involuntary, wave-like movements of the muscles. It is not associated with excessive sweating or other neurological symptoms.

 32%|███▏      | 489/1525 [2:00:50<4:28:56, 15.58s/it]The correct answer is A. Start corticosteroid therapy.

The patient has a history of vasospastic angina (VA), which is a condition in which the coronary arteries narrow suddenly and unpredictably. This can cause chest pain, heart attack, and sudden cardiac arrest. VA is often treated with medications that relax the arteries, such as nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers. In some cases, corticosteroid therapy may also be necessary.

Corticosteroids are a type of medication that can reduce inflammation. Inflammation is a natural process that helps the body heal, but it can also damage the arteries in people with VA. Corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow to the heart.

In the case of the patient in the question, she has already been treated with nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers, but her condition has not improved. She has also had multiple episodes of asystole, which is a type of cardiac arrest. This suggests that her VA is severe and that she is at high risk of further complications.

Given the patient's history and current condition, starting corticosteroid therapy is the most appropriate next step. Corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow to the heart, which may help to prevent further complications.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Reprogramming the ICD is not likely to be helpful, as the patient's ICD has already delivered a shock without preventing her from having further episodes of asystole. Surgical revascularization and percutaneous revascularization are both invasive procedures that are associated with risks, and they are not likely to be necessary in this case. The patient's VA is not caused by blockages in the coronary arteries, so these procedures would not be effective in treating her condition.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Start corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow to the heart, which may help to prevent further complications in this patient.

A lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells. It is the most common type of soft tissue tumor, and it is usually found in the subcutaneous tissue, which is the layer of fat that lies below the skin. Lipomas are usually slow-growing and painless, and they do not metastasize (spread to other parts of the body).

Ecchordosis physalsiphora is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the remnants of the notochord, which is a rod-shaped structure that forms the backbone in the embryo. Ecchordosis physalsiphora is usually found in the clivus, which is the part of the skull that separates the sphenoid sinus from the brain. It is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as headache, cranial nerve palsies, and hydrocephalus (a buildup of fluid in the brain).

Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage. It is the second most common primary bone cancer, after osteosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas can occur at any age, but they are most common in people in their 40s and 50s. They are usually found in the long bones of the arms and legs, but they can also occur in the pelvis, ribs, and skull. Chondrosarcomas are slow-growing tumors, and they often metastasize to the lungs.

The patient in the case presented with a 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus. The lesion was transosseous (i.e., it had grown through the bone) and was T1 dark, T2 bright, and multilobulated. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of chordoma. The pathological analysis of the biopsy specimen revealed sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, “soap bubble–like” cells with a myxoid background. These findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of chordoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical and pathological findings in the case. A lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells, and it would not be expected to be transosseous or to have the characteristic imaging findings of a chordoma. Ecchordosis physalsiphora is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the remnants of the notochord. It is usually found in the clivus, and it is not typically associated with the imaging findings seen in the case. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage, and it would not be expected to have the characteristic imaging findings of a chordoma.

Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare, neuroendocrine tumor of the olfactory epithelium. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and it is typically located in the olfactory bulb or cribriform plate. Sinonasal lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is most commonly seen in adults, and it is typically a high-grade lymphoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the nasopharynx, which is the part of the throat that is behind the nose. It is most commonly seen in people from Southeast Asia, and it is typically a low-grade carcinoma.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin.

The patient's presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of NUT carcinoma. NUT carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that is typically seen in young adults. It is characterized by the presence of a NUT gene rearrangement, which results in the overexpression of the NUT oncoprotein. The NUT oncoprotein is a transcription factor that promotes cell growth and proliferation. NUT carcinoma typically presents as a rapidly growing mass in the head and neck region. The most common sites of involvement are the sinonasal cavity, nasopharynx, and orbit. NUT carcinoma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and it has a poor prognosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare, neuroendocrine tumor of the olfactory epithelium. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and it is typically located in the olfactory bulb or cribriform plate.

This is because the patient has a family history of childhood-onset hearing loss, and genetic testing revealed a genetic mutation of the POU3F4 gene. POU3F4 is a gene that is essential for the development of the inner ear, and mutations in this gene can cause hearing loss.

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is a genetic disorder that can cause hearing loss, kidney malformations, and facial abnormalities. However, BOR is not typically associated with a family history of hearing loss.

Usher syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause hearing loss, vision loss, and balance problems. Usher syndrome is not typically associated with enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts or fistulous communication between the internal auditory canal and the basal turn of the cochlea.

Pendred syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause hearing loss, thyroid problems, and vestibular abnormalities. Pendred syndrome is not typically associated with bulbous dilation of the internal auditory canal.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests are most consistent with a diagnosis of XLD2.

 32%|███▏      | 493/1525 [2:01:48<4:16:50, 14.93s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain biopsy results.

The patient in the case study has a history of Lyme disease and presents with bilateral orbital masses. The MRI results show that the masses are low-intensity on T1 and T2 images and avidly enhance on postcontrast images. This suggests that the masses are likely neoplasms.

To further characterize the masses and determine the best course of treatment, it is important to obtain a biopsy. A biopsy will allow the pathologist to determine the type of neoplasm and whether it is malignant. This information will help the oncologist to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the patient's individual needs.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide the necessary information to make a diagnosis or determine the best course of treatment.

A thyroid function test would not be helpful in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of thyroid disease.

Doppler ultrasonography is a useful tool for evaluating blood flow, but it would not be helpful in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of vascular disease.

A chest computed tomography (CT) scan would not be helpful in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of lung cancer.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Obtain biopsy results. This is the only choice that will provide the necessary information to make a diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.

 32%|███▏      | 494/1525 [2:02:04<4:23:29, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation.

The patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of an Escherichia coli infection complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome. He presents with a visual acuity of 20/125 OD and 20/20 OS (HOTV letters), color vision that is severely diminished in the right eye, and no detectable stereoacuity. He has a mild relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye but no strabismus or nystagmus. Results of an anterior segment slitlamp biomicroscopy examination showed no abnormalities. Results of a dilated retinal examination showed a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye with temporal pallor of the optic disc. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated gliosis with a tractional epiretinal membrane and modest disorganization of the retinal layers, producing a sawtooth configuration within the outer plexiform layer.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes:

* Coats' disease: A retinal disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal lipid deposits in the retina. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults.
* Toxoplasmosis: An infection that is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. It can affect the eyes, brain, and other organs.
* Retinoblastoma: A rare type of cancer that affects the retina. It is most commonly seen in children under the age of 5.
* Vitreous hemorrhage: A bleeding into the vitreous humor, which is the clear fluid that fills the inside of the eye. It can be caused by a number of different conditions, including trauma, diabetes, and retinal detachment.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Coats' disease. Coats' disease is a retinal disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal lipid deposits in the retina. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The disease can cause vision loss if it is not treated.

The treatment for Coats' disease depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, the disease may be treated with laser therapy or cryotherapy. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the abnormal lipid deposits from the retina.

The patient in this case should be referred to a retinal specialist for further evaluation and treatment. The retinal specialist will likely order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to rule out any other possible causes of the patient's visual symptoms. The retinal specialist may also order a medical genetics evaluation to determine if the patient has a genetic predisposition to Coats' disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation.

* Option A: Refer patient for consideration of plaque brachytherapy or enucleation of the right eye. Plaque brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat certain types of cancer. Enucleation is a surgical procedure to remove the entire eye. These procedures are not appropriate for the treatment of Coats' disease.
* Option C: Start oral corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids are a type of medication that is used to reduce inflammation. They are not appropriate for the treatment of Coats' disease.
* Option D: Perform a vitreous tap and inject with antivirals. A vitreous tap is a procedure to remove fluid from the vitreous humor of the eye. Antivirals are medications that are used to treat viral infections. These procedures are not appropriate for the treatment of Coats' disease.

 32%|███▏      | 495/1525 [2:02:21<4:31:08, 15.79s/it]The correct answer is B. Surgery to create scleral windows.

The patient has a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the left eye. This is a condition in which the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, becomes detached from the underlying choroid. This can cause loss of vision, and if left untreated, can lead to blindness.

The most common cause of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a tear in the retina. This can be caused by trauma, such as a blow to the eye, or by a condition that weakens the retina, such as myopia (nearsightedness) or vitreous detachment.

In this case, the patient has a choroidal detachment, which is a collection of fluid in the space between the retina and the choroid. This can cause the retina to detach.

The patient has already been treated with oral prednisone and a posterior sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide. These treatments have not been successful in reattaching the retina.

The next step in treatment is surgery to create scleral windows. This is a procedure in which small incisions are made in the sclera, the white of the eye. These incisions allow fluid to drain from the subretinal space, which helps to reattach the retina.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing is not the best treatment for a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. This procedure is used to remove vitreous humor from the eye, which is the jelly-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina. It is not used to treat retinal detachment.
* Surgery to create a scleral buckle is a treatment option for retinal detachment, but it is not the best option for this patient. This procedure involves placing a band of material around the eye to create pressure on the sclera. This pressure helps to reattach the retina. However, in this case, the patient already has a choroidal detachment, which makes it difficult to create enough pressure with a scleral buckle.
* Immunosuppressive therapy is not a treatment option for retinal detachment. This type of therapy is used to suppress the immune system, which can be helpful in treating certain autoimmune diseases. However, it is not effective in treating retinal detachment.

The patient has type 1 diabetes and has developed diabetic retinopathy, which is a condition that can lead to blindness. The patient has substantial loss of visual acuity in the left eye, and there is considerable retinal thickening, substantial capillary nonperfusion in the macular area, and a large area of disc neovascularization (in more than one-third of the disc area), with leakage on the disc associated with prepapillary neovascularization.

Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are a treatment for diabetic retinopathy that is used to stop the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. These injections are given into the vitreous, the clear gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. Anti-VEGF injections can improve vision and reduce the risk of blindness in people with diabetic retinopathy.

Laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy that is used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This treatment is typically done in one or two sessions. PRP can improve vision and reduce the risk of blindness in people with diabetic retinopathy.

Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser is a surgical procedure that is used to treat diabetic retinopathy. This procedure is typically done in people who have severe diabetic retinopathy that has not responded to other treatments. Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser can improve vision and reduce the risk of blindness in people with diabetic retinopathy.

The correct answer is C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation because this is the most effective treatment for the patient's condition. Anti-VEGF injections will stop the growth of new blood vessels in the retina, and PRP will destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Both of these treatments are necessary to improve the patient's vision and reduce the risk of blindness.

Answer A, Laser panretinal photocoagulation, is incorrect because it is not the most effective treatment for the patient's condition. PRP is necessary to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina, but it is not enough to improve the patient's vision. Anti-VEGF injections are also necessary to stop the growth of new blood vessels in the retina.

Answer B, Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections, is incorrect because it is not the most effective treatment for the patient's condition. Anti-VEGF injections can improve vision and reduce the risk of blindness, but they are not enough to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina. PRP is also necessary to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina.

Answer D, Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser, is incorrect because it is not the most effective treatment for the patient's condition. Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser is a surgical procedure that is typically done in people who have severe diabetic retinopathy that has not responded to other treatments. The patient's condition is not severe enough to warrant this procedure.

 33%|███▎      | 497/1525 [2:02:43<3:52:24, 13.56s/it]The correct answer is A: Observe.

The patient in this case presented with bilateral blurry vision occurring 2 hours after a car crash. At the moment of impact, she was wearing her seat belt, the airbag deployed, and an intense flexion-extension head movement occurred. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/63 OS. Intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed no palpebral hematoma, and the anterior segment was found to be normal. On the fundus bilaterally, we only noted an alteration of the foveal reflection, with neither retinae commotio nor hemorrhages. Macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities. Central subfield thickness was 696 μm in the right eye and 392 μm in the left eye.

The first step in managing this patient is to rule out any serious underlying causes of her visual loss. This includes a complete history and physical examination, as well as appropriate imaging studies. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are unremarkable, and her imaging studies are normal. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that she has any serious underlying causes of her visual loss.

The next step is to determine the cause of her macular edema. There are many potential causes of macular edema, including retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and posterior vitreous detachment. In this case, the patient's macular edema is most likely due to post-traumatic vitreous hemorrhage. This is a common finding after a car crash, and it can lead to macular edema due to inflammation and blockage of the retinal capillaries.

The treatment of post-traumatic macular edema is controversial. Some experts recommend systemic or intraocular corticosteroid therapy, while others believe that observation is the best course of action. In this case, I believe that observation is the best course of action for several reasons. First, the patient's macular edema is mild and there is no evidence of retinal ischemia. Second, systemic or intraocular corticosteroid therapy can have serious side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation. Third, there is no evidence that these therapies are effective in treating post-traumatic macular edema.

Therefore, I would recommend observing the patient for a period of time. If her macular edema does not improve or worsen, then I would consider further treatment options. However, at this time, I believe that observation is the best course of action.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy: This is a possible treatment option for post-traumatic macular edema, but it is not without risks. Systemic corticosteroids can cause increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation, while intraocular corticosteroids can cause retinal toxicity. In this case, I believe that the risks of corticosteroid therapy outweigh the potential benefits.
* C. Epiretinal membrane peeling in the left eye: This is a surgical procedure that is used to remove an epiretinal membrane, which is a thin, transparent membrane that can form on the surface of the retina. Epiretinal membranes can cause retinal edema and vision loss. In this case, there is no evidence that the patient has an epiretinal membrane. Therefore, epiretinal membrane peeling would not be an appropriate treatment option.
* D. Bilateral antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy: This is a treatment option for diabetic retinopathy and other retinal vascular diseases. However, it is not effective in treating post-traumatic macular edema. In this case, I believe that bilateral antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy would not be an appropriate treatment option.

A. Cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer is incorrect because the patient did not have any symptoms of small cell lung cancer, such as cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Additionally, the lesion was located on the scapular region, which is not a common site for metastasis from small cell lung cancer.

B. Loxoscelism is incorrect because the patient did not have any history of exposure to a brown recluse spider, which is the only spider that can cause loxoscelism. Additionally, the lesion was not located in a typical location for loxoscelism, which is the extremities.

C. Merkel cell carcinoma is the correct answer because the patient presented with a rapidly enlarging, painful lesion with a violaceous appearance. Additionally, the patient had enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical regions. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that is most common in elderly people. It is often misdiagnosed as other skin conditions, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma is made by biopsy. Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

D. Primary cutaneous lymphoma (Sézary syndrome) is incorrect because the patient did not have any symptoms of Sézary syndrome, such as generalized lymphadenopathy, skin rash, or fever. Additionally, the lesion was not located in a typical location for Sézary syndrome, which is the skin.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) that occurs when the electrical activity in the upper chambers of the heart (atria) becomes chaotic. This can cause the heart to beat irregularly and too fast, which can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain.

The ECG in the question shows irregular, chaotic waves in the atria, which are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The other choices are incorrect because they do not describe the ECG findings in this case.

Atrial fibrillation is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and blood clots. It is important to see a doctor if you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Treatment may include medications, surgery, or other procedures to control the arrhythmia and prevent complications.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* Choice A: Review the ECG for frequent atrial ectopic beats. Atrial ectopic beats are premature beats that originate in the atria. They can be seen on an ECG as early, abnormal beats that are not preceded by a P wave. However, the ECG in the question does not show any atrial ectopic beats.
* Choice B: Review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that occurs when the electrical activity in the upper chambers of the heart (atria) becomes chaotic. This can cause the heart to beat irregularly and too fast, which can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The ECG in the question shows irregular, chaotic waves in the atria, which are characteristic of atrial fibrillation.
* Choice C: Review the ECG for atrial flutter with varying AV block. Atrial flutter is a type of arrhythmia that occurs when the electrical activity in the upper chambers of the heart (atria) becomes organized but rapid. This can cause the heart to beat irregularly and too fast, which can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The ECG in the question does not show any features of atrial flutter.
* Choice D: Review the ECG for features of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia that occurs when the electrical activity in the upper chambers of the heart (atria) becomes chaotic and originates from multiple sites. This can cause the heart to beat irregularly and too fast, which can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The ECG in the question does not show any features of multifocal atrial tachycardia.

A1-antitrypsin is a protein that helps protect the lungs from damage caused by enzymes such as neutrophil elastase. People with a deficiency of A1-antitrypsin are at increased risk of developing emphysema, a progressive lung disease characterized by the destruction of the air sacs in the lungs.

The patient in this case has a history of tobacco use, which is a major risk factor for emphysema. She also has clinical features consistent with emphysema, including progressive cough, dyspnea, and reduced pulmonary function tests. In addition, she has a family history of liver cirrhosis, which can be a complication of A1-antitrypsin deficiency.

Based on these findings, it is reasonable to suspect that the patient has A1-antitrypsin deficiency. To confirm the diagnosis, it is necessary to measure the patient's serum A1-antitrypsin level and genotype. A low serum A1-antitrypsin level and a specific genotype are diagnostic of A1-antitrypsin deficiency.

If the patient is found to have A1-antitrypsin deficiency, she should be referred to a specialist for management of her condition. There is no cure for A1-antitrypsin deficiency, but treatment can help to slow the progression of emphysema and improve the quality of life for people with the condition.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Order bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. This procedure is not necessary to diagnose A1-antitrypsin deficiency.
* Option C: Order inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing. Inhaled nasal nitric oxide is a treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and ciliary dyskinesia is a genetic disorder that affects the cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that help to move mucus out of the lungs. These conditions are not associated with A1-antitrypsin deficiency.
* Option D: Assess sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening. Sweat chloride testing is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis genetic screening is used to identify people who are at risk for developing cystic fibrosis. These conditions are not associated with A1-antitrypsin deficiency.

 33%|███▎      | 501/1525 [2:03:49<4:27:54, 15.70s/it]The correct diagnosis is A. Mycosis fungoides.

Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare type of skin cancer. It is the most common form of CTCL, accounting for about 70% of cases. It is typically a slow-growing disease, and most people with mycosis fungoides live for many years with the disease.

The initial symptoms of mycosis fungoides are usually small, scaly patches on the skin. These patches may be red, brown, or purple, and they may be itchy. As the disease progresses, the patches may become larger and more widespread. They may also become thickened and scaly, and they may ulcerate.

Mycosis fungoides is diagnosed with a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of abnormal T cells, which are the white blood cells that are involved in the immune system.

There is no cure for mycosis fungoides, but there are treatments that can help to control the disease. Treatment may include topical creams, oral medications, and radiation therapy. In some cases, bone marrow transplantation may be used.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient.

* Large-plaque parapsoriasis is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by scaly, hypopigmented patches on the skin. It is not a type of cancer.
* Cutaneous amyloidosis is a condition that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the skin. It is not a type of cancer.

ILH is a rare, benign disorder of the lymphatic system characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes in the lymphatic vessels. It typically presents as a single, linear, or arborizing plaque on the skin, with a predilection for the extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis is made on histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy, which shows a dense infiltrate of histiocytes in the lymphatic vessels. There is no specific treatment for ILH, but most cases resolve spontaneously within a few months to years.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Linear morphea is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of hard, white plaques on the skin. It typically affects women in their 20s and 30s. The lesions of linear morphea are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis is made on clinical examination and confirmed by skin biopsy. There is no cure for linear morphea, but treatment can help to improve the appearance of the lesions and prevent new lesions from forming.
* Serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation is a benign condition characterized by the formation of long, wavy streaks of hyperpigmentation on the skin. It is usually caused by sun exposure and is more common in people with dark skin. The lesions of serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis is made on clinical examination. There is no treatment for serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation, but sun protection can help to prevent the lesions from getting worse.
* Intraoperative cutaneous electrical injury (Lichtenberg figure) is a transient skin lesion that can occur during surgery when an electrical current passes through the skin. It is characterized by a linear or branching pattern of erythema and edema. The lesions of intraoperative cutaneous electrical injury are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally be painful. The diagnosis is made on clinical examination. There is no treatment for intraoperative cutaneous electrical injury, but the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few days.

Diffuse melanosis cutis is a rare skin condition characterized by diffuse, non-scaly, brown or black hyperpigmentation of the skin. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including sun exposure, certain medications, and hormonal changes. In this case, the patient's diffuse melanosis cutis is most likely due to his pembrolizumab therapy. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking the PD-1 pathway, which is involved in the regulation of the immune system. In some patients, pembrolizumab can cause a condition called immune-mediated skin pigmentation, which is characterized by diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. This can lead to a buildup of iron in the organs, which can cause a variety of health problems, including liver damage, heart disease, and diabetes. However, hemochromatosis does not typically cause diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin.
* Addison disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the adrenal glands to produce too little cortisol and aldosterone. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and low blood pressure. However, Addison disease does not typically cause diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin.
* Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure is a common skin condition that is caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. UV rays can damage the skin's melanocytes, which are the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. This can lead to the development of dark spots on the skin, which are often referred to as sunspots or age spots. However, hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure is typically limited to the areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as the face, neck, and hands. In this case, the patient's diffuse hyperpigmentation cutis is not consistent with sun exposure, as it is affecting areas of the skin that are not typically exposed to the sun, such as the abdomen and chest.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Diffuse melanosis cutis. The patient's diffuse melanosis cutis is most likely due to his pembrolizumab therapy.

The patient has a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and has undergone an implant of a subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) for secondary prevention. Two weeks later, she presents to the emergency department (ED) after receiving several shocks from the device during the early morning. There were no reported symptoms associated with shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope. Physical examination results revealed no signs of decompensated heart failure. Device interrogation results showed shock therapies delivered postimplant on days 3, 5, 6, and 10. The surface electrogram from the events, recorded at a paper speed of 25 millimeters per second and an amplitude of 2.5 mm/mvV) is shown in Figure 1. Repeated chest radiography at the ED showed appropriate device location, lead pin, and an absence of subcutaneous air trapping at the proximal and distal sense electrodes.

The surface electrogram from the events shows a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of approximately 230 beats per minute. The rhythm is consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT). The S-ICD delivered shocks to terminate the VT.

The next step in management is to reprogram the S-ICD to a lower shock zone. The current shock zone is 200-230 beats per minute. This means that the S-ICD will deliver a shock if the heart rate exceeds 200 beats per minute. However, the patient's VT was occurring at a rate of approximately 230 beats per minute. Therefore, the S-ICD delivered a shock unnecessarily.

Reprogramming the S-ICD to a lower shock zone will prevent unnecessary shocks. The lower shock zone should be set to a rate that is above the patient's ventricular rate during sinus rhythm, but below the rate at which the patient's VT is occurring. In this case, the lower shock zone could be set to 210 beats per minute.

The patient should also be observed for recurrent VT. If the patient continues to have VT, further management may be necessary, such as catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Administer anticoagulation and increase the dose of the β-blocker. This is not the correct management for a patient with VT. Anticoagulation and β-blockers are used to prevent thromboembolism and to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with VT. However, these medications will not prevent or treat VT.
* Option C: Administer a loading dose of amiodarone. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat VT. However, amiodarone is a potentially toxic medication and should only be used when there is no other option. In this case, the patient's VT is self-terminating and does not require treatment with amiodarone.
* Option D: Refer the patient for catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is a procedure that can be used to destroy the areas of the heart that are causing VT. However, catheter ablation is not necessary for all patients with VT. In this case, the patient's VT is self-terminating and does not require treatment with catheter ablation.

A. Human papillomavirus–related squamous cell carcinoma is incorrect because the patient is a young woman with no history of tobacco or alcohol use, and the lesion is not associated with any of the risk factors for human papillomavirus–related squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or oral sex.

C. Ulcerated plexiform neurofibroma is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the clinical features of neurofibromatosis, such as café au lait spots or neurofibromas on other parts of the body.

D. Ulcerated granular cell tumor is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the clinical features of granular cell tumor, such as a history of trauma to the tongue or a family history of granular cell tumor.

The patient's history of a 1-year history of a right tongue mass that developed after initial bite trauma, the clinical presentation of a 3 × 2-cm, exophytic and raised, plateaulike lesion on the right dorsolateral tongue with approximately 1 to 2 cm of surrounding induration, and the histopathologic findings of ulceration, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and abundant acute and chronic inflammation replete with eosinophils are all consistent with the diagnosis of schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction.

Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor, accounting for approximately 50% of all nerve sheath tumors. Schwannomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. They are usually solitary tumors, but they can occur in multiple locations (multifocal schwannomas) or as part of a syndrome, such as neurofibromatosis type 2.

The clinical presentation of schwannomas varies depending on the location of the tumor. Schwannomas in the head and neck region can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected area. They can also cause facial asymmetry or a mass in the neck.

The diagnosis of schwannoma is made based on clinical presentation, imaging studies (such as magnetic resonance imaging), and biopsy. Schwannomas are typically benign tumors, but they can rarely become malignant. Treatment for schwannomas typically involves surgical resection.

The patient has a history of HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. He has a CD4 count of 31 cells/μL, which is low. He has also completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission.

On physical examination, the patient has evidence of perforation of the hard palate. A computed tomographic scan of the chest reveals necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed.

The microscopic view of the biopsy specimen from the hard palate shows Histoplasma capsulatum organisms. This is a fungus that is found in soil and can be inhaled into the lungs. In people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV infection, Histoplasma capsulatum can cause a serious infection of the lungs, called histoplasmosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

Tuberculosis of the palate is a rare complication of tuberculosis. It is usually seen in patients with advanced disease. The patient in this case does not have advanced tuberculosis.

Tertiary syphilis is a late stage of syphilis that can cause a variety of symptoms, including perforation of the hard palate. However, the patient in this case does not have any other symptoms of tertiary syphilis.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease that can cause inflammation of the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and other organs. It is not associated with perforation of the hard palate.

 33%|███▎      | 507/1525 [2:05:17<4:15:26, 15.06s/it]The correct answer is B: Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with posterior capsular opacification (PCO). PCO is a common complication of cataract surgery, in which the posterior capsule of the lens becomes opaque. This can occur due to the growth of cells or the accumulation of debris on the capsule. PCO can cause blurred vision, glare, and halos.

The treatment for PCO is to perform a posterior capsulotomy. This is a procedure in which a small opening is made in the posterior capsule using a laser. This allows light to reach the retina and improve vision.

The Nd:YAG laser is the most common type of laser used for posterior capsulotomy. It is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Perform posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy. This is an invasive procedure that is not necessary for the treatment of PCO.
* Option C: Exchange the IOL. This is a more invasive procedure than posterior capsulotomy and is not necessary for the treatment of PCO.
* Option D: Observe the patient. This is not an appropriate treatment for PCO. PCO can cause significant visual impairment and should be treated promptly.

 33%|███▎      | 508/1525 [2:05:30<4:07:02, 14.57s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform superficial corneal biopsy.

The patient has bilateral, gray-white, irregular, poorly circumscribed, linear and nummular central and peripheral corneal opacities, confined primarily to the subepithelium and focally to the underlying anterior stroma. The epithelium itself and deeper corneal stroma were spared, and the remainder of her anterior segment and fundus examination results were within normal limits. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography documented deposition of hyperreflective material in the subepithelium with trace deposition in the anterior stroma.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome-associated corneal infiltrates. Sjögren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, including the lacrimal and salivary glands. This can lead to dry eyes and dry mouth, as well as other systemic manifestations.

Corneal infiltrates are a common ocular complication of Sjögren syndrome. They typically present as small, white or gray opacities in the cornea. The infiltrates may be superficial or deep, and they can be single or multiple. They may be associated with pain, redness, and blurred vision.

The treatment of Sjögren syndrome-associated corneal infiltrates is aimed at reducing inflammation and improving tear production. Topical steroids and artificial tears are often used. In some cases, oral steroids may be necessary. In rare cases, penetrating keratoplasty may be required to remove the infiltrates and restore vision.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the correct next step is to perform a superficial corneal biopsy. This will allow the physician to obtain a sample of the corneal tissue for histopathological examination. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome-associated corneal infiltrates and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, begin oral acyclovir sodium, is incorrect because the patient does not have a viral infection.
* Option B, perform penetrating keratoplasty, is incorrect because the patient's corneal infiltrates are superficial and do not require surgical intervention.
* Option C, initiate topical cyclosporine, is incorrect because cyclosporine is not effective for the treatment of Sjögren syndrome-associated corneal infiltrates.

Therefore, the correct next step in the management of this patient is to perform a superficial corneal biopsy.

 33%|███▎      | 509/1525 [2:05:47<4:15:25, 15.08s/it]The correct answer is Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection. The patient's iris lesion has grown significantly in a short period of time, and it is now involving the visual axis. This indicates that the lesion is likely to continue to grow and cause further vision loss. Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection is a minimally invasive procedure that has been shown to be effective in treating iris cysts. The alcohol destroys the cyst lining and causes the cyst to collapse. This procedure is generally safe and effective, and it can be performed on an outpatient basis. Surgical resection is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for larger or more complex cysts. Laser cystotomy is a less invasive procedure than aspiration with absolute alcohol injection, but it is not as effective. Laser cystotomy may be an option for patients who are not good candidates for other procedures, such as those with a history of bleeding or who have other medical conditions that make surgery risky. However, laser cystotomy is more likely to result in recurrence of the cyst than aspiration with absolute alcohol injection. Continued monitoring is not an appropriate option for this patient because the lesion is growing and causing vision loss. The patient should undergo a procedure to remove the cyst in order to preserve his vision.

 33%|███▎      | 510/1525 [2:05:58<3:58:19, 14.09s/it]The correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits.

Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment for cancer that uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It is not a treatment for choroidal masses, which are non-cancerous tumors.

Pars plana lensectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a cataractous lens. It is not a treatment for choroidal masses.

Biopsy of the choroidal mass is a procedure to remove a piece of the tumor for testing. It is not a definitive treatment for choroidal masses, and it is not the first step in the management of these tumors.

MRI of the brain and orbits is the best initial test to evaluate a choroidal mass. It can help to determine the size, location, and shape of the tumor, as well as whether it has spread to other parts of the body. MRI can also help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

If the MRI shows that the choroidal mass is benign, the patient may be monitored without further treatment. However, if the MRI shows that the tumor is malignant, the patient may need surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. MRI is the best initial test to evaluate a choroidal mass and help to determine the best course of treatment.

 34%|███▎      | 511/1525 [2:06:13<3:59:22, 14.16s/it]The correct answer is B. Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNSL).

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause brain lesions in immunocompromised patients. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for toxoplasmosis, such as exposure to cats or eating undercooked meat. Additionally, the patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a white blood cell count of 51 cells/μL with 92% lymphocytes, which is consistent with PCNSL but not with toxoplasmosis.

Glioblastoma is a type of brain tumor that is most common in older adults. The patient in this case is in her 30s, which is a relatively young age for glioblastoma. Additionally, the patient's brain imaging showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions, which is more typical of PCNSL than glioblastoma.

Metastatic disease from an unknown primary neoplasm is a possibility, but it is less likely than PCNSL in this case. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any other areas of cancer, and her brain imaging showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions, which is more typical of PCNSL than metastatic disease.

PCNSL is a rare but serious complication of organ transplantation. It is characterized by the proliferation of B cells in the central nervous system. The most common risk factor for PCNSL is immunosuppression, such as that used after organ transplantation. Other risk factors include Epstein-Barr virus infection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The clinical presentation of PCNSL varies depending on the location of the lesions. Common symptoms include headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and altered mental status. Diagnosis is made with brain imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of approximately 12 months.

In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is B. Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. The other choices are incorrect because they are less likely in this case based on the patient's history, physical examination, and brain imaging.

 34%|███▎      | 512/1525 [2:06:30<4:12:32, 14.96s/it]The correct answer is C. Prescribe oral azithromycin.

The patient has a history of recurrent oral lesions that are consistent with a diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and pharyngitis. In some cases, it can also cause oral lesions.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. He has a history of recurrent oral lesions, and his current symptoms include fever, cough, and pharyngitis. His laboratory tests are also consistent with a diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. His serum enzyme immunoassay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM is positive at 1280 U/mL.

The treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is with antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are azithromycin and erythromycin. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is well-tolerated and has few side effects. Erythromycin is another macrolide antibiotic that is effective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is also well-tolerated and has few side effects.

The patient should be prescribed oral azithromycin for the treatment of his Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. He should also be advised to rest and drink plenty of fluids. He should avoid contact with people who are sick to prevent the spread of infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Perform upper endoscopy and colonoscopy is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a gastrointestinal problem.

B. Test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest an autoimmune disorder.

D. Prescribe oral suspension nystatin is incorrect because nystatin is an antifungal medication that is not effective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

 34%|███▎      | 513/1525 [2:06:43<4:06:18, 14.60s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform detailed review of systemic and topical medications.

The patient has a history of hypertension and palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. These conditions are often treated with medications that can cause anisocoria, such as beta blockers, alpha blockers, and anticholinergics. It is therefore important to review the patient's medication history to identify any possible causes of the dilated pupil.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Order computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve. This is an invasive test that is not necessary in this case. The patient has a normal neurologic examination and there is no evidence of a third cranial nerve palsy.
* B. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out a brainstem stroke. This is also an invasive test that is not necessary in this case. The patient has a normal neurologic examination and there is no evidence of a brainstem stroke.
* D. Perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome. This is a test that is used to confirm Horner syndrome, which is a rare condition that can cause anisocoria. The patient does not have any of the other symptoms of Horner syndrome, such as ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Therefore, there is no need to perform this test.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Perform detailed review of systemic and topical medications. This is the most likely cause of the patient's dilated pupil and it is the least invasive test that can be performed to rule out other possible causes.

 34%|███▎      | 514/1525 [2:06:57<3:59:59, 14.24s/it]The correct answer is B. Stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy.

The patient in the case has a number of risk factors for tuberculosis, including being a Vietnamese man who immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago, having chronic hepatitis B with cirrhosis, and having a history of nonproductive cough, 5-kg weight loss, and fatigue. In addition, the patient's chest radiographic image suggests cardiomegaly and a computed tomographic scan demonstrates a moderate to large pericardial effusion. These findings are all consistent with tuberculosis.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme that is found in high levels in the pericardial fluid of patients with tuberculosis. The patient's ADA level of 118.1 U/L is significantly elevated, which is further evidence of tuberculosis.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, it is highly likely that the patient has tuberculosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: Perform additional pericardial effusion cytology and culture testing. This is not necessary because the patient's ADA level is already highly elevated, which is diagnostic of tuberculosis.
* Choice C: Initiate oral colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids for systemic inflammation. This is not the appropriate treatment for tuberculosis.
* Choice D: Perform an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). This is a test that can be used to diagnose tuberculosis, but it is not necessary in this case because the patient's ADA level is already highly elevated.

 34%|███▍      | 515/1525 [2:07:08<3:46:55, 13.48s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass.

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis who presented to the emergency department with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. He stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. He had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. His temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact (Figure 1).

The most likely diagnosis is a renal mass. The patient's history of nephrolithiasis is a risk factor for renal cell carcinoma. The CT scan findings are consistent with a renal mass. The next step in management is to perform an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the mass.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of esophageal or gastric disease. Diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any signs of peritoneal inflammation. Interventional radiology–guided biopsy of the mass is not indicated in this case because the patient has a well-circumscribed mass that is amenable to surgical excision.

 34%|███▍      | 516/1525 [2:07:21<3:43:51, 13.31s/it]The correct answer is A. Disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination.

The patient in the case is a woman in her 50s with relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia and a remote history of breast cancer. She was admitted for treatment of presumed fungal pneumonia based on new pulmonary nodules on imaging and elevated serum β-D-glucan levels. She subsequently developed multiple asymptomatic pink papules on the trunk and extremities. The patient was afebrile and was receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral treatment for a prior episode of neutropenic fever.

Clinical examination revealed scattered pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core scattered throughout the chest, abdomen, back, groin, and upper and lower extremities. Laboratory workup was significant for leukopenia with neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Creatinine and transaminase levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures were negative. A punch biopsy from the left flank was obtained for hematoxylin-eosin staining, and a punch biopsy from the left leg was sent for tissue and fungal culture. Histopathological analysis was subsequently performed.

The histopathological findings showed a subcorneal pustular dermatitis with yeast forms and pseudohyphae in the stratum corneum. These findings are consistent with disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination.

Disseminated candidiasis is a serious infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems. The infection can spread to the bloodstream, organs, and other parts of the body. Transepidermal elimination is a process in which the body releases infected cells through the skin.

The patient in the case has several risk factors for disseminated candidiasis, including her leukemia, her prior history of breast cancer, and her neutropenia. The findings on her physical examination and the results of her laboratory tests are also consistent with disseminated candidiasis.

The treatment for disseminated candidiasis includes antifungal medications. The patient in the case was treated with fluconazole, an antifungal medication. She responded well to treatment and her symptoms resolved.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Reactive perforating collagenosis is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes the skin to break down and form papules and pustules. It is not associated with leukemia or other underlying medical conditions.
* Disseminated cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can spread to the bloodstream, organs, and other parts of the body. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems. The patient in the case does not have any risk factors for cryptococcosis.
* Malassezia (formerly Pityrosporum) folliculitis is a common skin infection that causes folliculitis, or inflammation of the hair follicles. It is not associated with leukemia or other underlying medical conditions.

Benign acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition that causes thick, velvety, dark patches of skin. It is most common in the armpits, groin, neck, and under the breasts. Benign acanthosis nigricans is usually not serious and does not require treatment. However, it can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as obesity, diabetes, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of skin cancer. It is characterized by the growth of abnormal T cells in the skin. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, lymph node enlargement, and fever.

Malignant acanthosis nigricans is a rare skin condition that is associated with an underlying malignancy. It is characterized by the development of thick, velvety, dark patches of skin. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most commonly associated with cancers of the stomach, esophagus, colon, and pancreas.

Malignant Addison disease is a rare, life-threatening condition that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. Symptoms of malignant Addison disease include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The correct answer is C. Malignant acanthosis nigricans because the patient in the case presentation has a history of weight loss, abdominal discomfort, and elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen and carbohydrate antigen 242. These findings are consistent with an underlying malignancy. The patient also has verrucous plaques on the lips and gingiva, which are characteristic of malignant acanthosis nigricans.

Benign acanthosis nigricans is not associated with weight loss, abdominal discomfort, or elevated levels of tumor markers. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of skin cancer, and the patient in the case presentation does not have any skin lesions. Malignant Addison disease is a rare, life-threatening condition that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. The patient in the case presentation does not have any symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.

Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica is a rare skin condition that is associated with internal malignancy. It is characterized by erythema, scaling, and hyperkeratosis of the acral skin (the skin of the hands and feet). The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic features of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica.

Purpura fulminans is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by widespread purpura (purple discoloration of the skin) and microvascular thrombosis. It is most commonly seen in children and is associated with sepsis, meningococcemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient in this case does not have any of the risk factors for purpura fulminans.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis that is characterized by purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis, and nephritis. It is most commonly seen in children and is thought to be an autoimmune condition. The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic features of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the blood vessels in the skin. It is most commonly seen in adults and is associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and medications. The patient in this case has several risk factors for cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, including her age, smoking history, and the presence of a lung mass. The clinical presentation of the patient is also consistent with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The skin biopsy specimen shows the characteristic features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, including perivascular inflammation with neutrophils, nuclear dust, and fibrinoid necrosis.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis for the patient is cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

 34%|███▍      | 519/1525 [2:08:11<4:20:18, 15.53s/it]The correct answer is C. Treat medically with aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin.

The patient has an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is a medical emergency. The goal of treatment is to restore blood flow to the heart muscle as quickly as possible to minimize damage.

The first step in treatment is to give aspirin, which helps to prevent blood clots. A β-blocker is also given to lower the heart rate and blood pressure. Clopidogrel is a blood thinner that helps to prevent further clots. A statin is given to lower cholesterol, which can help to prevent future heart attacks.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a procedure that can be used to open up a blocked artery. However, it is not always necessary, and it is not the first-line treatment for STEMI. In this case, the patient's artery is only mildly blocked, so PCI is not necessary.

The patient should be monitored closely in the hospital for any signs of complications. She should also be given lifestyle advice to help prevent a future heart attack, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

Aspirin alone is not enough to treat a STEMI. Aspirin is a blood thinner, but it does not lower cholesterol or blood pressure. It also does not help to prevent blood clots.

Aspirin, β-blocker, and clopidogrel are not enough to treat a STEMI. These medications are all important in treating a STEMI, but they do not provide complete treatment. A statin is also needed to lower cholesterol and prevent future heart attacks.

Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention and start medical therapy is not the correct answer because PCI is not always necessary in STEMI. In this case, the patient's artery is only mildly blocked, so PCI is not necessary.

 34%|███▍      | 520/1525 [2:08:28<4:25:27, 15.85s/it]The correct answer is C. Oral metastasis.

The patient is a 59-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. She had developed a recurrence for which she had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. She also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and she was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant.

Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion. The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm. Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor. Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is oral metastasis of her endometrial cancer. The patient's history of endometrial cancer, her recent recurrence, and the presence of an infiltrative tumor in the oral cavity with positive staining for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1 are all highly suggestive of metastasis.

Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that is typically seen in children and young adults. It is characterized by a rapidly growing, red, friable mass that often bleeds easily. Gingival/periodontal abscess is a localized infection of the gums and supporting tissues. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and redness of the gums. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the squamous epithelium. It is the most common type of oral cancer.

The patient's history and presentation are not consistent with pyogenic granuloma or gingival/periodontal abscess. Squamous cell carcinoma is a possibility, but the patient's history and presentation are more suggestive of metastasis.

Diphtheria is an acute, potentially life-threatening infectious disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The disease is characterized by the formation of a thick, gray pseudomembrane in the throat. The patient in this case did not have a pseudomembrane, so diphtheria is not the correct diagnosis.

Mononucleosis is an acute viral infection caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The disease is characterized by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The patient in this case had a sore throat, but did not have fever, lymphadenopathy, or fatigue. Additionally, EBV is a blood-borne virus, and is not typically transmitted through the respiratory route. Therefore, mononucleosis is not the correct diagnosis.

Pharyngeal gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The disease is characterized by a sore throat, fever, and discharge from the penis or vagina. The patient in this case had a sore throat, but did not have fever or discharge from the penis or vagina. Additionally, pharyngeal gonorrhea is typically transmitted through sexual contact, and is not typically transmitted through the respiratory route. Therefore, pharyngeal gonorrhea is not the correct diagnosis.

HSV-2 pharyngitis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The disease is characterized by a sore throat, fever, and ulcers in the throat. The patient in this case had a sore throat, fever, and ulcers in the throat. Additionally, HSV-2 is typically transmitted through sexual contact, and is not typically transmitted through the respiratory route. Therefore, HSV-2 pharyngitis is the correct diagnosis.

Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, sinuses, skin, and other organs. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had a kidney transplant.

The patient in the case presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. These symptoms are consistent with aspergillosis. Additionally, the patient had a history of end-stage renal disease and had had a kidney transplant 9 months previously. This puts her at increased risk for developing aspergillosis.

The flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis, posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea. These findings are consistent with aspergillosis.

The computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. These findings are also consistent with aspergillosis.

The biopsy results showed branching organisms superficial to squamous epithelium. This is a characteristic finding of aspergillosis.

Based on the patient's history, presentation, and imaging and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is aspergillosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a type of cancer that can develop in people who have had a transplant. It is not a common cause of airway obstruction.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the lungs. It is not a common cause of airway obstruction.

A hamartoma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor that is made up of normal tissue that is not in its usual location. Hamartomas can occur in any part of the body, but they are most common in the brain, skin, and gastrointestinal tract.

Nasal cavity hamartomas are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all nasal tumors. They are most common in children and young adults, but they can occur at any age.

The exact cause of nasal cavity hamartomas is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Nasal cavity hamartomas are usually asymptomatic (do not cause any symptoms). However, they can sometimes cause nasal obstruction, bleeding, or discharge.

The diagnosis of nasal cavity hamartoma is usually made based on the results of a physical examination, nasal endoscopy, and imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Treatment of nasal cavity hamartomas is usually not necessary, as they are usually benign and do not cause any symptoms. However, if the tumor is causing symptoms, it may be removed surgically.

The prognosis for patients with nasal cavity hamartomas is excellent. The tumors are usually benign and do not recur after they are removed.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of Duane syndrome type III. Duane syndrome is a congenital disorder of eye movement characterized by limitation of abduction or adduction of one eye. The limitation is typically incomitant, meaning that it is worse in certain gaze positions. Duane syndrome is often associated with other ocular abnormalities, such as strabismus, nystagmus, and ptosis.

Carbamazepine is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar disorder. It is also used off-label to treat Duane syndrome. Carbamazepine works by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons. This action stabilizes neuronal membranes and reduces the firing of neurons.

In a study of 18 patients with Duane syndrome, carbamazepine was found to be effective in improving abduction in 13 patients (72%). The improvement was sustained for up to 2 years. Carbamazepine was also found to be safe and well-tolerated.

Bilateral lateral rectus recessions are a surgical procedure that is used to correct strabismus. The procedure involves detaching the lateral rectus muscle from the sclera (the white of the eye) and then reattaching it further back. This action weakens the lateral rectus muscle and allows the eye to move more medially (toward the nose).

Bilateral lateral rectus recessions are not an appropriate treatment for Duane syndrome because they would not address the underlying cause of the condition, which is a problem with the nerves that control eye movement.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic test that is used to visualize the brain and spinal cord. MRI can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis.

MRI is not an appropriate test for Duane syndrome because it is not a structural abnormality. Duane syndrome is a functional abnormality, meaning that it is caused by a problem with the way that the brain controls eye movement.

Anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies are antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors on the surface of neurons. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the control of muscle movement.

Anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies are found in the blood of patients with myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes muscle weakness. Myasthenia gravis is not a likely diagnosis in this patient because she does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of the condition, such as ptosis, diplopia, and fatigue.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A: Initiate a trial of carbamazepine.

The patient has a large, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus. This is concerning for a vascular malformation, such as a hemangioma or lymphangioma. These lesions can be associated with other vascular malformations in the brain and orbits, so it is important to obtain imaging of these areas to rule out any associated lesions.

B. Complete an excisional biopsy of the lesion is not the correct answer because this would not provide any information about whether the lesion is associated with other vascular malformations in the brain and orbits.

C. Complete needle drainage of the lesion is not the correct answer because this would not provide any information about the nature of the lesion or whether it is associated with other vascular malformations in the brain and orbits.

D. Initiate systemic propranolol is not the correct answer because this is a medication that is used to treat hemangiomas, but it is not effective in treating lymphangiomas.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This is the best way to rule out any associated vascular malformations in the brain and orbits.

A. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that uses a light-activated drug to destroy abnormal cells in the eye. It is not effective for choroidal masses, which are located in the back of the eye.

C. Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy injections are a treatment that uses drugs to block the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. They are not effective for choroidal masses, which do not grow new blood vessels.

D. External beam radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high-energy rays to destroy abnormal cells in the eye. It is not effective for choroidal masses, which are located in the back of the eye and are difficult to reach with radiation.

Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is a treatment that uses a radioactive source to destroy abnormal cells in the eye. The radioactive source is placed in a small plaque that is implanted in the eye. The plaque is left in place for a few days, and then it is removed. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is a very effective treatment for choroidal masses. It is safe and well-tolerated, and it can preserve vision in many cases.

In the case of the adolescent boy with choroidal mass, the best treatment option is iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy. This treatment is safe and effective, and it has the potential to preserve his vision.

 35%|███▍      | 527/1525 [2:10:12<3:49:51, 13.82s/it]The correct answer is B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain/orbits.

The patient has optic nerve cupping and visual field deficits, which are suggestive of glaucoma. However, he also has a history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is a genetic disorder that can cause optic neuropathy. In addition, he has episodes of hand tremors, ataxia, and dysarthria, which are symptoms of neurological disease.

The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for a possible underlying neurological disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbits is the best test to evaluate for this possibility. MRI can detect structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors, stroke, or demyelinating disease. It can also assess the optic nerves for signs of inflammation or demyelination.

If the MRI is normal, then the patient's visual field deficits may be due to glaucoma. In this case, the patient should be treated with medications to lower intraocular pressure. However, if the MRI shows an underlying neurological disorder, then the patient will need to be treated for that condition.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide adequate information to make a diagnosis. Observation is not an appropriate management strategy for a patient with visual field deficits. Referral to endocrinology is appropriate if the patient has a history of thyroid disease or other endocrine disorders. However, the patient's history and examination findings do not suggest that he has an endocrine disorder. Repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month is also not an appropriate management strategy. The patient's visual field deficits are progressive, so they need to be evaluated and treated as soon as possible.

The patient has a severe aortic regurgitation, which is a condition in which the aortic valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left ventricle during systole. This can lead to left ventricular failure, pulmonary edema, and death. The only definitive treatment for aortic regurgitation is aortic valve replacement.

A. Order diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms is incorrect because it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Furosemide is a diuretic that would help to reduce the patient's fluid overload, but it would not improve the function of the aortic valve. Serial echocardiograms would be useful to monitor the patient's condition, but they would not be a substitute for definitive treatment.

C. Place an intra-aortic balloon pump is incorrect because it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. An intra-aortic balloon pump is a device that is inserted into the aorta and helps to improve the function of the left ventricle. However, it would not improve the function of the aortic valve.

D. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe is incorrect because it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Antibiotics would be useful to treat any infection that may be causing the aortic regurgitation, but they would not improve the function of the aortic valve. The patient would need to undergo aortic valve replacement to correct the underlying problem.

 35%|███▍      | 529/1525 [2:10:35<3:27:00, 12.47s/it]The correct answer is B. Scleromyxedema.

Scleromyxedema is a rare, chronic, progressive, and debilitating skin disease characterized by diffuse thickening and induration of the skin, as well as mucin deposition in the dermis. It is associated with a monoclonal gammopathy, most commonly IgG λ.

The patient in the case presented with a history of diffuse skin-colored to pink papules coalescing into plaques on the entire face, with exaggerated skin folds of the forehead, glabella, periocular regions, and superior cutaneous lip. This was accompanied by swelling and erythema of both ears. On his extremities and trunk, he had diffuse infiltration of the skin, with exaggerated skin folds, decreased finger flexion, and four-fifths grip strength. His nailfold capillaries were normal. Skin sensation was intact.

The laboratory results were notable for a normal level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, macrocytic anemia, normal creatinine and calcium levels, and a monoclonal spike on a serum protein electrophoresis test. Serum free light chains revealed normal κ free light chains, λ free light chains, and a normal κ/λ ratio. Immunofixation results revealed IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy. A punch biopsy was obtained for diagnostic clarification, which revealed fibroblastic proliferation from the papillary to the reticular dermis, as well as mucin deposition in the reticular dermis.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of scleromyxedema. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

* Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides [MF]) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. It is characterized by the presence of small, red, scaly patches on the skin. These patches can enlarge and coalesce to form plaques or tumors. Mycosis fungoides is not associated with a monoclonal gammopathy.
* Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic, progressive, and disabling disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by the development of skin lesions, nerve damage, and deformities. Lepromatous leprosy is not associated with a monoclonal gammopathy.

Stucco keratoses are small, asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic papules that are often found on the palms and soles. They are typically less than 1 mm in diameter and are usually brown or black in color. They are thought to be caused by chronic friction or trauma.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis is a chronic, progressive skin disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple, small, hyperkeratotic papules on sun-exposed areas of the skin. The papules are typically 2-5 mm in diameter and are often brown or black in color. They may be surrounded by a halo of erythema. The condition is caused by a mutation in the EVER1 gene, which is involved in the production of keratin.

Kyrle disease is a rare, genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple, warty papules on the skin. The papules are typically 1-2 cm in diameter and are often brown or black in color. They may be associated with pain, itching, and tenderness. The condition is caused by a mutation in the MYH9 gene, which is involved in the production of myosin.

The patient in the case presented with a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on his left leg. The eruption consisted of reddish brown hyperkeratotic papules 1 to 10 mm wide. The papules were located on the front and back of the left leg from knee to ankle. The rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. Removal of the scales caused slight bleeding. A lesional skin biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed compact hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, and bandlike lymphocyte infiltrate in the superficial dermis.

The clinical presentation, histopathology, and lack of a family history are consistent with a diagnosis of hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans. Stucco keratoses, disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis, and Kyrle disease are all characterized by the development of hyperkeratotic papules, but they differ in their clinical presentation, histopathology, and genetic basis. Therefore, they are not the correct diagnoses in this case.

A. Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary muscle jerk that can affect any part of the body. It is usually caused by a neurological disorder, such as epilepsy or a brain injury. Myoclonus is not typically associated with speech difficulties, dizziness, or sustained contractions of the face, arm, and leg.

B. Paroxysmal dyskinesia is a neurological disorder that causes sudden, involuntary movements of the body. It is typically caused by a medication side effect or a neurological disorder, such as multiple sclerosis. Paroxysmal dyskinesia is not typically associated with speech difficulties, dizziness, or sustained contractions of the face, arm, and leg.

C. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are a rare type of epilepsy that causes involuntary contractions of the face, arm, and leg. They are typically associated with speech difficulties, dizziness, and sustained contractions of the face, arm, and leg.

D. Tic disorder is a neurological disorder that causes involuntary, repetitive movements or vocalizations. Tics are typically mild and do not cause significant impairment. Tic disorder is not typically associated with speech difficulties, dizziness, or sustained contractions of the face, arm, and leg.

 35%|███▍      | 532/1525 [2:11:17<3:33:01, 12.87s/it]The correct answer is D. Order cerebral angiography.

The patient has a history of left sphenoid wing meningioma involving the left optic nerve and cavernous sinus status postsurgical debulking (2009), radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide followed by intravenous bevacizumab. The patient's current presentation with 2 months of eye redness and decreased vision in her right eye, which was previously diagnosed as viral conjunctivitis and treated with topical prednisolone acetate without improvement, is concerning for recurrent meningioma.

Cerebral angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing meningioma. It can be used to assess the size and location of the tumor, as well as to identify any associated vascular abnormalities. In this case, cerebral angiography would be the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of the patient's eye symptoms.

A. Perform an intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. It can cause redness, pain, and decreased vision. However, the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with uveitis.

B. Start systemic corticosteroids is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an inflammatory condition. Corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammatory conditions, such as uveitis. However, the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with an inflammatory condition.

C. Obtain laboratory workup for uveitis is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with uveitis. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. However, the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with uveitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Order cerebral angiography.

 35%|███▍      | 533/1525 [2:11:33<3:53:05, 14.10s/it]A computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast is the correct answer because it is the most likely test to identify the underlying cause of the patient's diplopia and ptosis. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a number of possible conditions, including thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, and orbital tumors. A CT scan with contrast can help to distinguish between these conditions and guide further management.

Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune condition that can cause inflammation of the muscles and tissues around the eye. This can lead to double vision, ptosis, and proptosis (bulging of the eyes). A CT scan with contrast can help to identify the presence of inflammation and can also show any associated abnormalities, such as optic nerve compression.

Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles. This can include the muscles that control eye movement, which can lead to double vision. Myasthenia gravis can also cause ptosis. A CT scan with contrast is not typically used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, but it can be helpful to rule out other conditions that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Orbital tumors can also cause double vision and ptosis. A CT scan with contrast can help to identify the location and size of the tumor, as well as any associated abnormalities, such as optic nerve compression.

In conclusion, a CT scan with contrast is the most likely test to identify the underlying cause of the patient's diplopia and ptosis. It is important to note that the patient's symptoms are consistent with a number of possible conditions, and further testing may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.

A. Local therapy with 5-fluorouracil is not the best option because it is not effective in treating corneal masses. This type of therapy is typically used to treat superficial corneal lesions, such as those caused by herpes simplex virus. In this case, the lesion is deep and has intrinsic and feeder vessels, which suggests that it is a more aggressive tumor.

B. Incisional biopsy is not the best option because it does not allow for complete removal of the lesion. This type of biopsy involves taking a small piece of tissue from the lesion for analysis. While this can provide information about the type of tumor, it does not remove the entire lesion, which could leave the patient at risk of recurrence.

D. Observe is not the best option because the lesion is large and aggressive. This type of lesion is more likely to spread and become more difficult to treat if it is not removed.

Excisional biopsy is the best option because it allows for complete removal of the lesion. This is the most effective way to treat a corneal mass and prevent it from recurring.

In addition to excisional biopsy, the patient may also need to receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy to prevent the tumor from spreading. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of recurrence.

 35%|███▌      | 535/1525 [2:12:01<3:45:11, 13.65s/it]The correct answer is A. Bleomycin toxic effects.

The patient has a history of Hodgkin lymphoma and is currently receiving chemotherapy with ABVD, which includes bleomycin. Bleomycin is a known cause of skin toxicity, including pruritus, rash, and hyperpigmentation. The patient's rash is consistent with bleomycin toxic effects, as it is linear, hyperpigmented, and developed within 24 hours of starting treatment. The patient's pruritus is also consistent with bleomycin toxicity, as it is diffuse and poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids.

Paraneoplastic skin disease is a rare condition that can occur in patients with cancer. It is characterized by the development of skin lesions that are not directly caused by the cancer itself. The patient's rash is not consistent with paraneoplastic skin disease, as it is not associated with any other symptoms of the condition.

Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is a common skin condition that occurs in pregnant women. It is characterized by the development of a rash on the abdomen, buttocks, and thighs. The patient's rash is not consistent with polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, as it does not occur on the abdomen, buttocks, or thighs.

Vinblastine toxic effects are rare, but can occur in patients receiving chemotherapy with vinblastine. Vinblastine can cause a variety of skin toxicities, including alopecia, rash, and nail changes. The patient's rash is not consistent with vinblastine toxicity, as it is not associated with any other symptoms of the condition.

In conclusion, the patient's rash is most likely due to bleomycin toxic effects.

Kaposi sarcoma is a rare cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is most common in people with HIV/AIDS. The lesions of Kaposi sarcoma are usually purple or brown and can occur anywhere on the body. They are often flat or raised and can be single or multiple. Kaposi sarcoma is not caused by a virus, but by a combination of factors, including HIV infection, age, and certain medications.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that affects B cells, a type of white blood cell. It is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can occur at any age, but is most common in people over 60. The symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma vary depending on the stage of the disease. They may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes.

Leukemia cutis is a rare skin condition that is a form of leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of leukemia cells in the skin. Leukemia cutis can occur in people with all types of leukemia, but it is most common in people with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The symptoms of leukemia cutis vary depending on the type of leukemia. They may include skin lesions, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

The patient in the case presented with multiple erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb, varying in size from 2 × 2 cm to 4 × 4 cm. There was diffuse erythema and edema on the left upper limb, leading to difficulty in limb movement. Multiple dilated superficial vessels were present on the posterior aspect of the left arm and ipsilateral chest wall. Left axillary lymph nodes were grossly enlarged, firm, nontender, and nonmatted, with the largest lymph node measuring 6 × 4 cm. The patient’s CD4 cell count was 141/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), and his HIV load was 504 473 copies/mL. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathologic examination. The biopsy showed infiltration with lymphoid cells and few histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissue. On immunohistochemical analysis, these cells showed nuclear positivity for c-Myc.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of large, rapidly dividing B cells. It is most common in children and young adults, but it can also occur in adults. Burkitt lymphoma is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. The treatment of Burkitt lymphoma typically involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with progressive shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and tachycardia. These are all signs of heart failure. The patient also has hyponatremia, a compensated metabolic acidosis, and a lactate concentration of 82.0 mg/dL. These laboratory findings are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a thiamine deficiency that can occur in people with alcohol abuse.

Wernicke's encephalopathy is a medical emergency and can be fatal if not treated. The treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy is intravenous thiamine therapy. Intravenous thiamine is the most effective way to treat Wernicke's encephalopathy and should be started as soon as possible.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy is a life-support treatment that is used for patients with severe heart failure. It is not necessary for this patient, who has mild heart failure. Administering intravenous β-blocker therapy would not be helpful for this patient, as β-blockers can worsen the symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Administering intravenous bicarbonate therapy would not be helpful for this patient, as the patient does not have a metabolic acidosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Administer intravenous thiamine therapy.

 35%|███▌      | 538/1525 [2:12:37<3:28:52, 12.70s/it]The correct answer is B. Epidermoid cyst.

A simple ranula is a non-neoplastic, fluid-filled lesion that arises from the sublingual gland. It is usually located in the floor of the mouth and is often described as a "frog's belly" appearance. Ranulas are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, if they become large or symptomatic, they may be drained or surgically removed.

A vascular malformation is an abnormal growth of blood vessels. It can be present at birth or develop later in life. Vascular malformations can be classified as hemangiomas or malformations. Hemangiomas are usually benign and resolve on their own over time. Malformations are permanent and may require treatment.

An odontogenic abscess is a localized infection of the tissues around a tooth. It is usually caused by bacteria that enter the tooth through a cavity or gum infection. Odontogenic abscesses can be painful and may cause swelling, redness, and fever. Treatment usually involves draining the abscess and taking antibiotics.

In the case of the woman in her 30s, the mass was soft, mobile, and compressible. It was also located in the midline of the neck, which is consistent with an epidermoid cyst. Epidermoid cysts are the most common type of cyst in the head and neck region. They are typically benign and do not require treatment unless they become large or symptomatic.

The CT scan of the neck showed a well-defined, cystic mass with smooth borders. This is also consistent with an epidermoid cyst. Vascular malformations and odontogenic abscesses would typically have more irregular borders.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Epidermoid cyst.

The patient's history of chronic sinusitis and cocaine use is consistent with cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion. Cocaine use can cause vasoconstriction, which can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the nasal mucosa. This can progress to a destructive lesion that can involve the nasal septum, turbinates, and other structures in the midline of the face.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the sinuses. However, it is not typically associated with cocaine use.

Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type is a rare type of lymphoma that can occur in the nasal cavity. It is not typically associated with cocaine use.

Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is a fungal infection of the sinuses. It is not typically associated with cocaine use.

In conclusion, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion. The other choices are less likely diagnoses.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of rat-bite fever, which is a bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected rat. The most common symptoms of rat-bite fever are fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. The rash typically starts on the hands and feet and then spreads to the rest of the body. In some cases, the rash can become pustular. Other possible symptoms include joint pain, lymphadenopathy, and conjunctivitis.

The diagnosis of rat-bite fever is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The most important laboratory test is a blood culture, which can be used to identify the bacteria that cause rat-bite fever. Other laboratory tests that may be helpful include a complete blood count (CBC), a blood chemistry panel, and a urinalysis.

The treatment for rat-bite fever is antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics are penicillin and doxycycline. Treatment is usually given for 7 to 10 days.

The prognosis for rat-bite fever is generally good. Most patients recover completely with treatment. However, some patients may experience complications, such as meningitis, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

B. Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of joint infection. The patient's white blood cell count is normal, and there is no evidence of inflammation in the joint fluid.

C. Test for Borrelia burgdorferi is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. However, the patient's rash is not consistent with Lyme disease, and there is no evidence of tick bites.

D. Test vesicular fluid for enterovirus is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of enterovirus infection. Enterovirus infections are a common cause of viral meningitis and encephalitis. However, the patient does not have any symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis, and there is no evidence of vesicular lesions.

A core needle biopsy is a procedure that uses a needle to remove a small piece of tissue from a tumor. This tissue is then examined under a microscope to determine if the tumor is cancerous.

An incisional biopsy is a procedure that involves making a small incision in the skin and removing a larger piece of tissue from the tumor. This procedure is more invasive than a core needle biopsy, but it allows the doctor to obtain a larger sample of tissue, which may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

Simple excision of the lesion is a procedure that involves removing the entire tumor. This procedure is usually reserved for tumors that are small and benign.

Repeat imaging in 6 months is not the correct answer because the patient has a large, enlarging, immobile, painless mass in her right gluteal area. This mass is concerning for malignancy, and further evaluation is necessary.

A core needle biopsy is the best option in this case because it is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the doctor to obtain a sample of tissue for diagnosis. If the biopsy shows that the tumor is cancerous, further treatment can be planned.

Bullous Wells syndrome is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the sudden onset of tense blisters and bullae on the skin. The blisters are often preceded by fever, malaise, and arthralgia. The lesions are typically found on the trunk and extremities, but can occur anywhere on the body. The blisters are usually self-limited, but they can be recurrent.

The diagnosis of bullous Wells syndrome is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows a characteristic pattern of subepidermal blistering with a lymphocytic infiltrate.

There is no specific treatment for bullous Wells syndrome. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing the recurrence of lesions. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's presentation.

A. Famciclovir-resistant disseminated herpes zoster is a rare, but serious, complication of herpes zoster. It is characterized by the spread of the herpes zoster virus to the skin and other organs. The patient in this case does not have any of the features of famciclovir-resistant disseminated herpes zoster, such as fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy.

B. Bullous Sweet syndrome is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the sudden onset of painful, erythematous plaques and bullae on the skin. The lesions are often preceded by fever, malaise, and arthralgia. The patient in this case does not have any of the features of bullous Sweet syndrome, such as fever, malaise, or arthralgia.

D. Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic, autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the formation of tense blisters and bullae on the skin. The blisters are often preceded by itching and a burning sensation. The patient in this case does not have any of the features of bullous pemphigoid, such as itching or a burning sensation.

A cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare type of skin cancer that usually occurs in people who have been exposed to radiation. It is characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the skin. Radiation dermatitis is a condition that can occur after radiation therapy to the skin. It is characterized by redness, swelling, and flaking of the skin. A Wolf isotopic response is a rare reaction to radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the development of a rash on the face and neck.

In this case, the patient has a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the skin. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma. The biopsy results also confirm the diagnosis.

Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare diagnosis, and it is important to consider other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. However, the patient's history, physical examination findings, and biopsy results all support the diagnosis of telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma.

The following are the reasons why the other answer choices are incorrect:

* A. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare type of skin cancer that usually occurs in people who have been exposed to radiation. It is characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the skin. The patient in this case does not have a history of radiation exposure, and her physical examination findings are not consistent with cutaneous angiosarcoma.
* B. Radiation dermatitis is a condition that can occur after radiation therapy to the skin. It is characterized by redness, swelling, and flaking of the skin. The patient in this case does not have a history of radiation therapy, and her physical examination findings are not consistent with radiation dermatitis.
* C. A Wolf isotopic response is a rare reaction to radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the development of a rash on the face and neck. The patient in this case does not have a history of hyperthyroidism, and her physical examination findings are not consistent with a Wolf isotopic response.

The patient has a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic pPTLD. He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with pPTLD. pPTLD is a rare but serious complication of organ transplantation, occurring in 1-5% of patients. It is a clonal proliferation of B cells or T cells that occurs in the setting of chronic immunosuppression. The most common clinical presentation is a mass lesion in the allograft, but it can also present as skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, or gastrointestinal involvement. The diagnosis of pPTLD is made by biopsy, which shows a clonal proliferation of lymphocytes with features of malignancy. Treatment of pPTLD is based on the stage of the disease. Early-stage disease can be treated with reduction in immunosuppression or chemotherapy. Late-stage disease requires more aggressive treatment, such as high-dose chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Reactive granulomatous disorder is a non-neoplastic condition that can occur in the setting of chronic inflammation. It is characterized by a granulomatous infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelioid cells. The clinical presentation and histopathology of reactive granulomatous disorder are not consistent with the patient's presentation.
* C. Deep fungal infection is a rare but serious complication of organ transplantation. It can occur in the setting of chronic immunosuppression or as a result of infection with a resistant organism. The clinical presentation of deep fungal infection can vary depending on the organism involved, but it often includes fever, chills, and weight loss. The histopathology of deep fungal infection shows a suppurative or granulomatous infiltrate with fungal elements. The patient's clinical presentation and histopathology are not consistent with deep fungal infection.
* D. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can occur in the skin. It is characterized by a clonal proliferation of T cells in the skin. The clinical presentation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can vary depending on the subtype, but it often includes skin lesions, such as papules, plaques, or tumors. The histopathology of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma shows a clonal proliferation of T cells with features of malignancy. The patient's clinical presentation and histopathology are not consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

 36%|███▌      | 545/1525 [2:14:18<3:52:22, 14.23s/it]The correct diagnosis is C. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). This is a hereditary disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, causing progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles in the hands and feet. It is the most common inherited neurological disorder, affecting about 1 in 2,500 people.

The patient in the case report has several features that are consistent with CMT, including:

* A longstanding history of gait imbalance
* Two episodes of acute-onset left hemibody weakness and dysarthria
* Mild-to-moderate dysarthria
* Pes planovalgus and tight achilles tendons bilaterally
* Decreased vibratory and fine touch sensation from the great toe up to the mid shin bilaterally
* Absent reflexes at the patella and achilles bilaterally
* Bilateral dorsiflexion weakness (4 of 5)
* No motor deficits, muscle atrophy, or lateralizing neurologic abnormalities
* Normal results on a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a coagulation panel
* No evidence of extra or intracranial dissection on computed tomography angiogram
* Symmetric, bilateral, restricted diffusion, with T2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter and corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
* Normal cell counts and no oligoclonal bands or evidence of infection on lumbar puncture

The patient's family history is also consistent with CMT. His mother has diminished reflexes, hand tremor, and balance issues, and his younger brother has similar gait abnormalities.

Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) is a genetic disorder that affects the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing cells in the body. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including stroke-like episodes, seizures, lactic acidosis, and developmental delay. MELAS is not typically associated with gait abnormalities or a family history of the disorder.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the myelin sheaths that protect nerve fibers. It can cause progressive weakness, spasticity, and seizures. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is not typically associated with gait abnormalities or a family history of the disorder.

Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, vision problems, numbness, and weakness. MS is not typically associated with gait abnormalities or a family history of the disorder.

In conclusion, the patient in the case report most likely has X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This is a hereditary disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, causing progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles in the hands and feet. It is the most common inherited neurological disorder, affecting about 1 in 2,500 people. The patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory findings are all consistent with CMT.

 36%|███▌      | 546/1525 [2:14:33<3:56:43, 14.51s/it]The correct answer is D. Initiate intravenous penicillin therapy.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with neurosyphilis, which is a late manifestation of syphilis that can cause inflammation of the optic nerve and retina. The fluorescein angiography findings are also consistent with neurosyphilis.

Treatment for neurosyphilis is with intravenous penicillin G for 10-14 days. Oral prednisone or other immunosuppressive medications are not indicated for the treatment of neurosyphilis. Antiviral therapy is not indicated for neurosyphilis, as it is caused by a bacterial infection, not a viral infection.

Bilateral posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injections are not indicated for the treatment of neurosyphilis. They may be used to treat uveitis, which is inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. However, uveitis is not a feature of neurosyphilis.

Increasing the dose of oral prednisone is not indicated for the treatment of neurosyphilis. Oral prednisone may be used to treat inflammation, but it is not effective against the bacteria that cause neurosyphilis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Initiate intravenous penicillin therapy.
It is reasoning
 36%|███▌      | 547/1525 [2:14:49<4:05:06, 15.04s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography.

The patient has bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. She has a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition has been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure is 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes. No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. Her anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no remarkable abnormalities except for partially empty sella. She had normal blood pressure levels. Results of laboratory testing regarding systemic infection were negative, and her serum D-dimer level was normal.

The differential diagnosis for papilledema includes:

* Increased intracranial pressure
* Ischemic optic neuropathy
* Optic neuritis
* Central retinal vein occlusion
* Giant cell arteritis
* Malignant hypertension
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage

In this case, the patient's history of Behçet disease and the presence of papilledema make increased intracranial pressure the most likely diagnosis. The partially empty sella on magnetic resonance imaging is a non-specific finding that is not associated with increased intracranial pressure.

The next step in management is to obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography to rule out a venous sinus thrombosis. A venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but serious complication of Behçet disease that can lead to blindness.

If the cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography is normal, the next step is to obtain a lumbar puncture to measure the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. If the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is elevated, the patient should be treated with a corticosteroid such as prednisone.

If the cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography shows a venous sinus thrombosis, the patient should be treated with anticoagulation with a low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin.

A. Add immunosuppressant to corticosteroid therapy is incorrect because the patient is already receiving thalidomide, which is an immunosuppressant.

B. Increase the prednisone dose is incorrect because the patient has already been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement.

D. Perform catheter cerebral angiography is incorrect because this is an invasive procedure that is not necessary in this case.

 36%|███▌      | 548/1525 [2:15:02<3:56:34, 14.53s/it]The correct answer is A. Obtain a family medical history and genetic testing.

The patient in this case has bilateral atypical epiretinal membranes (ERMs). ERMs are a common cause of visual impairment in older adults, but they are rare in children. In children, ERMs are often associated with other ocular or systemic conditions, such as Stickler syndrome, Wagner syndrome, and Marfan syndrome.

The patient in this case has no history of any of these conditions, but it is still important to obtain a family medical history and genetic testing to rule out any underlying causes. If the patient does have a genetic condition, early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent or slow the progression of the disease.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management options for a child with bilateral atypical ERMs. Option B, pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel, is a surgical procedure that is typically used to treat ERMs in adults. However, this procedure is not recommended for children, as it can damage the retina and lead to further visual impairment. Option C, observing the lesions, is also not a good option, as ERMs can progress and cause further visual impairment. Option D, giving an intravitreal ocriplasmin injection, is a new treatment option for ERMs. However, this treatment is not yet approved for use in children.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Obtain a family medical history and genetic testing. This is the most appropriate management option for a child with bilateral atypical ERMs.

 36%|███▌      | 549/1525 [2:15:19<4:05:35, 15.10s/it]The correct answer is B. Conjunctival biopsy.

The patient has a conjunctival lesion that is solid, superior bulbar, and measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lesion is noncompressible on B-scan ultrasonography and shows nonspecific, increased soft-tissue density on computed tomography scan. These findings are concerning for a malignancy. A conjunctival biopsy is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

Topical corticosteroid eyedrops would not be the correct next step because they would not provide a definitive diagnosis. They may be used to treat inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva, but they would not be effective in treating a malignancy.

Complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests are not indicated in this case. These tests would not provide any information about the conjunctival lesion.

Serum and urine electrophoresis is not indicated in this case. These tests are used to diagnose and monitor hematologic disorders, but they would not be helpful in diagnosing a conjunctival lesion.

In conclusion, the correct next step in the management of this patient is to perform a conjunctival biopsy. This will provide a definitive diagnosis and allow for appropriate treatment of the lesion.

 36%|███▌      | 550/1525 [2:15:27<3:31:06, 12.99s/it]The correct answer is D: Obtain serum vitamin A levels.

The patient is a middle-aged man with a history of alcoholism and a nonhealing corneal ulcer. He has no known medical diagnoses, but his social history is notable for consumption of approximately 12 alcoholic beverages per day. Alcoholism is a risk factor for malnutrition, including vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of epithelial tissues, including the cornea. A deficiency of vitamin A can lead to keratinization of the corneal epithelium, which can make the cornea more susceptible to infection and delayed healing.

The patient's corneal ulcer has not responded to topical moxifloxacin, which suggests that it may be caused by an organism that is resistant to this antibiotic. It is also possible that the ulcer is caused by a combination of organisms, including bacteria and fungi. In order to identify the causative organism(s) and to select the appropriate antibiotic therapy, it is important to obtain cultures of the ulcer.

In addition to cultures, it is also important to obtain serum vitamin A levels. A low serum vitamin A level would support the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency as a contributing factor to the patient's corneal ulcer. If the patient is found to be vitamin A deficient, he will need to receive oral vitamin A supplements in order to correct the deficiency and promote healing of the corneal ulcer.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Confocal microscopy is a technique that can be used to visualize the corneal epithelium in detail. However, it is not necessary to obtain confocal microscopy images in order to diagnose or treat a corneal ulcer.
* Obtaining herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests is only necessary if there is a suspicion that the corneal ulcer is caused by herpes simplex virus. The patient's history and clinical presentation do not suggest that herpes simplex virus is the cause of his ulcer.
* Broadening antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and tobramycin is only necessary if there is a suspicion that the corneal ulcer is caused by a resistant organism. The patient's cultures have not yet grown any organisms, so it is premature to broaden antibiotic coverage at this time.

Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. It is most common in the elderly and is more likely to occur in people who have been exposed to radiation. Angiosarcoma does not typically occur in people who have a history of radiation therapy for other cancers.

Leukemia cutis is a type of leukemia that affects the skin. It is most common in children and young adults. Leukemia cutis is not typically associated with a history of radiation therapy.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells. It is the second most common type of skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is more likely to occur in people who have a history of sun exposure.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It starts in the basal cells, which are the cells that produce new skin cells. Basal cell carcinoma is most common in people who have a history of sun exposure.

The patient in the case presented with numerous pink and brown papules and plaques, some with ulceration, on the head and along the midline of the neck and spine. The patient also had a history of radiation therapy for medulloblastoma and meningioma. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. It is most common in the elderly and is more likely to occur in people who have been exposed to radiation.

A. Disease progression is incorrect because the patient's condition improved after she started nivolumab therapy.

C. Cold panniculitis is incorrect because the patient did not have any recent cold exposure.

D. Erythema nodosum under nivolumab is incorrect because the patient did not have any of the typical symptoms of erythema nodosum, such as fever, arthralgia, and malaise.

Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis is a rare but well-described adverse event of nivolumab therapy. It is characterized by painful, erythematous, and indurated skin lesions that often occur on the extremities. The lesions are typically associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate on biopsy. The condition is usually self-limiting, but it can be treated with steroids or other immunosuppressive agents.

In the case of the patient in the question, the diagnosis of nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient developed the skin lesions after starting nivolumab therapy.
* The lesions are located on the extremities, which is a common site for nivolumab-induced panniculitis.
* The lesions are painful, erythematous, and indurated, which are typical features of nivolumab-induced panniculitis.
* The biopsy specimen showed a lymphocytic infiltrate, which is a characteristic finding of nivolumab-induced panniculitis.

 36%|███▋      | 553/1525 [2:16:16<4:07:11, 15.26s/it]The correct answer is B: Start intravenous heparin.

The patient has a mechanical mitral valve, which means that it is made of artificial materials. Mechanical valves are more prone to blood clots than natural valves. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic, which means that her blood is not clotting properly. This puts her at increased risk for a blood clot forming on the mitral valve.

A blood clot on a mechanical valve can cause the valve to become blocked, which can prevent blood from flowing through the heart properly. This can lead to heart failure and death.

Heparin is a blood thinner that can help to prevent blood clots from forming. It is the first-line treatment for patients with mechanical valves who have a subtherapeutic INR.

Starting intravenous heparin is the most appropriate treatment for this patient because it will help to prevent a blood clot from forming on the mitral valve. This will help to protect the patient from heart failure and death.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Refer the patient for aortic root dissection repair. This is not the correct treatment for a patient with a blood clot on a mechanical valve. Aortic root dissection repair is a surgical procedure that is used to repair an aortic dissection. It is not indicated for the treatment of a blood clot on a mechanical valve.
* Option C: Administer a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). tPA is a thrombolytic agent that is used to dissolve blood clots. It is not indicated for the treatment of a blood clot on a mechanical valve. tPA can cause bleeding, and it is contraindicated in patients with mechanical valves.
* Option D: Perform emergency percutaneous clot removal. This is not the correct treatment for a patient with a blood clot on a mechanical valve. Percutaneous clot removal is a procedure that is used to remove blood clots from arteries. It is not indicated for the treatment of blood clots on mechanical valves.

A Pott puffy tumor is a benign soft tissue mass that occurs in the frontal bone. It is caused by a chronic infection of the frontal sinuses. The mass is typically non-tender and non-mobile. It is not associated with bony destruction or air pockets.

A mucocele is a benign cystic lesion that occurs in the sinuses. It is caused by obstruction of the sinus drainage pathway. The mass is typically soft and fluctuant. It is not associated with bony destruction or air pockets.

Basal cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer. It typically occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face. The mass is typically small, raised, and well-defined. It is not associated with bony destruction or air pockets.

Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that originates in the sebaceous glands. It typically occurs on the head and neck. The mass is typically large, irregular, and poorly defined. It is associated with bony destruction and air pockets.

In the case presented, the patient has a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus. It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma.

The differential diagnosis for a large, right supraorbital mass includes Pott puffy tumor, mucocele, basal cell carcinoma, and sebaceous carcinoma. However, the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological findings in this case are most consistent with a diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma.

 36%|███▋      | 555/1525 [2:16:46<4:07:27, 15.31s/it]The correct answer is D. Schistosomiasis. The patient's history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika, a known risk factor for schistosomiasis, as well as the clinical presentation of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo, are consistent with a diagnosis of schistosomiasis. The imaging findings of a hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve are also consistent with schistosomiasis.

Prostate cancer with brain metastasis is a less likely diagnosis. The patient's history of urinary frequency is more likely due to schistosomiasis than prostate cancer. The imaging findings of a prostatic lesion are not specific for prostate cancer, and could be due to other conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis.

Tuberculosis is also a less likely diagnosis. The patient's history does not suggest a risk factor for tuberculosis, and the clinical presentation of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo is not typical of tuberculosis. The imaging findings of a hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve are also not specific for tuberculosis.

Toxoplasmosis is also a less likely diagnosis. The patient's history does not suggest a risk factor for toxoplasmosis, and the clinical presentation of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo is not typical of toxoplasmosis. The imaging findings of a hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve are also not specific for toxoplasmosis.

Lupus vulgaris is a chronic, progressive form of cutaneous tuberculosis that most commonly affects the skin of the head and neck. It is characterized by the formation of verrucous plaques with central ulceration and scarring. The lesions are often associated with regional lymphadenopathy.

The histopathological features of lupus vulgaris are characteristic and include granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain may show acid-fast bacilli.

The diagnosis of lupus vulgaris is based on the clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and response to treatment. The treatment of choice is a combination of antituberculous drugs and surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect because they do not present with the characteristic clinical features of lupus vulgaris.

* Fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. It is characterized by the formation of single or multiple nodules or ulcers, usually on the extremities. The lesions are often associated with regional lymphadenopathy.

The patient has a history of pseudogout and kidney transplant 13 years ago. He was taking sirolimus and prednisone, with excellent graft function. His temperature on presentation was 102°F (38.9°C). He had nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig sign. There were no focal neurologic deficits and no spinal tenderness. He had a right knee effusion without erythema and with full range of motion. Laboratory workup of serum showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10 200/μL (neutrophils, 63.8%; lymphocytes, 19.6%; monocytes, 15.1%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 63 mm/h; workup of cerebrospinal fluid showed a WBC count of 0/μL; red blood cell count, 32/μL; total protein level, 109 mg/dL; and glucose level, 59 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow (Figure 1). He was prescribed intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative.

The patient's history and presentation are concerning for an infectious process, such as meningitis or epidural abscess. The patient's fever, nuchal rigidity, and positive Kernig sign are classic findings of meningitis. The patient's right knee effusion could be a result of septic arthritis. The patient's laboratory workup shows an elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which are non-specific findings that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions. The patient's CSF cultures were negative, which makes meningitis less likely. However, the patient's MRI of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow, which could be a sign of an epidural abscess.

The next step in the patient's management should be to obtain additional imaging with computed tomography (CT). CT scan of the spine can help to identify the presence of an epidural abscess, which would require urgent surgical drainage. CT scan of the spine can also help to identify other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a spinal tumor or fracture.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Continue intravenous antibiotics is incorrect because the patient's blood and CSF cultures were negative. Intravenous antibiotics should be discontinued if the patient's cultures are negative to avoid the development of antibiotic resistance.

C. Start gabapentin is incorrect because gabapentin is a medication used to treat neuropathic pain. The patient does not have any symptoms of neuropathic pain.

D. Start high-dose ibuprofen is incorrect because ibuprofen is a medication used to treat pain and inflammation. The patient's symptoms are not likely to be caused by inflammation.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor or other intracranial lesion. An empirical methotrexate prescription is not indicated because the patient does not have rheumatoid arthritis or another autoimmune disease that is treated with methotrexate. An empirical sumatriptan prescription is not indicated because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a migraine headache.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a test that measures the levels of different proteins in the blood. It is often used to diagnose and monitor diseases that affect the blood proteins, such as multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. In this case, SPEP is indicated because the patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated, which suggests that she may have an inflammatory condition. SPEP can help to identify the specific type of inflammatory condition that the patient has.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI is a test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It is often used to diagnose and monitor diseases of the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. In this case, MRI is not indicated because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor or other intracranial lesion.
* Empirical methotrexate prescription: Methotrexate is a medication that is used to treat a variety of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer. It is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any of these diseases.
* Empirical sumatriptan prescription: Sumatriptan is a medication that is used to treat migraine headaches. It is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a migraine headache.

Granulomatous cheilitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lips characterized by the formation of granulomas. Granulomas are small, raised lesions that are formed when the body's immune system responds to an infection or foreign substance. Granulomatous cheilitis is most commonly caused by contact with an irritant, such as a toothpaste or lipstick, but it can also be caused by an infection, such as a fungus or bacteria. The lesions of granulomatous cheilitis are usually red, raised, and tender. They may also be scaly or crusty. Granulomatous cheilitis is typically treated with topical steroids or oral antibiotics.

Lip licker’s dermatitis is a condition that occurs when the skin on the lips becomes irritated from excessive licking. The licking can be caused by a variety of factors, such as dry lips, allergies, or anxiety. The irritation can cause the lips to become red, swollen, and chapped. Lip licker’s dermatitis is usually treated with topical steroid creams or ointments.

Pyostomatitis vegetans is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition of the mouth that is characterized by the formation of painful, ulcerative lesions on the lips, gums, and tongue. The lesions of pyostomatitis vegetans are usually red, raised, and covered with a white or yellow exudate. Pyostomatitis vegetans is a serious condition that can lead to scarring and disfigurement. It is usually treated with a combination of medications, including steroids, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely diagnosis is leukemia labialis. This is because the patient has multiple erythematous and flesh-colored papules and nodules symmetrically affecting the upper and lower lips with extension onto the vermilion border. These lesions are characteristic of leukemia labialis. The patient also denies fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, cough, lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or other systemic symptoms. This is also consistent with leukemia labialis, which is a localized form of leukemia that does not usually cause systemic symptoms. The biopsy of the vermilion lip shows infiltration of the dermis with atypical lymphocytes, which is further evidence of leukemia labialis.

Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, chronic, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder characterized by infiltration of histiocytes, foamy macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, orbit, and other organs. It is a systemic disease that can affect multiple organs, including the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and bones.

The patient in the case presented with a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque, unremitting abdominal and back pain, and CT scan findings of extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space. Sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures were also noted. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was diagnosed following biopsies. Prednisone and azathioprine were started. Biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque returned xanthelasma. Ureteral obstruction, chronic kidney disease, and lymphedema complicated her course. Azathioprine was stopped after 1 year. Prednisone was slowly tapered but she relapsed 3 years later. A second retroperitoneal biopsy exhibited fibroadipose tissue, foamy macrophages, and chronic inflammation with fibrosis. Azathioprine and prednisone were restarted. She required multiple surgeries for spinal stenosis and ureteral obstruction. Her kidney function continued declining. Then, owing to knee pain, a plain radiograph was obtained which demonstrated osteosclerosis of the distal femur. Consequently, the previous eyelid and retroperitoneal biopsies were reviewed. The clinicopathologic presentation was confirmed with a molecular test.

The patient's presentation is consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. The characteristic histopathologic findings of Erdheim-Chester disease include infiltration of histiocytes, foamy macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, orbit, and other organs. The patient's CT scan findings of extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space and sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures are also consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's clinical course, including her relapse after discontinuation of azathioprine, is also consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder characterized by the presence of necrobiotic xanthogranulomas, which are inflammatory lesions composed of foamy macrophages, Touton giant cells, and necrotic collagen. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma typically affects the skin, but it can also involve other organs, such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys. The patient in the case did not have any skin lesions consistent with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.

Xanthelasma palpebrum is a common, benign condition characterized by the deposition of yellow plaques of cholesterol-rich material on the eyelids. Xanthelasma palpebrum is not associated with systemic disease. The patient in the case had a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque, but this plaque was not consistent with xanthelasma palpebrum because it was associated with other systemic symptoms, such as unremitting abdominal and back pain.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. Langerhans cell histiocytosis can affect multiple organs, including the skin, bones, lymph nodes, and liver. The patient in the case did not have any clinical or laboratory findings consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

EPF is a rare, chronic, relapsing, pruritic inflammatory disorder of the hair follicles. It is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple, small, follicular pustules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The pustules are often surrounded by erythematous papules and plaques. The condition is more common in men than in women, and it typically occurs in people of middle age.

The exact cause of EPF is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

There is no cure for EPF, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically involves the use of topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, phototherapy or azathioprine may be used.

The prognosis for EPF is variable. Some people experience complete remission, while others have a chronic, relapsing course. The condition can be very debilitating, and it can have a significant impact on quality of life.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is a rare type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It is characterized by the infiltration of the hair follicles by malignant T cells. The lesions of folliculotropic mycosis fungoides are often pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques. However, they are not typically associated with pustules.
* Papulopustular rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the facial skin. It is characterized by the presence of erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasias. The lesions of papulopustular rosacea are typically found on the central face, including the cheeks, nose, and chin. However, they are not typically associated with pustules.
* Majocchi granuloma is a rare, chronic, granulomatous infection of the hair follicles. It is caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum. The lesions of Majocchi granuloma are typically small, erythematous papules and nodules. They are often found on the legs and feet. However, they are not typically associated with pustules.

It is characterized by the triad of hearing loss, vision loss, and headache. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings, including the presence of hearing loss, vision loss, and headache, as well as imaging studies that show characteristic changes in the brain and eyes. There is no cure for Susac syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve quality of life.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the destruction of the myelin sheath, which protects nerve fibers. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, numbness, tingling, vision problems, and problems with balance and coordination. MS is a progressive disease, meaning that it gets worse over time. There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

Behçet's disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease that affects the blood vessels, skin, joints, and mucous membranes. It is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, as well as uveitis (inflammation of the eye). Behçet's disease is a systemic disease, meaning that it can affect multiple organs and systems in the body. There is no cure for Behçet's disease, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms and prevent complications.

CADASIL is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain. It is characterized by the development of small strokes (infarcts) in the brain, as well as white matter changes. CADASIL can lead to a variety of neurological problems, including memory loss, dementia, and seizures. There is no cure for CADASIL, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

In the case of the 42-year-old woman with transient neurological symptoms, migraine headaches, and hearing loss, the most likely diagnosis is Susac syndrome. This is because she presents with the triad of hearing loss, vision loss, and headache, as well as imaging studies that show characteristic changes in the brain and eyes. The other choices are less likely because they do not explain all of the patient's symptoms.

 37%|███▋      | 563/1525 [2:18:49<4:06:37, 15.38s/it]The correct answer is B: Observe the patient.

The patient in this case has a history of migraine and polycystic ovaries, and she reported a flulike episode 1 week prior to the onset of her visual symptoms. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), which is a rare, self-limiting condition that typically resolves within 1-2 months.

AMN is thought to be caused by a viral infection, and it is often associated with migraine. The symptoms of AMN typically include sudden onset of photopsia (flashing lights), scotoma (blind spots), and decreased vision. The diagnosis of AMN is made based on the patient's history and examination findings, and it can be confirmed with imaging studies such as near-infrared reflectance imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).

There is no specific treatment for AMN, and the condition typically resolves on its own within 1-2 months. However, some patients may experience persistent visual symptoms, such as decreased visual acuity and color vision abnormalities.

In the case of the patient in this question, her symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of AMN. She has a history of migraine, and she reported a flulike episode 1 week prior to the onset of her visual symptoms. Her examination findings are also consistent with AMN, and her near-infrared reflectance imaging and OCT scans show characteristic findings of the condition.

Given the patient's history, examination findings, and imaging studies, the most appropriate management at this time is to observe her. She should be advised to follow up with her doctor in 1-2 weeks to assess her progress. If her symptoms do not improve or worsen, further testing and treatment may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for AMN.

Fluorescein angiography is a test that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It is not necessary in the diagnosis or management of AMN.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is a test that can be used to look for structural abnormalities in the brain. It is not necessary in the diagnosis or management of AMN.

A course of oral corticosteroids is a treatment that can be used to suppress the immune system. It is not necessary in the treatment of AMN.

The patient in the case has a 2-week history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae. These symptoms are consistent with an underlying infection, such as leukemia or a blood dyscrasia. The patient also has retinal hemorrhages, which can be a sign of these conditions.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential is a test that measures the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood. It also measures the percentage of each type of white blood cell. A CBC with differential can help to diagnose an infection, such as leukemia or a blood dyscrasia.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Obtaining a fluorescein angiogram to evaluate degree of ischemia and confirm a diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion would be appropriate if the patient had central retinal vein occlusion. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with central retinal vein occlusion. Providing the patient with stool softeners to prevent recurrence of Valsalva retinopathy would be appropriate if the patient had Valsalva retinopathy. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with Valsalva retinopathy. Immediately beginning intravenous antibiotics before any blood draws and consulting cardiology for likely bacterial endocarditis would be appropriate if the patient had bacterial endocarditis. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with bacterial endocarditis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Draw a complete blood cell count with differential to evaluate for leukemic retinopathy or blood dyscrasia.

The patient has a pigmented conjunctival lesion in the left eye. The referring physician suspected primary acquired melanosis (PAM). PAM is a benign condition, but it can rarely progress to melanoma, a type of cancer. Therefore, it is important to biopsy the lesion to determine if it is malignant.

A referral to an oncologist for metastatic workup is not necessary at this time. The patient does not have any symptoms of metastatic disease, and the lesion is not suspicious for malignancy.

Cryotherapy is a treatment option for PAM, but it is not appropriate in this case. Cryotherapy can damage the cornea, and the patient has already developed some corneal changes.

Oral doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not effective against PAM.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion. This will allow the physician to determine if the lesion is malignant and to recommend appropriate treatment.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* **A. Refer to an oncologist for metastatic workup:** This is not necessary at this time. The patient does not have any symptoms of metastatic disease, and the lesion is not suspicious for malignancy.
* **B. Biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion:** This is the correct answer. The lesion needs to be biopsied to determine if it is malignant.
* **C. Perform cryotherapy over the lesion:** This is not appropriate in this case. Cryotherapy can damage the cornea, and the patient has already developed some corneal changes.
* **D. Start oral doxycycline:** This is not effective against PAM.

 37%|███▋      | 566/1525 [2:19:34<3:56:36, 14.80s/it]The correct answer is C: Proceed with conjunctival biopsy.

The patient has a history of soft contact lens wear and presented with asymptomatic follicular conjunctivitis that has not responded to treatment with topical steroids and antihistamines. He also has a positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic follicular conjunctivitis secondary to an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, such as lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A conjunctival biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose these conditions.

A longer trial of topical steroids and antihistamines is not likely to be effective in this case, as the patient has already been treated with these medications for 3 months without improvement. Starting an empirical trial of oral azithromycin is also not a good option, as this medication is only effective against chlamydia and gonorrhea, which have been ruled out in this patient. Ordering chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test is not necessary, as these tests are not helpful in diagnosing chronic follicular conjunctivitis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to proceed with a conjunctival biopsy. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the underlying condition.

 37%|███▋      | 567/1525 [2:19:47<3:48:07, 14.29s/it]The correct answer is B: Examine the retinal periphery.

The patient in this case has monocular crystalline maculopathy, which is a rare condition characterized by the presence of refractile crystals in the macula. The macula is the central part of the retina, and is responsible for fine vision. The crystals in this condition are usually located on the surface of the inner limiting membrane, which is a thin layer of tissue that separates the retina from the vitreous humor.

The most common cause of monocular crystalline maculopathy is trauma to the eye. Other causes include exposure to certain chemicals, such as heavy metals, and certain medications, such as chloroquine. In some cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.

The symptoms of monocular crystalline maculopathy usually develop gradually over time. The most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include floaters, flashes of light, and a dark spot in the center of vision.

There is no cure for monocular crystalline maculopathy. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing further vision loss. Treatment options may include laser therapy, vitrectomy, or medication.

In the case of the patient in this question, the history and physical examination are not suggestive of any other underlying medical conditions. The fundus examination shows multiple refractile small crystals scattered on the posterior pole, which is consistent with the diagnosis of monocular crystalline maculopathy. The optical coherence tomography of the macula reveals the crystals to be located preretinally on the surface of the inner limiting membrane with sporadic crystals within the cortical vitreous. This finding is also consistent with the diagnosis of monocular crystalline maculopathy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to examine the retinal periphery. This is important because monocular crystalline maculopathy can sometimes cause peripheral retinal tears or detachments. If a peripheral retinal tear or detachment is present, it will need to be treated with laser therapy or surgery to prevent further vision loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Requesting a genetic workup is not necessary in this case because the history and physical examination are not suggestive of any genetic conditions.
* C: Measuring oxalate levels in blood and urine is not necessary in this case because oxalate levels are not typically elevated in patients with monocular crystalline maculopathy.
* D: Screening for intravenous abuse of opioids and other substances is not necessary in this case because there is no history or physical evidence of drug abuse.

 37%|███▋      | 568/1525 [2:20:04<3:58:18, 14.94s/it]The correct answer is D. All of the above. The patient has optic nerve head edema, which is a sign of increased pressure within the optic nerve. This can be caused by a number of things, including hypertension, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. In order to determine the cause of the optic nerve head edema, the patient needs to have a thorough workup, including blood tests, imaging studies, and a lumbar puncture.

Blood tests can be used to check for underlying medical conditions that can cause optic nerve head edema, such as hypertension, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venogram (MRV), can be used to look for structural abnormalities in the brain and orbits that could be causing the optic nerve head edema. A lumbar puncture can be used to test the cerebrospinal fluid for signs of infection or inflammation.

Once the cause of the optic nerve head edema has been determined, the patient can be treated appropriately. For example, if the optic nerve head edema is caused by hypertension, the patient's blood pressure will need to be controlled. If the optic nerve head edema is caused by diabetes, the patient's blood sugar levels will need to be controlled. And if the optic nerve head edema is caused by multiple sclerosis, the patient will need to be treated with medications that suppress the immune system.

It is important to note that optic nerve head edema can also be caused by non-medical conditions, such as trauma to the eye or tumors of the optic nerve. In these cases, the patient may need to undergo surgery to treat the underlying condition.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. All of the above. The patient needs to have a thorough workup, including blood tests, imaging studies, and a lumbar puncture, in order to determine the cause of the optic nerve head edema. Once the cause has been determined, the patient can be treated appropriately.

T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare type of leukemia that affects the white blood cells. It is characterized by an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection.

The symptoms of T-PLL can vary from person to person, but they often include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and enlarged lymph nodes. In some cases, the skin may also be affected, with a rash or itching.

There is no cure for T-PLL, but treatment can help to control the disease and improve the quality of life for people with the condition. Treatment usually involves chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/Sézary syndrome is a type of lymphoma that affects the skin. It is characterized by an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes in the skin, which can cause a rash or itching. However, the patient in this case does not have any skin lesions, so this diagnosis is not likely.
* Polycythemia rubra vera is a condition that causes the body to produce too many red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and headaches. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, so this diagnosis is not likely.
* Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including a rash, itching, and joint pain. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of lupus, so this diagnosis is not likely.

The patient has multiple coronary artery aneurysms, which are sac-like bulges in the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Aneurysms can rupture, causing a heart attack. The patient also has a large aneurysm with a thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). A thrombosis is a blood clot that can block the flow of blood through an artery. The patient's symptoms, laboratory test results, and imaging studies suggest that he has a condition called IgG4-related sclerosing disease, which can cause inflammation and damage to the blood vessels.

High-dose corticosteroid therapy and high-dose immunosuppressant therapy are both used to treat autoimmune conditions, such as IgG4-related sclerosing disease. However, these therapies are not effective in treating coronary artery aneurysms. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a procedure that is used to open blocked arteries. However, this procedure is not appropriate for patients with coronary artery aneurysms, as it can cause the aneurysms to rupture.

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the most effective treatment for coronary artery aneurysms. This surgery involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the aneurysm. This allows blood to flow around the aneurysm and reach the heart muscle.

The patient in this case should be treated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This surgery is the most effective way to treat his coronary artery aneurysms and prevent a heart attack.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer that affects the tongue. It is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the surface of the tongue. Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in people who smoke, drink alcohol, or have a history of oral HPV infection. The most common symptom of squamous cell carcinoma is a sore on the tongue that does not heal. Other symptoms may include pain, bleeding, and a change in the way the tongue looks or feels.

Oral eosinophilic ulcer is a rare condition that causes ulcers to form on the inside of the mouth. The ulcers are usually small and painless, but they can be larger and more painful in some cases. The cause of oral eosinophilic ulcers is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by an allergic reaction. The most common symptom of oral eosinophilic ulcers is a sore on the inside of the mouth that does not heal. Other symptoms may include pain, bleeding, and a change in the way the tongue looks or feels.

Abscess is a collection of pus that forms when bacteria infect a tissue. Abscesses can form anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin, gums, and teeth. The most common symptom of an abscess is pain. Other symptoms may include redness, swelling, and tenderness.

Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the muscles. It is most common in children and young adults. The most common symptom of pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma is a painless mass that grows on the face, neck, or arms or legs. Other symptoms may include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the affected area.

The patient in the case presented with a 4- to 5-cm pedunculated, ulcerative mass on the dorsal oral aspect of the tongue near midline, anterior to the foramen cecum, without palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a rim-enhancing, centrally hypodense lesion in the right dorsal tongue abutting the lingual septum with a somewhat ill-defined border. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have any risk factors for this type of cancer. Additionally, the patient's mass is not ulcerated, which is a common finding in squamous cell carcinoma.

Oral eosinophilic ulcer is a less likely diagnosis because the patient's mass is not painful. Additionally, the patient's mass is not associated with any other symptoms of oral eosinophilic ulcer, such as redness and swelling.

Abscess is a less likely diagnosis because the patient's mass is not associated with any symptoms of infection, such as redness, swelling, and tenderness. Additionally, the patient's mass is not located in an area where abscesses are commonly found, such as the skin or gums.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma.

B. Gigantiform cementoma is a rare benign bone tumor that is characterized by the growth of abnormal cementum-like tissue. This can lead to a number of problems, including bone pain, fractures, and deformity. Gigantiform cementoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient has a history of multiple surgical procedures for osseous lesions in the upper and lower jaws, and the imaging findings show a dense, expansile, sclerotic mass with moderate calcifications obstructing the left nasolacrimal duct. The histologic findings also show a proliferation of highly cellular, fibrous connective tissue and cementum-like hard tissue.

A multifocal canalicular adenoma is a benign tumor of the salivary glands. It is characterized by multiple, small, well-circumscribed nodules that are located within the submucosa of the lip. The nodules are typically smooth, round, and non-tender. They may be white, yellow, or pink in color.

The most common symptom of a multifocal canalicular adenoma is a painless mass on the lip. The mass may be present for several weeks or months before it is noticed. Other symptoms may include bleeding, ulceration, or infection of the mass.

The diagnosis of a multifocal canalicular adenoma is made based on a physical examination and a biopsy of the mass. The biopsy will show the characteristic features of a canalicular adenoma, which include acini (small glands) that are lined with cells that have a canalicular (tube-like) appearance.

The treatment for a multifocal canalicular adenoma is surgical excision. The mass is removed completely, and the margins of the surgical site are examined to ensure that all of the tumor has been removed.

The prognosis for a multifocal canalicular adenoma is excellent. The tumor is benign and does not spread to other parts of the body. The risk of recurrence is low.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Multifocal basal cell adenoma is a type of basal cell carcinoma, which is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinomas are typically found on the face, neck, and hands. They are rarely found on the lip.
* B. Basal cell adenocarcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer. It is typically found on the face, neck, and hands. It is rarely found on the lip.
* D. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a type of salivary gland cancer. It is typically found in the parotid gland, which is located in front of the ear. It is rarely found in the lip.

 38%|███▊      | 574/1525 [2:21:31<4:00:19, 15.16s/it]The correct answer is A. Biopsy the lesions.

The patient has a history of painful and slightly pruritic skin lesions on his right flank that have been present for 8 years. The number and degree of pain have alternately increased and decreased over the years. Occasionally the lesions rupture and leak clear fluid. One year prior, he was hospitalized for a “skin infection” on his right flank and treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He had 1 lifetime female sexual partner with whom he used barrier contraception.

Physical examination reveals an asymmetric cluster of lesions on the right flank measuring 14 × 12 cm at the widest margins. The cluster contains verrucous papules and plaques in the center and vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid in the periphery. Crust is partially covering some of the lesions. The surrounding skin is erythematous without warmth or induration. The remainder of the physical examination is normal except for stretch marks on the lateral abdomen.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's skin lesions is broad and includes a number of infectious and non-infectious conditions. Some of the more common infectious causes include herpes zoster, molluscum contagiosum, and verrucae. Non-infectious causes include psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis.

In order to establish a definitive diagnosis, it is necessary to biopsy the lesions. A biopsy will allow the pathologist to examine the tissue under a microscope and make a diagnosis. This information will then be used to determine the best course of treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B (Prescribe oral valacyclovir) is incorrect because valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes zoster. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that he has herpes zoster.
* Option C (Prescribe topical cantharadin) is incorrect because cantharadin is a topical medication that is used to treat warts. However, the patient's lesions do not appear to be warts.
* Option D (Recommend a gluten-free diet) is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's skin lesions are caused by celiac disease.

 38%|███▊      | 575/1525 [2:21:48<4:05:47, 15.52s/it]The correct answer is B. Exploratory laparotomy.

An exploratory laparotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the abdomen to look for and treat the cause of abdominal pain. It is the most invasive of the four options, but it is also the most likely to provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment.

The other three options are less invasive, but they are also less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment. Esophagogastrojejunoscopy is a procedure that involves inserting a tube into the esophagus to view the stomach and small intestine. Highly selective mesenteric angiography is a procedure that involves injecting dye into the mesenteric arteries to view the blood vessels in the small intestine. Diagnostic laparoscopy is a procedure that involves making a small incision in the abdomen and inserting a camera to view the abdominal cavity.

In this case, the patient has a history of gastric bypass surgery, which can increase the risk of mesenteric vascular compromise. Mesenteric vascular compromise is a condition in which the blood supply to the small intestine is reduced, which can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the small intestine. The patient's symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with mesenteric vascular compromise. The CT scan findings of mesenteric vascular compromise provide further evidence of this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history, symptoms, and CT scan findings, an exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate next step. This procedure will allow the surgeon to directly visualize the small intestine and look for evidence of mesenteric vascular compromise. If mesenteric vascular compromise is found, the surgeon can repair the blood vessels or resect the affected portion of the small intestine.

Esophagogastrojejunoscopy, highly selective mesenteric angiography, and diagnostic laparoscopy are all less invasive procedures, but they are also less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment. In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and her condition is life-threatening. Therefore, an exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate next step.

 38%|███▊      | 576/1525 [2:22:04<4:07:11, 15.63s/it]The correct answer is A. Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc.

The patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, which can cause malabsorption of nutrients, including iron, copper, and zinc. These nutrients are essential for normal hematopoiesis, so it is important to check their levels in patients with pancytopenia who have a history of gastric bypass surgery.

Option B is incorrect because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's pancytopenia. The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to malabsorption of nutrients, so it is important to treat the underlying cause by correcting the malabsorption.

Option C is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate initial management for a patient with pancytopenia. The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to malabsorption of nutrients, so it is important to treat the underlying cause by correcting the malabsorption. Endoscopy is not necessary to diagnose or treat malabsorption.

Option D is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate initial management for a patient with pancytopenia. The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to malabsorption of nutrients, so it is important to treat the underlying cause by correcting the malabsorption. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated for the treatment of pancytopenia due to malabsorption.

The patient is a young woman who presents with recurrent bullous lesions on her forearms. The lesions are round, erythematous, and have central pallor and confluent blisters at the periphery. They have been present for 9 years, with a symptom-free period of 2 years. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and topical steroids without lasting effect. She denies self-inflicting the lesions.

The histopathologic specimen shows normal stratum corneum, confluent necrosis of the upper epidermal layers, some multinucleated keratinocytes in the adjacent epidermis, and papillary edema with a subepidermal blister. A moderately dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophilic and neutrophilic granulocytes is present in the upper dermis.

These findings are consistent with cryothermic dermatitis artefacta. Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent, self-inflicted skin lesions caused by exposure to cold. The lesions are typically located on the extremities, and they may be painful or pruritic. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is a chronic, autoimmune blistering disease characterized by linear deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities, and they may be associated with mucosal involvement.

PP is a rare, chronic, pruritic dermatosis characterized by the eruption of erythematous papules and plaques that evolve into brown or black hyperpigmentation. The lesions are typically found on the flexural surfaces of the arms and legs, but can also occur on the trunk and neck. The etiology of PP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The clinical presentation of PP is consistent with the patient's history and physical examination. The patient is an adolescent girl with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). She presented for evaluation of hyperpigmented skin lesions affecting her neck, upper limbs, and trunk. The lesions had started about 6 months previously as recurrent crops of pruritic erythematous papules that subsided leaving behind brownish-bluish black hyperpigmentation after each episode.

The histopathologic findings of PP are also consistent with the patient's presentation. The biopsy specimen shows mild epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, multiple foci of spongiosis, and an enhanced basal layer pigmentation. There is scant lichenoid and moderate perivascular lymphomononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltrate, basal cell vacuolization, and melanin incontinence.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

A. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare, chronic, papulosquamous eruption characterized by the eruption of confluent and reticulated papules on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are typically brown or tan in color and may be pruritic. The etiology of CRP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

B. Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is a chronic, pruritic dermatosis characterized by the eruption of violaceous papules that evolve into brown or black hyperpigmentation. The lesions are typically found on the trunk and extremities, but can also occur on the face and scalp. The etiology of LPP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

C. Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, chronic, progressive dermatosis characterized by the eruption of erythematous papules and plaques that evolve into brown or black hyperpigmentation. The lesions are typically found on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The etiology of Dowling-Degos disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

D. Pityriasis versicolor is a common, superficial fungal infection of the skin characterized by the eruption of scaly, hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules.

Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects children. It is characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, and inflammation of the eyes, lungs, and other organs. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, such as fever, rash, or inflammation of the eyes, lungs, or other organs.

Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy is a condition that occurs in people with lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. It is characterized by inflammation of the bones and joints, as well as clubbing of the fingers and toes. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, such as clubbing of the fingers and toes.

Serum sickness-like reaction is a reaction to certain medications, such as penicillin. It is characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, and swelling of the lymph nodes. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of serum sickness-like reaction, such as fever or swelling of the lymph nodes.

Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis is a condition that occurs in people with cystic fibrosis. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain and inflammation. The patient in this case has a history of recurrent episodes of joint pain and inflammation, as well as the typical skin rash associated with cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis.

 38%|███▊      | 580/1525 [2:23:06<4:09:00, 15.81s/it]The correct answer is C. Diabetic striatopathy.

Diabetic striatopathy is a condition that affects the striatum, a part of the brain that is involved in movement. It is caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the striatum, which can lead to the death of nerve cells. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including chorea, which is a type of involuntary movement.

The patient in the case presented with persistent chorea in the left upper extremity for about 1 month despite aggressive correction with insulin. This suggests that the chorea is not caused by a medication or another medical condition. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years that was complicated by neuropathy and retinopathy. This suggests that the patient has diabetic striatopathy.

The patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed a T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and a lentiform nucleus with no restricted diffusion. This is consistent with the diagnosis of diabetic striatopathy.

The other choices are incorrect.

* Postinfectious/autoimmune chorea is a condition that can cause chorea after an infection or autoimmune disease. However, the patient in the case did not have any recent infections or risk for HIV infection.
* Paraneoplastic chorea is a condition that can cause chorea as a result of a cancer. However, the patient in the case did not have any evidence of cancer.
* Acute stroke is a condition that can cause chorea as a result of damage to the brain. However, the patient in the case did not have any evidence of a stroke on the MRI.

 38%|███▊      | 581/1525 [2:23:22<4:10:50, 15.94s/it]The correct answer is B: Perform scleral biopsy.

The patient has been experiencing chronic eye redness and pain for 9 months, despite treatment with oral and topical corticosteroids and azathioprine. The patient's history of asthma and hypereosinophilic syndrome suggests a possible underlying systemic inflammatory condition. The patient's examination shows scleral hyperemia, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions.

A scleral biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small piece of sclera is removed for microscopic examination. A scleral biopsy can help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's inflammation and guide further treatment.

Increasing the dosage of oral corticosteroids or azathioprine is not likely to be helpful, as the patient has already been treated with these medications for 9 months without improvement. Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroid use is also unlikely to be helpful, as the patient has already been treated with topical corticosteroids for 9 months without improvement.

Therefore, the best next step is to perform a scleral biopsy to determine the underlying cause of the patient's inflammation and guide further treatment.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not likely to be helpful in the management of this patient's condition.

 38%|███▊      | 582/1525 [2:23:37<4:07:10, 15.73s/it]The correct answer is A. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).

OCTA is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to create detailed images of the retina. It is particularly useful for diagnosing and monitoring diseases of the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision.

In this case, the patient has a central scotoma, which is a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. This can be caused by a number of conditions, including macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and optic nerve damage. OCTA can be used to diagnose the underlying cause of the scotoma and to monitor the progression of the disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not as sensitive or specific as OCTA for diagnosing and monitoring macular diseases.

* Automated visual field (AVF) is a test that measures the sensitivity of the retina to light. It is a useful tool for diagnosing glaucoma, but it is not as sensitive as OCTA for detecting early changes in the macula.
* Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is a useful tool for diagnosing retinal diseases, but it is not as specific as OCTA for diagnosing macular diseases.
* Microperimetry is a test that measures the visual field using a small spot of light. It is a useful tool for diagnosing glaucoma, but it is not as sensitive as OCTA for detecting early changes in the macula.

 38%|███▊      | 583/1525 [2:23:48<3:45:36, 14.37s/it]The correct answer is B. Recheck IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap.

The patient has a history of LASIK surgery, which can cause a number of complications, including elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The patient's current presentation is consistent with elevated IOP, as he is experiencing pain, decreased vision, and corneal edema. The patient's IOP was initially measured with a TonoPen, which is a handheld tonometer that uses applanation to measure IOP. However, TonoPen measurements can be inaccurate in patients with corneal edema, as the edema can cause the cornea to be too soft for the TonoPen to accurately measure IOP. Therefore, it is necessary to recheck the IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap. A handheld tonometer that uses applanation to measure IOP is the most accurate way to measure IOP in patients with corneal edema.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Increasing the frequency of prednisolone administration will not lower the patient's IOP. Injecting foscarnet sodium intravitreally is not indicated for the treatment of elevated IOP. Reassuring the patient and rechecking IOP in 1 week is not an appropriate management plan for a patient with elevated IOP.

 38%|███▊      | 584/1525 [2:24:02<3:43:26, 14.25s/it]The correct answer is C. Treat with oral corticosteroids.

The patient in the case has a choroidal mass that is suspicious for retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a rare, but aggressive, type of eye cancer that occurs in children. The most common treatment for retinoblastoma is chemotherapy. However, in some cases, corticosteroids may be used as an alternative or adjuvant therapy.

Corticosteroids work by suppressing the immune system. This can help to reduce the inflammation and swelling associated with retinoblastoma. In some cases, corticosteroids can also help to shrink the tumor.

There are several advantages to using corticosteroids to treat retinoblastoma. First, corticosteroids are relatively safe and well-tolerated. Second, they can be given orally, which makes them more convenient than other forms of treatment, such as chemotherapy. Third, corticosteroids can be used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

However, there are also some disadvantages to using corticosteroids to treat retinoblastoma. First, corticosteroids can cause side effects, such as weight gain, mood swings, and high blood pressure. Second, corticosteroids can suppress the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to infection. Third, corticosteroids can cause the retina to detach from the back of the eye.

Overall, the use of corticosteroids to treat retinoblastoma is a complex decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis. The benefits of using corticosteroids must be weighed against the risks. In the case of the patient in the case, the benefits of using corticosteroids outweigh the risks. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Treat with oral corticosteroids.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Treat with intra-arterial chemotherapy is incorrect because intra-arterial chemotherapy is a more aggressive treatment that is usually reserved for patients with advanced retinoblastoma. The patient in the case has a localized tumor that is not yet metastatic. Therefore, intra-arterial chemotherapy would be an unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment.
* Option B: Treat with plaque radiotherapy is incorrect because plaque radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is usually reserved for patients with tumors that are located near the optic nerve. The tumor in the case is located in the macula, which is the central part of the retina. Therefore, plaque radiotherapy would be an unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment.
* Option D: Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy is incorrect because fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a diagnostic procedure that is used to obtain a sample of tissue for testing. The diagnosis of retinoblastoma is usually made based on the clinical presentation and imaging studies. Therefore, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy would not be necessary or helpful in the case of the patient in the case.

 38%|███▊      | 585/1525 [2:24:18<3:53:00, 14.87s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain additional imaging.

The patient is a woman in her mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules who presents for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when she reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. She did not report any pain or diplopia.

The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for a mass in the right orbit. The proptosis, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion are consistent with a mass that is displacing the globe forward. The erythema and prominence of the palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland are also concerning for a mass in this area. The abduction deficit is likely due to compression of the sixth cranial nerve (CN VI) by the mass. The pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification are unrelated to the patient's current presentation.

The initial CT scan of the orbits without contrast was not helpful in determining the cause of the patient's mass. The scan showed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland, but no lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen.

The next step in the patient's management should be to obtain additional imaging. A CT scan of the orbits with contrast or an MRI of the orbits may be helpful in further defining the nature of the mass and determining if it is malignant. If the mass is determined to be malignant, the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove the mass.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, arrange 6-month follow-up, is incorrect because the patient's condition is progressive and she is at risk for further visual loss.
* Option C, perform an incisional biopsy, is incorrect because an incisional biopsy would not provide enough tissue for a definitive diagnosis.
* Option D, perform an excisional biopsy, is incorrect because an excisional biopsy would not be possible due to the location of the mass.

The patient has a history of thyroid cancer, and her ptosis began 10 months after her thyroidectomy. This suggests that she may have a recurrence of her thyroid cancer, which can cause ptosis as a result of compression of the oculomotor nerve. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits can help to confirm this diagnosis.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most likely cause of the patient's ptosis.

A. Check myasthenia laboratory findings and commence pyridostigmine trial is incorrect because the patient does not have any other symptoms of myasthenia gravis, such as double vision, weakness, or fatigue.

C. Müller muscle conjunctival resection and D. External levator advancement are incorrect because these are surgical procedures that are used to treat ptosis that is caused by a weakness of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. However, the patient's ptosis is likely caused by compression of the oculomotor nerve, so these procedures would not be effective.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomographic imaging of the orbits.

 38%|███▊      | 587/1525 [2:24:49<3:57:07, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is Apical non–small cell lung cancer with sympathetic nerve involvement.

The patient presented with a large, 12-cm left upper lobe mass abutting the anterior chest wall pleura and extending into the mediastinum, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as several liver lesions. A biopsy revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with a primary tumor in the lung. On presentation to our multidisciplinary clinic, he reported constant, bothersome sweating of the left forehead. On physical examination, a well-demarcated area of erythematous, perspiring skin on the left forehead was noted.

The sympathetic trunk is a chain of nerves that runs from the base of the skull to the coccyx. It is responsible for controlling many involuntary functions, including sweating, heart rate, and blood pressure. When the sympathetic trunk is compressed or invaded by a tumor, it can cause a condition known as Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms: ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), miosis (constriction of the pupil), and anhidrosis (loss of sweating) on the ipsilateral side of the face.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of hemifacial hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating on the left forehead) are consistent with Horner's syndrome. The most likely cause of Horner's syndrome in this patient is compression or invasion of the left sympathetic trunk by the apical non–small cell lung cancer.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cervical spinal cord compression can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and pain in the arms and legs. However, it does not typically cause sweating.
* Impingement of the left sympathetic trunk can cause Horner's syndrome. However, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.
* Right cervical ganglion invasion can cause Horner's syndrome. However, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.
* Transection of the left sympathetic trunk can cause Horner's syndrome. However, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.

 39%|███▊      | 588/1525 [2:24:59<3:35:03, 13.77s/it]The correct answer is B. Electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation.

The patient in this case has a history of hypertension and has presented with multiple episodes of palpitations with near syncope. While in the emergency department, she developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. She continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. She was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement.

The presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block morphology. This is consistent with ventricular tachycardia. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are all consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.

Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is a common arrhythmia that occurs in patients with no structural heart disease. It is usually benign and does not require treatment. However, in some patients, it can cause symptoms such as palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. In these patients, treatment may be necessary to prevent further episodes of arrhythmia.

The most common treatment for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy to destroy the areas of the heart that are responsible for the arrhythmia. Catheter ablation is a safe and effective procedure that can cure idiopathic ventricular tachycardia in the majority of patients.

In the case of the patient in this question, the best course of action is to perform an electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation. The electrophysiology study will allow the doctor to map the patient's heart and identify the areas that are responsible for the arrhythmia. If the arrhythmia can be mapped, then catheter ablation can be performed to destroy the areas of the heart that are responsible for the arrhythmia. This will cure the patient's arrhythmia and prevent further episodes.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is not the best course of action in this case because the patient does not have structural heart disease. ICDs are typically used to treat patients with life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation. The patient in this case has a benign arrhythmia that does not require an ICD.

C. Discharge with oral antiarrhythmic therapy with a class I or III agent is not the best course of action in this case because oral antiarrhythmic drugs can have serious side effects. Oral antiarrhythmic drugs are typically used to treat patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. The patient in this case has a benign arrhythmia that does not require oral antiarrhythmic drugs.

D. Discharge with oral β-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is not the best course of action in this case because these drugs are not effective for treating idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. Oral β-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are typically used to treat patients with high blood pressure or angina. The patient in this case does not have high blood pressure or angina.

 39%|███▊      | 589/1525 [2:25:14<3:40:39, 14.14s/it]The correct diagnosis is a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation (LVM). This is a type of vascular malformation that is composed of both lymphatic and venous channels. LVMs are typically congenital (present at birth), but they can also develop later in life. They are most commonly found in the head and neck region, but they can occur anywhere in the body.

The most common symptom of an LVM is a mass or swelling. The mass may be painful or non-painful, and it may be present at birth or develop later in life. Other symptoms may include bleeding, infection, and ulceration.

The diagnosis of an LVM is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Imaging studies such as ultrasound, MRI, and CT scan can help to determine the size, location, and extent of the malformation.

The treatment of an LVM depends on the size, location, and symptoms of the malformation. Small, asymptomatic LVMs may not require treatment. Larger or symptomatic LVMs may be treated with surgery, embolization, or sclerotherapy.

In the case of the patient in the question, the diagnosis of a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation is supported by the following findings:

* The patient is a young woman, which is the age group in which LVMs are most commonly diagnosed.
* The mass is located in the right oropharynx, which is a common location for LVMs.
* The mass is partially obstructing the airway, which is a common symptom of LVMs.
* The mass is without ulceration, exudate, or erythema, which is not typical of squamous cell carcinoma or hemangioma.
* The mass is continuous with the right tonsil, which is not typical of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the oropharynx. However, the patient in the question does not have any of the typical risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or a history of head and neck radiation. Additionally, the mass in the patient's case is not ulcerated or erythematous, which are typical features of squamous cell carcinoma.
* Hemangioma is a type of benign vascular tumor that can occur in the oropharynx. However, the patient in the question does not have any of the typical risk factors for hemangioma, such as a family history of hemangiomas or exposure to certain medications or chemicals. Additionally, the mass in the patient's case is not ulcerated or erythematous, which are typical features of hemangioma.
* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the lymph nodes. However, the patient in the question does not have any of the typical risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, such as an autoimmune disease or exposure to certain viruses. Additionally, the mass in the patient's case is not continuous with the right tonsil, which is a typical feature of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

 39%|███▊      | 590/1525 [2:25:31<3:51:27, 14.85s/it]The correct answer is C. Neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis.

The patient in the case report presents with a history of flu-like symptoms followed by facial nerve paralysis, hearing loss, tinnitus, and otalgia. The MRI findings show abnormal enhancement of the facial nerve in the superior distal IAC, labyrinthine segment, and geniculate ganglion. These findings are consistent with neuroborreliosis, a neurological condition caused by infection with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi.

Vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the vestibular nerve. It is the most common type of schwannoma, and it typically presents with hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. The MRI findings in vestibular schwannoma are typically more focal than those seen in neuroborreliosis, and they often show a cystic component.

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a condition in which there is a sudden and unexplained loss of hearing. It is the most common cause of hearing loss in adults, and it typically presents with unilateral hearing loss. The MRI findings in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss are typically normal.

Facial nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the facial nerve. It is a rare condition, and it typically presents with facial paralysis. The MRI findings in facial nerve schwannoma are typically more focal than those seen in neuroborreliosis, and they often show a cystic component.

In conclusion, the patient in the case report most likely has neuroborreliosis. The clinical presentation, MRI findings, and history of exposure to ticks are all consistent with this diagnosis.

 39%|███▉      | 591/1525 [2:25:47<3:58:52, 15.35s/it]The correct answer is B. Cystic teratoma (mature).

A macrocystic lymphatic malformation is a type of lymphatic anomaly that is characterized by the presence of large cysts filled with lymph fluid. These lesions are typically benign and do not require treatment. However, in some cases, they can grow large enough to cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing. If a macrocystic lymphatic malformation is causing symptoms, it may be treated with surgery to remove the lesion.

A foregut duplication cyst is a type of congenital anomaly that is characterized by the presence of a cyst that develops from the foregut, which is the part of the embryo that develops into the stomach, small intestine, and esophagus. These cysts are typically benign and do not require treatment. However, in some cases, they can grow large enough to cause symptoms such as pain, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing. If a foregut duplication cyst is causing symptoms, it may be treated with surgery to remove the lesion.

A dermoid cyst is a type of benign tumor that is made up of skin cells. These cysts are typically found on the face, neck, or back. They are usually small and painless, but they can grow large enough to cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing. If a dermoid cyst is causing symptoms, it may be treated with surgery to remove the lesion.

In the case of the newborn with a sublingual mass, the most likely diagnosis is a cystic teratoma (mature). This is because the mass is described as being "thin-walled, multiloculated," and "bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging." These findings are characteristic of a cystic teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor that contains mature tissue from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). Cystic teratomas are typically benign and do not require treatment. However, in some cases, they can grow large enough to cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing. If a cystic teratoma is causing symptoms, it may be treated with surgery to remove the lesion.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses in this case. A macrocystic lymphatic malformation would be more likely to be located in the neck or axilla, and it would not be expected to have the same imaging findings as a cystic teratoma. A foregut duplication cyst would be more likely to be located in the abdomen, and it would not be expected to have the same imaging findings as a cystic teratoma. A dermoid cyst would be more likely to be located on the face or scalp, and it would not be expected to have the same imaging findings as a cystic teratoma.

 39%|███▉      | 592/1525 [2:26:01<3:48:57, 14.72s/it]The correct answer is B. Alternative CFTR functional testing.

The patient has a family history of CF, and her symptoms are consistent with the disease. However, her sweat chloride tests were indeterminate, and her initial genetic testing was negative. This suggests that she may have a CFTR mutation that is not detected by standard testing. Alternative CFTR functional testing can be used to identify these mutations.

Additional genetic testing is not necessary, as the patient has already undergone a 97-mutation CFTR analysis panel. Repeat sweat chloride analysis is also not necessary, as the patient's previous tests were indeterminate. No further testing is needed if the patient does not have CF, but this is not the case in this patient.

Alternative CFTR functional testing is the best option to determine if the patient has CF. This testing can identify mutations that are not detected by standard testing. If the patient does have a CFTR mutation, she will need to be treated for CF.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* Additional genetic testing: This would not be necessary, as the patient has already undergone a 97-mutation CFTR analysis panel. This panel tests for the most common CFTR mutations, and it is unlikely that the patient has a mutation that is not included in this panel.
* Repeat sweat chloride analysis: This would not be necessary, as the patient's previous tests were indeterminate. Indeterminate sweat chloride tests can be due to a number of factors, including technical errors, so repeating the test is not likely to be helpful.
* No further testing; the patient does not have CF: This is not the correct answer, as the patient has a family history of CF and her symptoms are consistent with the disease. It is possible that she has a CFTR mutation that is not detected by standard testing. Alternative CFTR functional testing can be used to identify these mutations.

 39%|███▉      | 593/1525 [2:26:15<3:45:55, 14.54s/it]The correct answer is A. Initiate topical steroid eyedrop therapy.

The patient has a history of a black ink tattoo on his left arm, and he has been experiencing blurred vision for the past year. He also has inflammation of the skin surrounding the tattoo. The physical examination reveals elevated intraocular pressure in the left eye, and a slit lamp examination shows inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the left eye. A punch biopsy of the tattooed skin reveals epithelioid histiocytes with macrophages containing coarse black granular pigment. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tattoo-associated scleritis.

Tattoo-associated scleritis is a rare inflammatory condition that occurs in patients with tattoos. It is thought to be caused by an immune reaction to the ink in the tattoo. The condition can cause severe pain, redness, and inflammation of the sclera, the white of the eye. In some cases, it can also lead to vision loss.

The treatment for tattoo-associated scleritis is typically with topical steroid eyedrops. These eyedrops help to reduce inflammation and pain. In some cases, oral steroids or other medications may also be necessary. In severe cases, surgery may be required to remove the tattoo.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of tattoo-associated scleritis. The correct treatment is to initiate topical steroid eyedrop therapy. This will help to reduce inflammation and pain. The patient should also be monitored closely for any signs of vision loss. If vision loss occurs, the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove the tattoo.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B, recommend removal of tattoos, is incorrect because it is not the first-line treatment for tattoo-associated scleritis. Topical steroid eyedrop therapy is the first-line treatment. Removal of the tattoo may be necessary in some cases, but it is not typically the first-line treatment.
* Option C, refer immediately to rheumatology, is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient has a rheumatologic condition. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of tattoo-associated scleritis, which is not a rheumatologic condition.
* Option D, perform surgical implantation of glaucoma drainage device, is incorrect because the patient does not have glaucoma. The patient's elevated intraocular pressure is likely due to inflammation of the sclera, not glaucoma.

 39%|███▉      | 594/1525 [2:26:25<3:25:01, 13.21s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites.

The rash in this case is most consistent with scabies, a contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is characterized by a papular and vesicular eruption, often with burrows, that is typically worse at night. The differential diagnosis for scabies includes other papular and vesicular eruptions, such as varicella zoster virus infection (chickenpox), impetigo, and contact dermatitis.

The history in this case is also consistent with scabies. The infant was exposed to a babysitter who had pruritus, a common symptom of scabies. The infant's rash is also widespread, which is also typical of scabies.

The physical examination findings in this case are also consistent with scabies. The infant has multiple disseminated, edematous, pin-sized, papulopustulovesicles and 5- to 10-mm coalescing, crusted nodules all over the body. Some of the lesions have oval to elongated, serpiginous or J-shaped burrows. The presence of burrows is a classic sign of scabies.

The laboratory findings in this case are not helpful in making the diagnosis of scabies. The Tzanck smear, Gram stain, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation all showed no abnormal findings. The differential of a complete blood cell count showed 12% eosinophils, which is a non-specific finding that may be seen in a variety of skin conditions, including scabies.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this case is to perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites. This will allow for microscopic examination of the scrapings to identify the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. If the mite is identified, the diagnosis of scabies can be confirmed and treatment can be initiated.

The other options are incorrect. Option A, administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, is not appropriate because the rash is not caused by an infection. Option B, starting a topical steroid, is not appropriate because scabies is a parasitic infection, not an inflammatory condition. Option D, doing nothing and reassuring the parents, is not appropriate because scabies is a contagious skin infection that can spread to other people.

 39%|███▉      | 595/1525 [2:26:41<3:39:43, 14.18s/it]The correct diagnosis is pyoderma vegetans. Pyoderma vegetans is a rare, chronic, pyoderma characterized by vegetating, exuberant, and often ulcerative lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. It is most commonly seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn disease. The lesions are typically located in the perineal and perianal regions, but can also occur on the face, scalp, trunk, and extremities. The cause of pyoderma vegetans is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder. The treatment of pyoderma vegetans is challenging and often unsatisfactory. Treatment options include topical and systemic antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, and surgery.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, and progressive skin disease characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers. It is most commonly seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn disease. The lesions are typically located on the lower extremities, but can also occur on the upper extremities, trunk, and face. The cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder. The treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is challenging and often unsatisfactory. Treatment options include topical and systemic antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, and surgery.

Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. It is most commonly seen in the southeastern United States, but can also occur in other parts of the world. The infection is typically acquired through inhalation of spores from the environment. The most common symptoms of blastomycosis are fever, cough, and chest pain. The infection can also spread to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, and central nervous system. The treatment of blastomycosis is with antifungal medications.

Halogenoderma is a term used to describe a group of skin diseases that are caused by exposure to halogens, such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The most common symptoms of halogenoderma are itching, redness, and blistering of the skin. The treatment of halogenoderma is with topical and systemic corticosteroids.

In the case presented, the patient has a 2-week history of vegetating, bleeding plaques and pustules on his face, scalp, trunk, and extremities. He reported that lesions began as pustules and developed into painful, itchy plaques. Before evaluation at a referral hospital in Kenya, the patient was treated with prednisolone tablet 5 mg twice daily, clindamycin hydrochloride 300 mg daily, and fluconazole 200 mg daily, but he continued to develop new lesions. A complete review of systems was notable for the patient’s difficulty with walking because of skin lesions. On examination, pustules and hemorrhagic-crusted plaques were seen on the scalp, legs, arms, and trunk along with keloidal plaques on the face. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for HIV was negative. A punch biopsy specimen from the arm was obtained for histopathologic study. The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, dermal neutrophilia, and microabscesses with eosinophilia. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of pyoderma vegetans.

The other possible diagnoses, pyoderma gangrenosum, blastomycosis, and halogenoderma, are less likely in this case. Pyoderma gangrenosum is typically characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers, which are not present in this case. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that is most commonly seen in the southeastern United States. The patient in this case is from Kenya, which is not an area where blastomycosis is common. Halogenoderma is a term used to describe a group of skin diseases that are caused by exposure to halogens. The patient in this case has not been exposed to halogens.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is pyoderma vegetans.

The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but some patients may experience mild itching or burning. The cause of AMVC is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no cure for AMVC, but treatment can help to improve the appearance of the lesions.

The patient in the case presented with several round atrophic lesions on his face, symmetric and bilateral, that were located especially on the malar and preauricular areas, with a diameter of 5 to 10 mm. His skin lesions were not indurated and displayed no epidermal changes. The patient denied experiencing previous inflammation. He had no history of chicken pox or acne or traumatic lesions in those areas. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of AMVC.

Primary anetoderma is a rare, idiopathic disorder characterized by the development of small, atrophic macules on the face and trunk. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but some patients may experience mild itching or burning. The cause of primary anetoderma is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no cure for primary anetoderma, but treatment can help to improve the appearance of the lesions.

A plasmacytoma is a tumor of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the bone marrow. Plasmacytomas can be single or multiple, and can be benign or malignant.

The patient in the case has a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma, which is a type of plasma cell cancer that affects the bone marrow. He was treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous blood progenitor cell transplantation, which resulted in complete response. At the time of the consultation, he was free of disease.

The patient was referred for evaluation of an indolent, erythematous papule on his glans penis of 2 weeks’ duration. He denied sexual risk behavior and reported no recent changes in medication. Careful physical examination revealed a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the glans. There were no other skin lesions. The lymph nodes were not palpable, and there was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation.

The histopathological findings showed a proliferation of plasma cells in the dermis. The plasma cells were positive for immunoglobulin A (IgA) and kappa light chains. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of plasmacytoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Primary penile B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that affects the lymph nodes. It is not a common cause of penile tumors.
* Kaposi sarcoma of the penis is a type of cancer that is caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). It is a common cause of penile cancer in people who are infected with HIV.
* Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis is a rare condition that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the glans penis. It is not a common cause of penile tumors.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Plasmacytoma. The patient's history of multiple myeloma and the histopathological findings of a plasmacytoma in the glans penis are consistent with this diagnosis.

A sliding hernia is a type of inguinal hernia that occurs when a part of the bladder or intestine slides into the inguinal canal. This can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty voiding.

The patient in the case study has a history of right groin pain and increased urinary frequency with difficulty voiding. He also has a palpable and partially reducible right groin mass that extends into the scrotum. These findings are consistent with a sliding hernia.

A saphenous varix is a varicose vein that occurs in the saphenous vein, which is a large vein that runs from the foot to the groin. A saphenous varix is typically not painful and does not cause difficulty voiding.

An Amyand hernia is a type of inguinal hernia that occurs when the appendix is included in the hernia sac. The appendix is a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon. An Amyand hernia is a rare condition that is typically diagnosed in children.

A communicating hydrocele is a type of hydrocele that occurs when a communication exists between the scrotal sac and the peritoneal cavity. A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the scrotum. A communicating hydrocele is typically not painful and does not cause difficulty voiding.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Sliding hernia. The patient in the case study has a history of right groin pain and increased urinary frequency with difficulty voiding.

Crohn ileitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect the small intestine. It is characterized by inflammation, ulceration, and narrowing of the small intestine. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of Crohn ileitis, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. In addition, the patient's blood work is normal, which would not be expected in a patient with Crohn ileitis.

Foreign body ingestion is the accidental or intentional swallowing of a foreign object. The most common foreign objects that are swallowed are coins, pins, and buttons. The patient in this case does not have any history of foreign body ingestion. In addition, the patient's physical examination is not consistent with foreign body ingestion, such as the presence of a foreign body in the throat or esophagus.

Adenocarcinoma of the small intestine is a type of cancer that can affect the small intestine. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, such as weight loss, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. In addition, the patient's blood work is normal, which would not be expected in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the small intestine.

Ileo-colic intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the small intestine telescopes into the next portion of the small intestine. This can cause blockage of the small intestine and inflammation. The patient in this case has all of the typical symptoms of ileo-colic intussusception, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and a mass in the abdomen. In addition, the patient's physical examination is consistent with ileo-colic intussusception, such as the presence of a mass in the abdomen. The patient's blood work also shows an elevated white blood cell count, which is a sign of infection.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is ileo-colic intussusception.

The patient has a new central scotoma of the right eye 3 days after orthotopic liver transplant. He denied eye pain, floaters, and photopsias. The patient had his first liver transplant 12 years before presentation that failed despite immunosuppressive treatment with tacrolimus. He initiated mycophenolate mofetil treatment 2 months before his second transplant. In addition, the patient was positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG antibodies and had an undetectable CMV load 1 month before transplantation.

On examination, visual acuities were hand motions OD and J1 OS. The patient’s right pupil was sluggishly reactive with a relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 18 mm Hg OS. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full by confrontation. Anterior segment examination was within normal limits. Fundus photographs of the right eye are shown in the Figure, A. Findings of fundus examination of the left eye were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is CMV retinitis. CMV retinitis is a common and serious complication of solid organ transplantation, particularly in patients who are CMV seropositive and have received high-dose immunosuppression. The clinical presentation of CMV retinitis varies depending on the stage of the disease. In the acute phase, patients may present with floaters, blurred vision, or a visual field defect. As the disease progresses, patients may develop retinal necrosis and detachment, which can lead to blindness.

The diagnosis of CMV retinitis is made based on clinical findings and laboratory testing. Fundus examination typically shows retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and necrosis. Laboratory testing can be used to detect the presence of CMV DNA in the blood or vitreous humor.

The treatment of CMV retinitis is with antiviral agents such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. These agents can be administered intravenously or intravitreally. Intravitreal therapy is more effective than intravenous therapy, but it is associated with a higher risk of complications.

The prognosis for CMV retinitis is generally good if the disease is treated early. However, if the disease is left untreated, it can lead to blindness.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer choice A: Order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs that suggest a central nervous system infection.
* Answer choice C: Perform a vitreous tap and administer intravenous ganciclovir treatment is incorrect because intravenous ganciclovir is not as effective as intravitreal ganciclovir for the treatment of CMV retinitis.
* Answer choice D: Administer systemic steroid treatment is incorrect because steroids are not effective for the treatment of CMV retinitis.

 39%|███▉      | 601/1525 [2:28:19<4:08:47, 16.16s/it]The correct answer is C: Referral for cardiac biopsy. The patient has a history of breast cancer and has recently developed right eye visual field changes, optic nerve edema, and a peripapillary choroidal infiltrate. Testing results for an underlying neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious process were unrevealing. Four months prior to presentation, the patient developed a right bundle branch block, which progressed to complete heart block eight months later. These findings are concerning for metastatic breast cancer involving the heart. A cardiac biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose metastatic breast cancer to the heart. Chorioretinal biopsy would not be helpful in this case, as it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the patient's visual field changes. Observation would be an inappropriate management option, as the patient is at risk for progression of her metastatic breast cancer. Oral corticosteroid therapy would not be effective in treating metastatic breast cancer to the heart.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* **A. Chorioretinal biopsy:** A chorioretinal biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the choroid and retina. This procedure is typically used to diagnose or treat inflammatory or infectious diseases of the choroid and retina. In this case, a chorioretinal biopsy would not be helpful, as the patient's visual field changes are most likely due to metastatic breast cancer to the choroid.
* **B. Observation:** Observation is a management option for patients with choroidal infiltrates of unknown cause. However, in this case, the patient has a history of breast cancer and has recently developed right eye visual field changes, optic nerve edema, and a peripapillary choroidal infiltrate. These findings are concerning for metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, observation would be an inappropriate management option.
* **C. Referral for cardiac biopsy:** A cardiac biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the heart. This procedure is typically used to diagnose or treat inflammatory or infiltrative diseases of the heart. In this case, a cardiac biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose metastatic breast cancer involving the heart.
* **D. Oral corticosteroid therapy:** Oral corticosteroid therapy is a treatment option for inflammatory or infectious diseases of the choroid and retina. However, in this case, the patient's visual field changes are most likely due to metastatic breast cancer to the choroid. Oral corticosteroid therapy would not be effective in treating metastatic breast cancer.

The patient presented with blurred vision and wrinkled retinas in both eyes. He also had a history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor, also known as idiopathic orbital inflammation. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-cancerous inflammation of the tissues around the eye. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, double vision, pain, and swelling in the eye.

The gold standard for diagnosing orbital pseudotumor is a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits. A CT scan can show the presence of inflammation in the orbital tissues. It can also help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor or infection.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Option A, perform an orbital biopsy, is not the most appropriate next step because it is an invasive procedure that is not necessary to make the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor. A CT scan is a more accurate and less invasive way to diagnose the condition.
* Option C, obtain a consultation from the retina service, is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a retinal problem. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor, which is a condition that affects the tissues around the eye, not the retina.
* Option D, perform emergency canthotomy and cantholysis to decompress the orbits, is not the most appropriate next step because the patient does not have any signs of increased pressure in the orbits. Emergency canthotomy and cantholysis are procedures that are used to decompress the orbits in patients who have increased pressure in the orbits. This patient does not have any signs of increased pressure in the orbits, so these procedures are not necessary.

 40%|███▉      | 603/1525 [2:28:44<3:40:51, 14.37s/it]The correct answer is B. Orbitotomy with biopsy.

Empirical corticosteroid treatment is not the correct answer because the patient has positive results for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, which are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes. Orbital inflammation is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and it can be treated with corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are not curative, and they can have serious side effects. Therefore, orbitotomy with biopsy is the preferred treatment for orbital inflammation associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

External beam radiotherapy is not the correct answer because the patient has no evidence of malignancy. External beam radiotherapy is a treatment option for malignancy, but it is not the preferred treatment for orbital inflammation. Orbital inflammation is usually caused by an infection or an autoimmune disorder, and it can be treated with corticosteroids or other medications.

Intravenous antibiotic therapy is not the correct answer because the patient has no evidence of infection. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is a treatment option for infection, but it is not the preferred treatment for orbital inflammation. Orbital inflammation is usually caused by an autoimmune disorder or a noninfectious inflammatory process, and it can be treated with corticosteroids or other medications.

Orbitotomy with biopsy is the correct answer because it allows for a definitive diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of the orbital inflammation. Orbitotomy with biopsy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the orbit and removing a sample of tissue for pathological examination. This procedure can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders. Once the underlying cause of the orbital inflammation has been diagnosed, appropriate treatment can be initiated.

The patient has a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled hypertension, and breast cancer previously treated with tamoxifen. She presented with blurry vision in the right eye of 2 weeks’ duration. Dilated fundus examination results were notable for mild cataracts in both eyes and fine superficial retinal hemorrhages surrounded by a cluster of exudates in the right retina. An examination of the left retina produced unremarkable results.

The findings of fine superficial retinal hemorrhages surrounded by a cluster of exudates are consistent with cystoid macular edema. Cystoid macular edema is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. This can lead to blurred vision, distortion, and loss of central vision.

The most common cause of cystoid macular edema is diabetic retinopathy. However, it can also be caused by other conditions, such as hypertension, inflammation, and certain medications, including tamoxifen.

The treatment for cystoid macular edema depends on the underlying cause. In the case of diabetic retinopathy, treatment may include laser therapy, photocoagulation, or vitrectomy. In the case of hypertension, treatment may include medications to lower blood pressure. In the case of inflammation, treatment may include medications to reduce inflammation. In the case of tamoxifen, treatment may include discontinuation of the medication.

In the case of this patient, the most likely cause of her cystoid macular edema is her history of tamoxifen use. Tamoxifen is a medication that is used to treat breast cancer. It works by blocking the effects of estrogen, which can promote the growth of cancer cells. However, tamoxifen can also have side effects, including cystoid macular edema.

The treatment for cystoid macular edema caused by tamoxifen is intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection. Anti-VEGF injections are medications that block the production of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In the case of cystoid macular edema, VEGF can cause the growth of new blood vessels in the macula. These new blood vessels can leak fluid, which can lead to blurred vision, distortion, and loss of central vision.

Anti-VEGF injections are very effective in treating cystoid macular edema. They can reduce the amount of fluid in the macula and improve vision. In most cases, patients need to receive multiple injections over a period of time to maintain their vision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer B, Recommend continued blood glucose control and consider intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection or focal laser treatment if the macular edema persists, is incorrect because the patient's blood sugar is well-controlled. In addition, focal laser treatment is not effective in treating cystoid macular edema caused by tamoxifen.
* Answer C, Explain to the patient that these changes are medication-associated and recommend close observation, is incorrect because the patient needs to receive treatment for her cystoid macular edema.
* Answer D, Recommend referral to the patient’s primary care physician for stricter blood pressure control, is incorrect because the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled.

 40%|███▉      | 605/1525 [2:29:18<4:00:25, 15.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and orbits. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST). CST is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the cavernous sinus, a large venous sinus located in the skull base. CST can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, fever, eye pain, swelling, and redness of the eye, double vision, and vision loss. In some cases, CST can also lead to seizures, coma, and death.

The diagnosis of CST is made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as MRI. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting CST. It can show the presence of a blood clot in the cavernous sinus, as well as any associated abnormalities such as brain edema or hemorrhage.

The treatment of CST is aimed at preventing the spread of the clot and relieving the symptoms of the condition. This may include intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and anticoagulation therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the clot or to relieve pressure on the brain.

The prognosis for patients with CST varies depending on the severity of the condition. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients recover without any long-term sequelae. However, CST can be a life-threatening condition, and some patients may experience permanent neurological damage.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Reassurance and artificial tears are not appropriate treatment for CST. CST is a serious condition that requires medical attention.
* Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is not as sensitive as MRI for detecting CST. CT scan may be used to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brain tumor or stroke.
* Urgently referring to neurosurgery is not necessary in all cases of CST. Some patients with CST can be managed with medical therapy alone. However, surgery may be necessary in patients with severe symptoms or those who do not respond to medical treatment.

The patient's presentation is concerning for orbital inflammation, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infection, neoplasm, and autoimmune disease. Orbital inflammation can cause blurred vision, floaters, and pain. The patient's history of sinus congestion and left-sided jaw pain suggests that the inflammation may be secondary to an infection in the sinuses or teeth.

A head/maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the best way to evaluate the orbit for signs of inflammation. A CT scan is a more sensitive test for detecting bony abnormalities, such as infection or tumor, while an MRI scan is a more sensitive test for detecting soft tissue abnormalities, such as inflammation or tumor.

If the CT scan or MRI scan shows no evidence of infection or tumor, the next step would be to start the patient on topical or systemic steroids. Steroids are anti-inflammatory medications that can help to reduce the inflammation in the orbit.

If the patient does not respond to steroids, or if the CT scan or MRI scan shows evidence of infection or tumor, the next step would be to perform a vitreous biopsy. A vitreous biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of vitreous humor is removed from the eye and examined under a microscope. This can help to determine the cause of the inflammation.

The remaining choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Option A, "Observe," is incorrect because the patient's presentation is concerning for orbital inflammation, which can lead to serious vision loss if not treated.
* Option B, "Start topical or systemic steroids," is incorrect because the patient's CT scan or MRI scan does not show evidence of infection or tumor. Steroids are not indicated in the absence of infection or tumor.
* Option D, "Perform vitreous biopsy," is incorrect because the patient's CT scan or MRI scan does not show evidence of a vitreal lesion. A vitreous biopsy is not indicated in the absence of a vitreal lesion.

A secondary syphilis rash is typically a generalized, symmetrical eruption of papules, macules, and patches. The eruption often begins on the palms and soles and then spreads to the trunk, extremities, and face. The lesions are typically non-pruritic and may be accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and headache.

Lichen planus is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by flat-topped, purple papules with a lacy white border. The lesions are often pruritic and may occur on the skin, mucous membranes, nails, and scalp.

A lichenoid drug reaction is a type of allergic reaction to a medication that can cause a rash similar to lichen planus. The rash is typically pruritic and may occur on any part of the body.

Janeway lesions are small, painless, erythematous papules that occur on the palms and soles in patients with infective endocarditis. The lesions are caused by immune complexes that deposit in the small vessels of the skin.

In this case, the patient has a history of syphilis and is currently receiving pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that works by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. This pathway is involved in the regulation of the immune system, and its inhibition can lead to the development of autoimmune reactions.

The patient's rash is consistent with a lichenoid drug reaction. The rash is pruritic, and it is located on the soles of the feet, which is a common site for lichenoid drug reactions. The patient also has a history of syphilis, which is a risk factor for lichenoid drug reactions.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Secondary syphilis is unlikely in this case because the patient has no history of fever, lymphadenopathy, or headache.
* Lichen planus is unlikely in this case because the patient's rash is not associated with any of the typical features of lichen planus, such as oral lesions or nail changes.
* Janeway lesions are unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any of the typical features of infective endocarditis, such as fever, chills, or weight loss.

 40%|███▉      | 608/1525 [2:30:04<3:55:22, 15.40s/it]The correct answer is D. Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study.

The patient in this case has a history of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair. These are congenital heart defects that can lead to right-to-left shunts, which means that blood can flow from the right side of the heart to the left side of the heart without passing through the lungs. This can allow bacteria from the mouth and throat to enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain, where they can cause a brain abscess.

A transthoracic echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to create a moving image of the heart. A bubble study is a procedure that is performed during a transthoracic echocardiogram to detect the presence of a right-to-left shunt. In a bubble study, a small amount of a harmless gas is injected into a vein in the arm. The gas travels through the bloodstream and can be seen on the echocardiogram as it passes through the heart. If the gas appears in the left side of the heart, it indicates that there is a right-to-left shunt.

A transesophageal echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to create a moving image of the heart. However, it is performed from the esophagus, which is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. A transesophageal echocardiogram is more sensitive than a transthoracic echocardiogram for detecting right-to-left shunts. However, it is more invasive and is not usually necessary in this case.

Computed tomographic imaging of the chest can be used to detect a right-to-left shunt, but it is not as sensitive as a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is a more sensitive test for detecting right-to-left shunts, but it is also more expensive and time-consuming than a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study. This test is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting right-to-left shunts, and it is the least invasive test.

 40%|███▉      | 609/1525 [2:30:20<3:55:29, 15.43s/it]The correct answer is C. Ectopic pituitary adenoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the flat cells that line the nasopharynx. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the immune system. Granulomatous disease is a group of diseases that cause inflammation and the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of immune cells.

The patient in this case has a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism. These conditions are all associated with an increased risk of developing pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas are tumors that grow in the pituitary gland, which is a small gland located at the base of the brain. Pituitary adenomas can be classified as either functional or non-functional. Functional pituitary adenomas produce hormones that can cause symptoms such as headache, visual changes, and changes in hormone levels. Non-functional pituitary adenomas do not produce hormones and are usually found incidentally on imaging studies.

The patient in this case has a large, lobulated mass that is centered in the nasopharynx and extends into the left sphenoid sinus. The mass is intermediate in signal on T2-weighted imaging and enhances avidly on post-contrast imaging. These findings are most consistent with a pituitary adenoma. The fact that the patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism is also consistent with a diagnosis of pituitary adenoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis in this case because it is not typically associated with these risk factors. Lymphoma is also a less likely diagnosis because it is not typically a large, lobulated mass that extends into the sinuses. Granulomatous disease is a less likely diagnosis because it is not typically associated with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in this case is C. Ectopic pituitary adenoma.

 40%|████      | 610/1525 [2:30:36<3:59:51, 15.73s/it]The correct diagnosis is primary middle ear meningioma. The patient is a woman in her 30s who presented with a 1-year history of left ear fullness. She reported diminished left-sided hearing that would temporarily improve with autoinsufflation. She denied facial numbness or weakness, and reported no dizziness or vertigo. Physical examination revealed a retrotympanic, nonpulsatile, tan-gray mass anterior to the malleus handle. A tuning fork examination revealed lateralization to the left ear and bone conduction louder than air conduction on the left side with a 512-Hz tuning fork. The remainder of the physical examination, including facial nerve function, was normal. An audiogram confirmed mild conductive hearing loss in the left ear. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a middle ear lesion lateral to the geniculate ganglion with possible extension into the peritubal space. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an enhancing lesion lateral to the geniculate ganglion (Figure, A-C). The patient was initially observed but then experienced progressive hearing loss that no longer improved with the Valsalva maneuver, persistent ear fullness, and rare facial twitching. The middle ear mass appeared enlarged on repeated MRI and began to obstruct the eustachian tube. Transcanal endoscopy demonstrated a gray middle ear mass occupying the anterior mesotympanum and epitympanum and extending into the eustachian tube (Figure, D). The tegmen was intact. The specimen revealed predominantly spindled stroma with a focus of tumor that was positive for antiepithelial membrane antigen and somatostatin receptor 2A.

A facial nerve venous malformation is a rare congenital anomaly that is characterized by the presence of a venous channel within the facial nerve canal. This condition is usually asymptomatic, but it can occasionally present with symptoms such as facial pain, numbness, or weakness. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be indicated in some cases.

A jugulotympanic paraganglioma is a rare tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small collections of cells that are found in the head and neck. These tumors are usually benign, but they can occasionally be malignant. Jugulotympanic paragangliomas typically present with symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial paralysis. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually involves surgery, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy in some cases.

A middle ear adenoma is a rare tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the middle ear. These tumors are usually benign, but they can occasionally be malignant. Middle ear adenomas typically present with symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial paralysis. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually involves surgery, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy in some cases.

In the case presented above, the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging studies are most consistent with the diagnosis of primary middle ear meningioma. Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. These tumors are usually benign, but they can occasionally be malignant. Meningiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skull and spine. The most common symptom of a meningioma is headache. Other symptoms may include seizures, vision problems, and numbness or weakness in the arms or legs. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually involves surgery, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy in some cases.

Dermoid cysts (mature teratomas) are congenital tumors that are composed of tissues from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). They are most common in the head and neck region, and can occur in any location within the nasal cavity. Dermoid cysts are typically benign, but can rarely become malignant.

Gliomas are tumors that arise from glial cells, which are the cells that support and protect neurons in the brain. Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor, and can occur in any age group. Gliomas are typically malignant, and the prognosis for patients with gliomas is poor.

Encephaloceles are congenital malformations that are characterized by the protrusion of brain tissue and meninges through a defect in the skull. Encephaloceles can occur anywhere along the midline of the skull, but are most common in the occipital region. Encephaloceles are typically benign, but can rarely become infected or cause hydrocephalus.

In the case presented, the patient is a newborn twin girl with a left-sided nasal mass causing nasal obstruction and difficulty breathing. The mass was present at birth, and the patient has always seemed congested on the left side. There is no report of clear drainage. Physical examination shows an approximately 1-cm, firm, pedunculated polypoid mass in the anterior nasal cavity at the vestibule. The base is located just anterior to the septum and encompasses nearly the entire left nasal cavity. There is no fluid in the mass, and there is a negative Furstenberg sign. Nasal endoscopy was performed in the clinic, and there were no additional masses or mucosal abnormalities. The choana was patent. The patient was also noted to have left eye ptosis and left preauricular branchial remnants but no other significant abnormalities on examination. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed and showed a 0.8 × 0.5–cm hyperintense mass on T1-weighted images, suggesting a fatty component and no intracranial tract.

The history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of hairy polyp. Hairy polyps are benign tumors that arise from the nasal mucosa. They are most common in children, but can occur in adults as well. Hairy polyps are typically pedunculated and have a smooth, papillary surface. They are often covered in hair, which is why they are called hairy polyps. Hairy polyps are typically asymptomatic, but can cause nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Dermoid cysts (mature teratomas) are typically not pedunculated and do not have a smooth, papillary surface. They are also not typically covered in hair.
* Gliomas are typically not pedunculated and do not have a smooth, papillary surface. They are also not typically covered in hair.
* Encephaloceles are typically not pedunculated and do not have a smooth, papillary surface. They are also not typically covered in hair.

People with XP have defective DNA repair mechanisms, which makes them more susceptible to skin cancer. The most common type of skin cancer in people with XP is basal cell carcinoma, which is the type of tumor that the patient in the case report had.

Trichothiodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the hair, skin, and nails. People with trichothiodystrophy have fragile, brittle hair, dry, scaly skin, and short, curved nails. They are also more likely to develop skin cancer, but this is not as common as in people with XP.

Cockayne syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the body and brain. People with Cockayne syndrome are usually short in stature and have a characteristic facial appearance. They may also have hearing loss, vision problems, and intellectual disability. Cockayne syndrome is not associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.

Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin lesion that is caused by sun exposure. Actinic keratoses are usually small, scaly lesions that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, hands, and forearms. They can be treated with topical medications or laser therapy. Actinic keratoses are not usually associated with an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in the case report is xeroderma pigmentosum. This is because the patient has a history of sun-exposed skin lesions that have developed into tumors, and he has a family history of the disorder.

VEGF-D is a protein that is produced by endothelial cells, which are the cells that line the blood vessels. It is a growth factor, which means that it helps to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. VEGF-D is also involved in the development of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a rare lung disease that is characterized by the growth of abnormal smooth muscle cells in the lungs.

The patient in the case study has a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. She is a young woman, which is the typical age group for the disease. She has shortness of breath with exertion, which is a common symptom of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. She also has a high level of VEGF-D in her blood, which is a marker of the disease.

While a lung biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing lymphangioleiomyomatosis, it is not always necessary. In cases where the patient has a high level of VEGF-D in their blood and other features that are consistent with the disease, a diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis can be made without a lung biopsy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. The VEGF-D level is nonspecific and the patient should undergo further evaluation with a lung biopsy. This is not the correct answer because the patient already has a high level of VEGF-D in their blood, which is a marker of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. A lung biopsy is not always necessary in cases where the patient has a high level of VEGF-D in their blood and other features that are consistent with the disease.
* B. The VEGF-D level is supportive of a diagnosis of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any of the features that are typically associated with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare lung disease that is characterized by the infiltration of the lungs with Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The patient in the case study does not have any of the typical symptoms of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, such as cough, chest pain, or fever.
* D. The VEGF-D level indicates that the patient should undergo folliculin gene test for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any of the features that are typically associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple tumors, including lung cysts. The patient in the case study does not have any of the typical symptoms of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, such as skin lesions, kidney stones, or tumors.

IgG4-related disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of IgG4-positive plasma cells and infiltration of IgG4-containing inflammatory cells in various organs. The most common manifestations are lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancreatic involvement. Other organs that may be involved include the kidneys, lungs, skin, and eyes.

The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Laboratory tests that may be helpful include serum IgG4 levels, IgG4 subclass levels, and IgG4-specific antibody titers. Imaging studies that may be helpful include computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

The treatment of IgG4-related disease is based on the severity of the disease and the organs involved. Treatment may include corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents, and surgery.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of oral cancer, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's medical history of refractory leukemia and pancytopenia puts him at increased risk for developing mucormycosis, a fungal infection that can be life-threatening in immunocompromised patients. The patient's clinical presentation, including rapidly growing, severely painful oral lesions, is also consistent with mucormycosis. The histopathologic findings of the sloughed fragment of affected tissue, which showed fungal hyphae with broad, nonseptate branching, are diagnostic of mucormycosis. The CT scan findings, which showed tissue enlargement in the left hard palate and maxillary sinus, are also consistent with mucormycosis.

Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can cause pulmonary, sinus, and disseminated disease. It is not as common as mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients, and it does not typically present with the same clinical features. The histopathologic findings of aspergillosis are also different from those of mucormycosis.

Myeloid sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can arise in the bone marrow or soft tissues. It is not a likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection of the skin that causes white or discolored patches. It is most common in adolescents and young adults, and is more common in warm, humid climates. The lesions of tinea versicolor are often scaly and may be itchy.

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder that causes the loss of pigment in the skin. It can occur anywhere on the body, but is most common on the hands, feet, face, and lips. The lesions of vitiligo are often sharply demarcated and may be surrounded by a halo of hyperpigmentation.

Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis is a common, benign condition that causes small, white spots on the skin. The lesions of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

The patient in the case presented with multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. The lesions were well-demarcated and hypopigmented, and there was no history of any systemic disorder or family history of similar lesions. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide did not reveal hyphae, and Wood light examination revealed no accentuation. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation, which revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis. The clear cells were larger than the neighboring keratinocytes and contained abundant pale cytoplasm.

The clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and negative findings on direct microscopic examination and Wood light examination are all consistent with a diagnosis of clear cell papulosis. Clear cell papulosis is a rare, benign condition that typically presents in childhood or adolescence. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, if the lesions are cosmetically disfiguring, they may be treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids.

Tinea versicolor is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because the patient does not have any of the typical clinical features of the disease, such as scaly, itchy lesions. Additionally, the direct microscopic examination and Wood light examination were negative for hyphae, which are characteristic findings of tinea versicolor.

Vitiligo is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because the patient does not have any of the typical clinical features of the disease, such as sharply demarcated lesions surrounded by a halo of hyperpigmentation. Additionally, the patient has a history of the lesions being present at birth, which is not typical of vitiligo.

Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because the patient has a history of the lesions being present at birth, which is not typical of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis. Additionally, the patient has multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented lesions, which are not typical of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of necrotizing granulomas and vasculitis. The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis).
* Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, skin, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas and dissemination of the fungus to other organs. The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with histoplasmosis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

 41%|████      | 619/1525 [2:33:01<4:08:14, 16.44s/it]The correct answer is B. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP). SEP is a rare, chronic, fibrosing disease of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and organs. It is characterized by the formation of thick, fibrous tissue that can cause adhesions, obstruction of the small bowel, and ascites. The exact cause of SEP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

The patient in the case presentation presents with several features that are consistent with SEP. He is a middle-aged man of West African descent, which are risk factors for SEP. He has a history of prostate cancer, which can be associated with SEP. He has been experiencing progressive worsening postprandial nausea or vomiting, epigastric abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss of 27 kg. These symptoms are consistent with the chronic, progressive nature of SEP. He has also had a previous laparotomy and lysis of small adhesive bands for adhesive small bowel obstruction. This is a common complication of SEP. His abdominal computed tomography scan showed markedly dilated stomach and duodenum with decompressed, thickened distal small bowel without a clear transition point. This is also consistent with SEP.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A. Abdominal tuberculosis is a common cause of chronic abdominal pain, but it is not typically associated with the other features that the patient in the case presentation is experiencing. C. Adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common cause of acute abdominal pain, but it is not typically associated with the patient's chronic symptoms. D. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a common cause of ascites, but it is not typically associated with the patient's other symptoms.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with SEP.

 41%|████      | 620/1525 [2:33:16<4:00:05, 15.92s/it]The correct answer is D. Infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula. The patient's history of aortoiliac surgery, his recent tooth extraction, and his fever, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers are all consistent with an infection of the aortic graft. The CT scan shows a fluid collection around the graft, which is a characteristic finding of an infected graft. The other choices are less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Carcinoma in the body of the pancreas is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms or signs of pancreatic cancer. Advanced carcinoma of the duodenum is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms or signs of duodenal cancer. Posterior perforation of a duodenal ulcer is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms or signs of a duodenal ulcer.

Infection of an aortic graft is a serious complication that can lead to graft failure, sepsis, and death. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and removal of the infected graft.

 41%|████      | 621/1525 [2:33:26<3:35:37, 14.31s/it]The correct answer is C. Check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels.

The patient in the case has bilateral choroidal lesions, which are associated with a number of conditions, including hyperparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and Fahr's disease. These conditions are all characterized by elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, or calcium. Therefore, the first step in the evaluation of a patient with choroidal lesions is to check these levels.

A transvitreous biopsy is not necessary in this case because the clinical presentation is consistent with a metabolic disorder. A transvitreous biopsy is a surgical procedure that is used to diagnose inflammatory conditions of the eye. It is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of inflammation.

Oral corticosteroid therapy is not necessary in this case because the clinical presentation is consistent with a metabolic disorder. Oral corticosteroid therapy is used to treat inflammatory conditions of the eye. It is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of inflammation.

Plaque brachytherapy is not necessary in this case because the clinical presentation is consistent with a metabolic disorder. Plaque brachytherapy is a radiation therapy procedure that is used to treat choroidal tumors. It is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have a choroidal tumor.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels. The other choices are incorrect because they are not indicated in the management of a patient with choroidal lesions.

 41%|████      | 622/1525 [2:33:43<3:45:59, 15.02s/it]The correct answer is "C": Order mitochondrial genetic testing.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), an inherited mitochondrial disorder that causes progressive bilateral optic atrophy. The most common mutation in LHON is a homoplasmic variant in ND6 (m.14484T>C), which is present in approximately 90% of cases.

Other causes of progressive bilateral optic atrophy, such as autoimmune retinopathy, toxic optic neuropathy, and nutritional optic neuropathy, are less likely in this patient given his age, medical history, and negative laboratory tests.

SD-OCT segmentation can be used to assess the thickness of retinal layers, but it is not specific for LHON. Asking about antihypertensives taken in the evening, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular risk factors would be appropriate if the patient had a history of these conditions, but they are not likely to be the cause of his visual loss in this case.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to order mitochondrial genetic testing. If the test is positive, the patient may be eligible for treatment with coenzyme Q10 or other mitochondrial therapies.

 41%|████      | 623/1525 [2:33:58<3:44:56, 14.96s/it]The correct answer is B. Order a hormone profile (thyrotropin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone, and testosterone) and consult endocrinology.

The patient presents with a number of symptoms that are suggestive of a hormonal disorder, including short stature, hypochondroplasia, alopecia, and diabetes insipidus. A hormone profile can help to identify the specific hormone that is deficient or in excess. This information can then be used to determine the best course of treatment.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is not necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a brain tumor or other structural abnormality. A peripheral blood smear examination is also not necessary. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a blood disorder. Targeted genetic testing is not necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a genetic disorder.

The best course of action is to order a hormone profile and consult an endocrinologist. The endocrinologist will be able to interpret the results of the hormone profile and recommend the best course of treatment.

 41%|████      | 624/1525 [2:34:15<3:52:31, 15.48s/it]The correct answer is D. Review medications.

The patient's history of long-standing hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease suggests that she may be taking multiple medications that could be contributing to her vision loss. A review of her medications would help to identify any potential culprits and allow for appropriate adjustments to be made.

Genetic testing is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with any known genetic disorders. Order antiretinal antibodies is also not indicated because there is no evidence that the patient has an autoimmune disorder. Perform systemic evaluation for malignancy is not indicated because there is no evidence that the patient has cancer.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Review medications. A review of the patient's medications is the most appropriate next step in the management of her vision loss.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

A. Perform genetic testing: Genetic testing is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with any known genetic disorders. The patient has a history of long-standing hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease. These conditions are not typically associated with genetic disorders. Additionally, the patient's vision loss is not progressive, which is another characteristic of genetic disorders. Therefore, there is no reason to suspect that the patient has a genetic disorder and genetic testing would not be helpful in the management of her vision loss.

B. Order antiretinal antibodies: Order antiretinal antibodies is also not indicated because there is no evidence that the patient has an autoimmune disorder. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with any known autoimmune disorders. Additionally, the patient's vision loss is not progressive, which is another characteristic of autoimmune disorders. Therefore, there is no reason to suspect that the patient has an autoimmune disorder and ordering antiretinal antibodies would not be helpful in the management of her vision loss.

C. Perform systemic evaluation for malignancy: Perform systemic evaluation for malignancy is not indicated because there is no evidence that the patient has cancer. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with any known cancers. Additionally, the patient's vision loss is not progressive, which is another characteristic of cancer. Therefore, there is no reason to suspect that the patient has cancer and performing a systemic evaluation for malignancy would not be helpful in the management of her vision loss.

D. Review medications: Review medications is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient's vision loss because the patient's history of long-standing hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease suggests that she may be taking multiple medications that could be contributing to her vision loss. A review of her medications would help to identify any potential culprits and allow for appropriate adjustments to be made.

 41%|████      | 625/1525 [2:34:26<3:32:39, 14.18s/it]The correct answer is C. Another MRI scan of the orbit.

The patient has a history of optic disc edema and double vision. He has also experienced graying of vision on rightward gaze. His best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the right eye. There was prominent chronic-appearing optic disc edema in the right eye without abnormalities in the left eye. Results of visual field testing showed superior greater than inferior peripheral field loss in the right eye and normal visual field in the left eye.

A lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of meningitis or other central nervous system infection. Risk factor modification is also not indicated because the patient's only risk factor is hypertension. Corticosteroids are not indicated without further evidence of an inflammatory process.

Another MRI scan of the orbit is the best next step because it will help to determine the cause of the patient's optic disc edema. The initial MRI scan was normal, but the patient's symptoms have progressed. The new MRI scan may show evidence of a mass lesion, such as a tumor or an abscess. It may also show evidence of inflammation, such as optic neuritis.

If the MRI scan is normal, the patient may need to be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation. If the MRI scan shows evidence of a mass lesion, the patient may need to be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. If the MRI scan shows evidence of inflammation, the patient may need to be treated with corticosteroids.

 41%|████      | 626/1525 [2:34:42<3:41:44, 14.80s/it]The correct answer is B. Order a complete blood cell count.

The patient is a middle-aged man with bilateral subretinal fluid. Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) is the most common cause of unilateral subretinal fluid, but it is very rare to have bilateral CSR. In addition, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with any of the other causes of bilateral subretinal fluid, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or syphilis.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a simple blood test that can help to rule out some of the other possible causes of bilateral subretinal fluid. For example, an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) could suggest an infection, such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) could suggest an inflammatory condition, such as sarcoidosis or vasculitis.

Ordering a CBC is a safe and relatively inexpensive way to rule out some of the other possible causes of bilateral subretinal fluid. If the CBC is normal, then the next step would be to order further tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, to look for other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Order tests for syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis; if results are negative, start treatment with oral corticosteroids. This is not the correct next step because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with any of these conditions.
* C. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This is not the correct next step because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with any of the conditions that would require MRI, such as a brain tumor or a mass lesion in the orbit.
* D. Observe the patient; offer photodynamic therapy if the subretinal fluid persists for 3 months. This is not the correct next step because the patient's symptoms are acute and worsening. It is not appropriate to wait 3 months to see if the patient's symptoms improve.

 41%|████      | 627/1525 [2:34:55<3:33:42, 14.28s/it]The correct answer is B. Follicular lymphoma.

Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that usually presents with patches or plaques on the skin. It is not associated with lymphadenopathy or abdominal pain.

Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that typically presents with flat-topped, purple papules. It is not associated with lymphadenopathy or abdominal pain.

Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can involve the skin. However, it is not typically associated with a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion.

Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can involve the skin. It is the most common type of lymphoma in the elderly. The patient in this case is a 67-year-old man with a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion, weight loss, and abdominal pain. These findings are consistent with follicular lymphoma. The biopsy specimen from the skin lesion shows a diffuse infiltrate of small lymphocytes with follicular colonization. This is a characteristic finding of follicular lymphoma.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.
It is reasoning
 41%|████      | 628/1525 [2:35:11<3:39:02, 14.65s/it]The correct answer is C. Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified.

The patient has inferior ST-segment elevation, which is a sign of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The most common cause of MI is a blockage in a coronary artery, which supplies blood to the heart muscle. The goal of treatment is to restore blood flow to the heart muscle as quickly as possible.

In this case, the patient has a history of remote percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a procedure to open a blocked coronary artery. However, the details of the PCI are not available, so it is not known which coronary artery was treated. It is possible that the culprit artery, which is the artery that is blocked, is different from the artery that was treated during the PCI.

The next step in management is to pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified. This can be done with coronary angiography, which is a procedure that uses X-rays to visualize the coronary arteries. If the culprit artery is identified, it can be treated with PCI or other procedures.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the immediate need to restore blood flow to the heart muscle. Performing coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) would be appropriate if the LAD was the culprit artery. However, the LAD is not the only artery that can cause MI, and it is not known if the LAD is the culprit artery in this case. Determining the severity of the LAD plaque by measuring fractional flow reserve would not be helpful in this case, as it would not provide information about the culprit artery. Ordering urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) would not be helpful in this case, as CTA is not a good test for identifying coronary artery blockages.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified. This is the best way to restore blood flow to the heart muscle and prevent further damage.

 41%|████      | 629/1525 [2:35:22<3:23:14, 13.61s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration.

The patient in the case has an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and liver masses. AFP is a protein that is produced by the fetal liver and yolk sac. It is also produced by some types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The presence of an elevated AFP level in a patient with liver masses is highly suggestive of HCC.

The patient also has a pancreatic mass. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It is a very aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. The most common symptoms of pancreatic cancer are abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a tissue diagnosis of the pancreatic mass. This can be done with an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). EUS is a procedure that uses a combination of ultrasound and endoscopy to visualize the pancreas and other organs in the abdomen. A fine needle is then inserted through the endoscope and into the mass to obtain a sample of tissue. This tissue sample can then be analyzed under a microscope to determine whether it is cancerous.

FNA is a safe and effective procedure for obtaining a tissue diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. It is more accurate than other methods, such as CT-guided biopsy, and it is less invasive than surgery.

Once a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has been made, the patient can be started on appropriate treatment. The treatment of pancreatic cancer depends on the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Begin FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy is not the next step in the management of this patient because the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has not been confirmed. Chemotherapy is a treatment option for pancreatic cancer, but it is not started until after a tissue diagnosis has been made.
* B. Begin sorafenib is not the next step in the management of this patient because the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has not been confirmed. Sorafenib is a targeted therapy that is used to treat advanced pancreatic cancer. It is not started until after a tissue diagnosis has been made.
* C. Perform a fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan is not the next step in the management of this patient because the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has not been confirmed. A PET scan is a test that is used to detect cancer. It is not started until after a tissue diagnosis has been made.

A. Aggressive invasive thyroid cancer is incorrect because the patient did not have any symptoms of metastatic disease, such as lymphadenopathy or bone pain. In addition, the imaging studies showed that the mass was located in the trachea, which is not a common site for metastasis from thyroid cancer.

B. Amyloidosis is incorrect because the patient did not have any of the classic symptoms of amyloidosis, such as nephrotic syndrome or macroglossia. In addition, the imaging studies did not show any evidence of amyloid deposition in the thyroid gland.

C. Benign thyroid rest is the correct answer because the patient had a history of thyroid cancer and the imaging studies showed that the mass was located in the trachea and was contiguous with the thyroid gland. In addition, the biopsy specimen from the mass showed benign thyroid tissue.

D. Mucoid pseudotumor is incorrect because the patient did not have any of the classic symptoms of mucoid pseudotumor, such as hoarseness or dysphagia. In addition, the imaging studies did not show any evidence of a cystic mass in the trachea.

 41%|████▏     | 631/1525 [2:35:54<3:44:10, 15.05s/it]The correct diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, sinuses, kidneys, and other organs. The patient's history of pulmonary embolism, sinus congestion and headaches, and diplopia and blurry vision are all consistent with GPA. The CT and MRI scans showed abnormal soft tissue throughout the sinuses with destruction of the sinus walls and skull base, as well as extension of abnormal appearing tissue into the right orbital apex and posterior nasal septum. These findings are also consistent with GPA. The laboratory evaluation showed a normal white blood cell count, but an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. These findings are non-specific, but can be seen in patients with GPA. The nasal endoscopy showed bloody mucus and crusting around the right middle turbinate and sphenoethmoidal recess. This finding is also consistent with GPA. The frozen sections revealed negative results for fungal elements and cellular dysplasia, but demonstrated widespread inflammation with giant cells. This finding is highly suggestive of GPA. The final pathology slide showed numerous multinucleated giant cells, necrosis, and inflammatory cells invading vessel walls. These findings are all characteristic of GPA.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is not a vasculitis and would not cause the patient's symptoms.

Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is a fungal infection of the sinuses. It is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer or HIV/AIDS. The patient's history does not suggest that she has a weakened immune system, and the CT and MRI scans did not show any evidence of fungal infection.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the lining of the sinuses. It is more common in men than women, and usually occurs in people over the age of 50. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that she has sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

 41%|████▏     | 632/1525 [2:36:09<3:42:05, 14.92s/it]The correct diagnosis is extranodal T-cell lymphoma. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient is a 32-year-old Hispanic man, which is the age and ethnic group that is most commonly affected by extranodal T-cell lymphoma.
* The patient has a history of nasal pain and swelling that has been progressive for 6 weeks. This is a typical presentation of extranodal T-cell lymphoma.
* The patient was hospitalized for this problem at an outside hospital and treated with antibiotics, without improvement. This suggests that the infection is not bacterial, but rather a malignancy.
* The patient developed difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage. These are all common symptoms of extranodal T-cell lymphoma.
* On presentation, the patient was afebrile without leukocytosis. This suggests that the infection is not acute, but rather a chronic process.
* Physical examination demonstrated diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extended to above his upper lip. This is a classic presentation of extranodal T-cell lymphoma.
* Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. This is a typical finding on CT imaging in patients with extranodal T-cell lymphoma.
* After bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, axial postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging through the nasal cavity demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images. No intracranial or intraorbital disease extension was noted. This is also a typical finding on MRI imaging in patients with extranodal T-cell lymphoma.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of extranodal T-cell lymphoma. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation as well as extranodal T-cell lymphoma does.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis are both autoimmune diseases that can cause nasal inflammation and swelling. However, they are typically associated with other systemic symptoms, such as fever, rash, and joint pain, which the patient does not have. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to the nose. However, it is not typically associated with nasal pain and swelling that is progressive for 6 weeks. Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious bacterial infection that can cause rapid tissue death. However, it is typically associated with fever, chills, and systemic toxicity, which the patient does not have.

 42%|████▏     | 633/1525 [2:36:26<3:49:59, 15.47s/it]The correct answer is D. Myositis ossificans. Myositis ossificans is a rare, non-cancerous condition in which bone forms in the soft tissues of the body. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and is thought to be caused by an injury to the muscle. The most common symptom is a painful, swollen mass in the affected area. The diagnosis is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans. Treatment typically involves rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the ossified mass.

Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that arises from the growth plate of a long bone. It is the most common type of bone tumor in children and adolescents. Osteochondromas are usually solitary tumors, but they can occur in multiple bones (multiple hereditary osteochondromas). The most common symptom of an osteochondroma is a painless mass on a bone. Osteochondromas are usually diagnosed on X-rays. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be recommended if the tumor is causing pain or problems with movement.

Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that is characterized by a small, painful mass. Osteoid osteomas are most common in adolescents and young adults. The most common symptom is a dull, aching pain that is worse at night. Osteoid osteomas are usually diagnosed on X-rays. Treatment is usually with surgery to remove the tumor.

Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that is the most common type of bone cancer. Osteosarcomas are most common in adolescents and young adults. The most common symptom is pain and swelling in a bone. Osteosarcomas are usually diagnosed on X-rays. Treatment is usually with surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is myositis ossificans. This is supported by the patient's history of a motor vehicle accident, the presence of a painful, swollen mass in the left posterior triangle of the neck, and the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed ossified lesion in the soft tissue of the neck. Osteochondroma, osteoid osteoma, and osteosarcoma are all less likely diagnoses in this patient.

 42%|████▏     | 634/1525 [2:36:42<3:52:12, 15.64s/it]The correct answer is D. Initiate negative-pressure isolation.

The patient in the case has a fever, rash, and abnormal liver function test results. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the liver. It is spread through contact with blood or body fluids that contain the virus.

The patient's symptoms suggest that he is in the early stages of the infection. He is at risk of developing complications, such as liver failure, if the infection is not treated.

Negative-pressure isolation is a procedure that is used to prevent the spread of airborne infections. It is done by creating a negative pressure environment in a room or area. This means that the air in the room is constantly being sucked out and replaced with fresh air from outside.

Negative-pressure isolation is the most effective way to prevent the spread of airborne infections. It is recommended for patients who have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of an airborne infection.

The other options are incorrect because they are not necessary or appropriate for the patient in the case.

Option A, Administer an intravenous steroid, is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient needs steroids. Steroids are used to treat inflammation, but the patient's symptoms are not caused by inflammation.

Option B, Obtain an HIV immunoassay, is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient has HIV. HIV is a virus that can cause AIDS. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with HIV infection.

Option C, Perform liver biopsy, is incorrect because a liver biopsy is not necessary to diagnose hepatitis B. Hepatitis B can be diagnosed with blood tests.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Initiate negative-pressure isolation. This is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the patient's infection.

 42%|████▏     | 635/1525 [2:36:58<3:54:29, 15.81s/it]The correct answer is D. The patient has warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys red blood cells. This can lead to anemia, which is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues.

The most common symptom of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is fatigue. Other symptoms may include pallor (pale skin), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and shortness of breath.

The diagnosis of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is based on a physical examination, blood tests, and a bone marrow biopsy. Blood tests will show an elevated level of bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells. The bone marrow biopsy will show an increase in the number of immature red blood cells.

There is no cure for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but the condition can be managed with medication. Treatment may include corticosteroids, such as prednisone, or immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. In some cases, a splenectomy, or removal of the spleen, may be necessary.

The prognosis for patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia varies depending on the severity of the disease. With treatment, most patients can live a normal life. However, some patients may experience complications, such as kidney failure or heart problems.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

A. The patient does not have cold agglutinin disease, which is a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia that is caused by antibodies that bind to red blood cells at cold temperatures.

B. The patient does not have pure red cell aplasia, which is a rare condition in which the body stops producing red blood cells.

C. The patient does not have undergone Richter transformation, which is a rare complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in which the disease transforms into a more aggressive form of leukemia.

 42%|████▏     | 636/1525 [2:37:14<3:56:38, 15.97s/it]The correct answer is B. Continue medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy.

The patient in this case has a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This is a type of heart attack that occurs when there is a blockage in a coronary artery, but the blockage does not cause ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG). NSTEMIs are usually treated with medical therapy, which includes a β-blocker, an antiplatelet drug, and a statin.

A β-blocker is a type of medication that helps to lower blood pressure and heart rate. It can also help to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack. An antiplatelet drug is a type of medication that helps to prevent blood clots. A statin is a type of medication that helps to lower cholesterol levels.

In this case, the patient has already been started on aspirin and ticagrelor, which are both antiplatelet drugs. She has also been started on metoprolol tartrate, which is a β-blocker. These medications are all appropriate for the treatment of NSTEMI.

There is no evidence that thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery would be beneficial for this patient. Thrombolytic therapy is a type of medication that is used to dissolve blood clots. PCI is a procedure that is used to open up a blocked coronary artery. CABG surgery is a procedure that is used to bypass a blocked coronary artery.

Thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for patients with NSTEMI because it does not improve outcomes. PCI is not recommended for patients with NSTEMI who have a small area of ischemia on their ECG. CABG surgery is not recommended for patients with NSTEMI who are not at high risk for death.

Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is to continue medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy.

 42%|████▏     | 637/1525 [2:37:28<3:47:51, 15.40s/it]The correct answer is B. The patient has acute kidney injury most likely related to sepsis.

The patient's serum creatinine increased from 0.7 mg/dL to 1.5 mg/dL, which is a significant increase. The patient also has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output is low, which is another sign of acute kidney injury. The patient's blood pressure is low, which is a sign of sepsis. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that can lead to acute kidney injury.

The other choices are incorrect. The change in serum creatinine is not within the coefficient of variation. The patient does not have prerenal azotemia. There are sufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each choice:

A. The change in serum creatinine is within the coefficient of variation.

The coefficient of variation is a measure of the variability of a set of data. In this case, the coefficient of variation for serum creatinine is 10%. This means that a change in serum creatinine of 10% or less is considered to be within the normal range. The patient's serum creatinine increased from 0.7 mg/dL to 1.5 mg/dL, which is a change of 100%. This is a significant increase and is not within the normal range.

B. The patient has acute kidney injury most likely related to sepsis.

Acute kidney injury is a sudden decrease in kidney function. It can be caused by a number of factors, including sepsis. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that can lead to organ failure, including kidney failure. The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for acute kidney injury, including a history of hypertension, low urine output, and low blood pressure. The patient also has a clinical presentation consistent with sepsis.

C. The patient has prerenal azotemia.

Prerenal azotemia is a condition in which the kidneys are not receiving enough blood flow. This can be caused by a number of factors, including dehydration, heart failure, and liver failure. The patient in this case does not have any of the risk factors for prerenal azotemia. The patient's urine output is low, but the patient's blood pressure is normal. This suggests that the patient's kidneys are receiving enough blood flow.

D. There are insufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how well the kidneys are filtering waste products from the blood. The GFR can be measured in a number of ways, including a blood test and a kidney biopsy. The patient in this case has not had a GFR measurement. Therefore, there is insufficient data to conclude that the patient has a decrease in GFR.

Familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent blisters and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes. It is not associated with violaceous patches.

Fixed drug eruption is a type of allergic reaction that occurs when a person is exposed to a certain medication. It is characterized by well-defined, round or oval lesions that are often painful and itchy. The lesions may be red, brown, or purple, and they may blister or ooze. Fixed drug eruption is not associated with violaceous patches.

Erythrasma is a fungal infection of the skin that is often seen in intertriginous areas, such as the armpits and groin. It is characterized by scaling, erythematous patches that may have a brown or blackish discoloration. Erythrasma is not associated with violaceous patches.

Inverse lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by violaceous, flat-topped papules and plaques. It is often found in intertriginous areas, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. Inverse lichen planus can be very pruritic.

The patient in the case presented with a 3-month history of discrete, dark red, circular lesions in his right axilla. He endorsed severe pruritus at these sites that would wake him up at night. He denied any recent trauma or history of similar lesions. He denied associated pain, blisters, or systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills). His medical history was unremarkable, and he noted no environmental triggers or new medications. Treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, ketoconazole cream, and discontinuation of underarm deodorant yielded no improvement. Physical examination revealed 3 well-circumscribed, violaceous, annular patches without scale or erosion that are limited to his right axilla. No other lesions were noted on his skin or mucous membranes. A Wood lamp examination was negative. A punch biopsy specimen from a lesion was obtained, which showed lymphocytes obscuring the dermal-epidermal junction.

The patient's presentation is consistent with inverse lichen planus. The violaceous, flat-topped papules and plaques are characteristic of the condition. The pruritus is also a common symptom. The fact that the lesions are limited to the right axilla is also consistent with inverse lichen planus, which is often found in intertriginous areas. The Wood lamp examination was negative, which rules out erythrasma. The biopsy specimen showed lymphocytes obscuring the dermal-epidermal junction, which is a classic finding in inverse lichen planus.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Inverse lichen planus.

OHL is a white, corrugated lesion that is most commonly seen on the lateral borders of the tongue. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a herpesvirus that is usually latent in the body after primary infection. OHL is most commonly seen in people with HIV/AIDS, but it can also occur in people who are not immunocompromised.

The other three choices are incorrect. Oral frictional keratosis is a common benign lesion that is caused by chronic irritation of the oral mucosa. It is usually seen on the lateral borders of the tongue and the buccal mucosa. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa that is characterized by white, lace-like lesions. It is not caused by a virus and is not associated with HIV/AIDS. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the oral mucosa. It is the most common type of oral cancer and is most commonly seen in people who smoke or use tobacco products.

The following are the reasons why C. Oral hairy leukoplakia is the correct answer while the rest choices are incorrect:

* Oral hairy leukoplakia is a white, corrugated lesion that is most commonly seen on the lateral borders of the tongue. This is consistent with the patient's presentation.
* Oral hairy leukoplakia is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a herpesvirus that is usually latent in the body after primary infection. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, which is a condition that is associated with EBV reactivation.

 42%|████▏     | 640/1525 [2:38:13<3:45:38, 15.30s/it]The correct answer is A. Pigmented onychomatricoma.

Pigmented onychomatricoma is a rare benign tumor of the nail matrix. It is characterized by a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate that extends to the proximal nail fold. The pigment is usually the same width throughout the band and is not associated with any other nail or skin lesions.

Subungual melanoma is a malignant tumor of the nail matrix. It is the most common type of melanoma that affects the nails. It is characterized by a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate that is often associated with other nail or skin lesions, such as nail thickening, splinter hemorrhages, and Hutchinson's sign (a pigmented band that extends from the nail plate to the proximal nail fold).

Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precancerous condition of the nail matrix. It is characterized by a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate that is often associated with other nail or skin lesions, such as nail thickening, splinter hemorrhages, and Hutchinson's sign.

Pigmented onychopapilloma is a benign tumor of the nail bed. It is characterized by a small, raised, pigmented lesion on the nail bed. The lesion is usually not associated with any other nail or skin lesions.

In the case presented, the patient has a dark brown longitudinal pigment band on the second toenail that extends to the proximal nail fold. The pigment is the same width throughout the band and is not associated with any other nail or skin lesions. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pigmented onychomatricoma.

Subungual melanoma is a more serious condition that can be life-threatening. It is important to rule out subungual melanoma in any patient with a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate. However, the patient in the case presented does not have any of the risk factors for subungual melanoma, such as a family history of melanoma or a history of sun exposure. Additionally, the lesion in the case presented is not associated with any other nail or skin lesions, which makes it less likely to be subungual melanoma.

Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precancerous condition that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. It is important to treat pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ to prevent it from developing into squamous cell carcinoma. However, the patient in the case presented does not have any of the risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, such as a family history of squamous cell carcinoma or a history of sun exposure. Additionally, the lesion in the case presented is not associated with any other nail or skin lesions, which makes it less likely to be pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ.

Pigmented onychopapilloma is a benign condition that does not require treatment. However, it is important to rule out other, more serious conditions, such as subungual melanoma, before making a diagnosis of pigmented onychopapilloma.

 42%|████▏     | 641/1525 [2:38:28<3:45:13, 15.29s/it]The correct answer is C. Clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention.

The patient in this case presents with mild mental health problems, including social withdrawal, a drop in functioning, and a vague feeling of perplexity and derealization. These symptoms are concerning, but they do not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder. In addition, the patient has no family history of mental disorders and denies any current or past use of drugs.

Given the lack of clear diagnostic criteria and the patient's good physical health, the best course of action is to provide clinical follow-up for at least 3 years. This will allow the patient to be monitored for any changes in his mental health status and to receive appropriate treatment if needed. In addition, the patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of mental illness and encouraged to seek help if he experiences any worsening of his symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, discharge to general practitioner with no clinical recommendations, is incorrect because the patient's mental health problems are not mild enough to be managed by a primary care physician.
* Option B, pharmacotherapy with low-dose atypical antipsychotics, is incorrect because the patient does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder that would warrant treatment with antipsychotic medication.
* Option D, treatment with ω-3 fish oil dietary supplementation, is incorrect because there is no evidence that this treatment is effective for the patient's symptoms.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention. This will allow the patient to be monitored for any changes in his mental health status and to receive appropriate treatment if needed. In addition, the patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of mental illness and encouraged to seek help if he experiences any worsening of his symptoms.

 42%|████▏     | 642/1525 [2:38:45<3:50:23, 15.65s/it]The correct diagnosis is C. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and pyramidal signs. It is caused by mutations in the SACS gene, which encodes a protein called sacsin. Sacsin is involved in the transport of proteins within the cell, and its mutation leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cerebellum and other parts of the nervous system.

The clinical features of ARSACS typically begin in childhood or adolescence. The most common symptoms are ataxia, spasticity, and pyramidal signs. Ataxia is a loss of coordination, which can make it difficult to walk, talk, or use fine motor skills. Spasticity is a stiffness of the muscles, which can make it difficult to move. Pyramidal signs are signs of damage to the upper motor neurons, which control voluntary movement. These signs can include hyperreflexia (increased reflexes), clonus (rapid, involuntary muscle contractions), and Babinski's sign (an upward movement of the big toe when the sole of the foot is stroked).

Other symptoms of ARSACS can include nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), and optic atrophy (degeneration of the optic nerve). The disease is progressive, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen over time.

There is no cure for ARSACS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and medication. Physical therapy can help to improve balance and coordination. Occupational therapy can help to improve fine motor skills and activities of daily living. Speech therapy can help to improve communication. Medication can be used to treat spasticity, pain, and other symptoms.

The prognosis for people with ARSACS varies depending on the severity of the disease. Some people with mild disease may be able to live relatively normal lives, while others with severe disease may require significant assistance with activities of daily living.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive loss of vision due to damage to the optic nerves. It is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, and it is not associated with ataxia or spasticity.
* Friedreich ataxia is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, spasticity, and other neurological problems. It is caused by mutations in the frataxin gene, and it is not associated with retinal nerve fiber layer thickening.
* Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia is a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness in the legs. It is not associated with ataxia or retinal nerve fiber layer thickening.

A superior lumbar hernia is a rare type of hernia that occurs when a loop of intestine or other abdominal contents protrude through a weakness in the abdominal wall in the upper lumbar region. This type of hernia is more common in women and people who have had previous abdominal surgery.

The symptoms of a superior lumbar hernia can vary depending on the size and location of the hernia. Some people may experience no symptoms at all, while others may have pain, abdominal discomfort, and a bulge in the back.

The diagnosis of a superior lumbar hernia is usually made based on a physical examination and imaging tests, such as an abdominal CT scan. Treatment for a superior lumbar hernia may involve surgery to repair the hernia.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A left lateral lumbar lipoma is a benign tumor of fat that can occur in the back. It is not a hernia and would not cause the symptoms described in the case.
* Posterior lateral muscular atrophy with pseudohernia is a condition that causes muscle atrophy in the back. It can cause a bulge in the back, but it would not be associated with pain or other symptoms.
* Postoperative infected seroma is a collection of fluid that can develop after surgery. It is not a hernia and would not cause the symptoms described in the case.

A pathological fracture is a fracture that occurs in a bone that is weakened by a disease process, such as cancer. In this case, the patient has a history of thyroid cancer, which has metastasized to the spine. The metastatic cancer has weakened the bone, making it more susceptible to fracture. The patient's symptoms, including neck and shoulder pain, paresthesia, and pain radiating down his right arm, are consistent with a pathological fracture. The plain radiograph of the neck demonstrated tracheal deviation, which is a sign of spinal instability. The computed tomography of the chest showed a mass in the right lung, which is a common metastasis site for thyroid cancer. The magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine showed a fracture of the T2 vertebra, which is consistent with a pathological fracture.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Metastatic lung cancer is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a pathological fracture. Traumatic vertebral body fracture is unlikely, given the patient's history and lack of recent trauma. Thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms is also unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and the absence of a palpable mass on examination.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. A pathological vertebral body fracture, in this case from metastatic thyroid cancer.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a severe form of posterior uveitis that is caused by herpes zoster virus (VZV). ARN is characterized by the sudden onset of floaters, blurred vision, and pain in the affected eye. The typical fundus findings include vitritis, retinal whitening, and hemorrhages in the peripheral retina.

The mainstay of treatment for ARN is intravenous antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir. In addition, patients may receive oral steroids to reduce inflammation. Aqueous fluid samples can be obtained for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to confirm the diagnosis of ARN. PCR testing is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect VZV DNA in the aqueous humor. Treatment with antiviral agents should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis to prevent permanent vision loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Injecting an antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent is not a standard treatment for ARN. VEGF inhibitors are used to treat retinal diseases that are caused by abnormal blood vessel growth, such as diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration. However, there is no evidence that VEGF inhibitors are effective in treating ARN.
* Ordering a hypercoagulable workup is not necessary in the absence of any signs or symptoms of a hypercoagulable disorder. Hypercoagulable disorders are conditions that increase the risk of blood clots. However, ARN is not caused by a hypercoagulable disorder.
* Obtaining a vitreous sample for culture and injecting vancomycin and ceftazidime is not necessary in the absence of any signs or symptoms of infection. Vitritis is a common finding in ARN, but it is not caused by an infection. In addition, vancomycin and ceftazidime are not effective against VZV.

 42%|████▏     | 646/1525 [2:39:46<3:46:12, 15.44s/it]The correct answer is C. Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy.

The patient has a history of recurrent bilateral periorbital swelling, which has been treated successfully with oral prednisone in the past. The current presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor, which is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition of the orbit. The most common treatment for orbital pseudotumor is oral corticosteroids, which are typically given for a period of 4-6 weeks. In some cases, surgical debulking may be necessary to relieve pressure on the optic nerve. However, this is usually only required in patients who have severe visual loss or who do not respond to corticosteroid treatment.

Oral antibiotic treatment is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of infection. Surgical debulking is not the first-line treatment for orbital pseudotumor, as it is associated with a risk of complications, such as infection and damage to the optic nerve. Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy may be considered in patients who do not respond to corticosteroid treatment, but it is not the first-line treatment.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy. This is the most appropriate treatment for orbital pseudotumor, which is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

The patient has posterior synechiae, which are adhesions between the iris and the lens. These can cause a number of problems, including decreased vision, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and inflammation. The first step in treating posterior synechiae is to break the adhesions. This can be done with a cycloplegic agent, which is a medication that paralyzes the ciliary muscle. This allows the iris to relax and break free from the lens.

Once the adhesions have been broken, the corticosteroid dosage can be tapered. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation, but they can also thin the cornea. This is a risk in patients with posterior synechiae, as the cornea is already thin in these patients. Therefore, the corticosteroid dosage should be tapered slowly and carefully.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Increasing the corticosteroid dosage could worsen the patient's condition by thinning the cornea.
* Performing an AC paracentesis and sending fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis is not indicated in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms of a viral infection, and the posterior synechiae are not caused by a virus.
* Performing an urgent peripheral iridotomy given IOP asymmetry is not indicated in this case. The patient's IOP is only mildly elevated, and there is no evidence of acute angle closure glaucoma.

 42%|████▏     | 648/1525 [2:40:13<3:31:58, 14.50s/it]The correct answer is closure of traumatic cyclodialysis cleft. A cyclodialysis cleft is a separation of the ciliary body from the sclera. It can occur as a result of blunt trauma to the eye, as in this case. The cleft can allow aqueous humor to leak from the anterior chamber, causing a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). This can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss.

The first step in treating a cyclodialysis cleft is to lower the IOP. This can be done with topical or systemic medications, or with a laser iridotomy. If the cleft is small, it may close on its own. However, if the cleft is large or if the IOP remains high, it may need to be closed surgically.

The most common surgical technique for closing a cyclodialysis cleft is to suture the ciliary body to the sclera. This can be done through a small incision in the sclera. In some cases, a scleral buckle may also be placed to help close the cleft.

The prognosis for patients with a cyclodialysis cleft is generally good. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients will recover good vision. However, in some cases, vision loss may be permanent.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with venography would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating a cyclodialysis cleft. Gonioscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to view the angle of the anterior chamber. It would not be helpful in this case because the cleft is located in the posterior chamber. Instilling a miotic agent would cause the pupil to constrict, which would not help to lower the IOP. Performing a peripheral iridotomy would create a new opening in the iris to allow aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber. However, this would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the cleft in the ciliary body.

The patient presented with a flushed face and dilated retinal veins. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of polycythemia vera, a condition in which the body produces too many red blood cells. A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a blood test that measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. A CBC can help to diagnose polycythemia vera and to monitor the condition after treatment.

The other choices are incorrect. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a patient with polycythemia vera. Ocular massage is not a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention for polycythemia vera. Genetic testing for the VHL gene is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a patient with polycythemia vera, unless there is a family history of the condition.

The patient in the case presented has a white dot syndrome, which is a group of retinal disorders characterized by the presence of multiple white dots in the retina. There are many different types of white dot syndromes, and the treatment for each type varies.

In this case, the patient has a history of well-controlled hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis. These medical conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing an autoimmune disorder, which is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Autoimmune disorders can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision problems.

The patient's presentation is consistent with birdshot chorioretinopathy, which is a type of white dot syndrome that is associated with an autoimmune disorder. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is characterized by the presence of multiple, small, white dots in the retina. The dots are caused by inflammation of the choroid, which is the layer of tissue that lies between the retina and the sclera (the white of the eye).

There is no cure for birdshot chorioretinopathy, but there are treatments that can help to control the inflammation and protect the vision. The most common treatment is systemic corticosteroids, which are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs. Other treatments that may be used include immunosuppressive drugs and photodynamic therapy.

In this case, the patient's history and presentation suggest that he may have birdshot chorioretinopathy. The next step in his care should be a hematologic workup to look for evidence of an autoimmune disorder. A hematologic workup includes a blood test to check for the presence of antibodies that attack the body's own tissues. If the hematologic workup is positive, the patient may be started on treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Observation is not the appropriate treatment for birdshot chorioretinopathy. The inflammation in this condition can cause permanent damage to the retina, so it is important to start treatment as soon as possible.
* Initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after HLA-A29 laboratory analysis is not the appropriate treatment for this patient. The patient does not have HLA-A29, which is a genetic marker that is associated with an increased risk of developing birdshot chorioretinopathy.
* Vitreous biopsy is not the appropriate treatment for this patient. A vitreous biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of vitreous fluid is removed from the eye. This procedure is used to diagnose certain eye diseases, but it is not used to treat birdshot chorioretinopathy.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 30% of all lung cancers. It is a highly aggressive cancer that is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The patient in this case is a young man in his early 20s, which is unusual for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Additionally, the patient has no history of smoking, which is another risk factor for this type of cancer.

Carcinoid tumor is a rare type of lung cancer that typically grows slowly and does not metastasize as often as other types of lung cancer. The patient in this case has extensive metastases to the bones and lymph nodes, which is not typical of carcinoid tumor.

Primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor is a rare type of cancer that arises from the germ cells in the mediastinum, which is the area between the lungs. It is most common in young men, and it can spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs. The patient in this case has a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm, which is not typical of primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor.

Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the germ cells in the testes.

The patient is comatose and has a history of deep vein thrombosis. These are both risk factors for stroke. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is the best test to rule out a stroke. A cardiac catheterization is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no history of cardiac disease and the ECG and TTE are normal. A pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTPA) is not necessary, as the patient has no history of pulmonary embolism and the physical examination is normal. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is not necessary, as the TTE is normal and the patient has no history of valvular heart disease.

A CT scan of the head is a non-invasive test that uses X-rays to create images of the brain. It can be used to diagnose stroke, bleeding, tumors, and other abnormalities. A CT scan of the head is the best test to rule out a stroke in a patient who is comatose and has a history of deep vein thrombosis.

A cardiac catheterization is a procedure in which a thin tube is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and threaded up to the heart. The catheter is used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the heart and to inject dye into the arteries to look for blockages. A cardiac catheterization is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no history of cardiac disease and the ECG and TTE are normal.

A pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTPA) is a scan that uses X-rays to create images of the lungs. It can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, a blockage of an artery in the lung. A CTPA is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no history of pulmonary embolism and the physical examination is normal.

A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a test that uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart. It is more sensitive than a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in detecting abnormalities in the heart valves. A TEE is not necessary in this case, as the TTE is normal and the patient has no history of valvular heart disease.

A. Laryngeal tuberculosis is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of tuberculosis, such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and colon adenocarcinoma is not consistent with tuberculosis.

C. Vocal fold granuloma is incorrect because the patient's lesion is not ulcerated, and the patient does not have any history of trauma to the vocal folds. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and colon adenocarcinoma is not consistent with a vocal fold granuloma.

D. Laryngeal amyloidosis is incorrect because the patient's lesion is not white, and the patient does not have any history of amyloidosis. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and colon adenocarcinoma is not consistent with laryngeal amyloidosis.

The patient's history of hyperuricemia, the presence of submucosal white caseous debris in the substance of the lesion, and the patient's lack of symptoms are all consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal gout. Laryngeal gout is a rare condition that occurs when uric acid crystals deposit in the vocal folds. It is most commonly seen in men who are middle-aged or older and who have a history of gout. Laryngeal gout can cause symptoms such as hoarseness, dyspnea, and pain. Treatment typically involves the use of anti-inflammatory medications and colchicine.

 43%|████▎     | 654/1525 [2:41:36<3:32:14, 14.62s/it]The correct answer is C. Kimura disease.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, angioedema, and eosinophilia. It is most commonly seen in young men of Asian descent. The exact cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The most common presenting symptom of Kimura disease is lymphadenopathy, which is usually bilateral and involves the cervical lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are typically non-tender and soft. Other common symptoms include angioedema, which is swelling of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and eosinophilia, which is an increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood.

There is no cure for Kimura disease, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include corticosteroids, antihistamines, and surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal cells that are found in the lymph nodes. The patient in the case does not have any of the classic symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss.
* Tubercular lymphadenitis is a type of infection that affects the lymph nodes. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient in the case does not have any of the classic symptoms of tubercular lymphadenitis, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss.
* Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a rare, benign disorder that affects the lymph nodes. It is characterized by the presence of lymph nodes that are enlarged and have a purplish color. The patient in the case does not have any of the classic symptoms of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.

 43%|████▎     | 655/1525 [2:41:52<3:39:44, 15.16s/it]The correct answer is C. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

Poorly differentiated carcinoma is an incorrect answer because the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with a carcinoma. The patient is a man in his 40s, and carcinomas are more common in older adults. The patient also has Poland syndrome, which is a congenital disorder that affects the development of the muscles and bones on one side of the body. Carcinomas are not typically associated with Poland syndrome.

Ectopic thymoma is an incorrect answer because the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with a thymoma. Thymomas are tumors that arise from the thymus, a gland that is located in the chest. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a thymoma, and there is no evidence of a thymoma on the CT scan.

Peripheral nerve sheath tumor is an incorrect answer because the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with a peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Peripheral nerve sheath tumors are tumors that arise from the cells that surround the nerves. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and there is no evidence of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor on the CT scan.

Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is the correct answer because the patient's history and presentation are consistent with a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. Follicular dendritic cell sarcomas are rare tumors that arise from the dendritic cells, which are cells that are part of the immune system. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, and the CT scan shows a mass that is consistent with a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

In addition to the patient's history and presentation, the immunohistochemical analysis of the removed tissue is also consistent with a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. The tissue was positive for CD21 and CD23, which are markers that are typically expressed by follicular dendritic cells.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

 43%|████▎     | 656/1525 [2:42:09<3:44:45, 15.52s/it]The correct answer is A. Observe only.

The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of bariatric gastric bypass surgery, hysterectomy, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. She has recently undergone ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization. The patient's physical examination showed a tender abdomen without rigidity. Auscultation revealed no abnormal findings. Results of routine blood testing were unremarkable. Imaging studies suggested intussusception at the jejunojejunal anastomosis and a right adnexal mass; the intussusception was successfully reduced laparoscopically. Multiple ruptured follicles were seen on the surface of the right ovary. A preoperative chest computed tomography scan revealed multiple lung nodules of variable sizes, predominantly in the lower lobes.

The most likely explanation for the patient's lung nodules is that they are benign post-surgical changes. The patient has a history of several surgeries, including bariatric gastric bypass surgery, hysterectomy, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. All of these surgeries can cause inflammation and scarring, which can lead to the formation of lung nodules. The patient's lung nodules are also of variable sizes, which is typical of post-surgical changes.

In addition, the patient's physical examination and laboratory findings are not consistent with malignancy. The patient's abdomen is tender, but there is no rigidity, which suggests that the pain is not caused by an abdominal mass. The patient's laboratory findings are unremarkable, which does not suggest that she has an underlying malignancy.

Finally, the patient's chest computed tomography scan shows that the lung nodules are predominantly in the lower lobes. This is a typical location for post-surgical changes.

Based on the above information, the most likely explanation for the patient's lung nodules is that they are benign post-surgical changes. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient and repeat the chest computed tomography scan in 6-12 months. If the nodules remain stable or decrease in size, then no further treatment is necessary. If the nodules increase in size or develop any new features, then further evaluation, such as a biopsy, may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of right-sided endocarditis.
* C. Refer the patient to oncology for chemotherapy is incorrect because the patient's lung nodules are most likely benign.
* D. Start treatment with sirolimus is incorrect because sirolimus is a medication that is used to treat cancer, and the patient does not have cancer.

The patient has a hyperpigmented macule on the medial side of her right palm with hypoesthesia. She has a history of traveling to Bangladesh, where she had a biopsy of the lesion that showed multiple perineural granulomas. The biopsy specimen was negative for Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi. The patient was prescribed 1 dose each of doxycycline, ofloxacin, and rifampin, but she experienced no improvement.

The most likely diagnosis is tuberculous leprosy. Tuberculous leprosy is a chronic, progressive disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and inflammation. The skin lesions are typically hypopigmented or erythematous macules or papules. The nerve damage can cause sensory loss, motor weakness, and autonomic dysfunction. The inflammation can cause lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss.

The treatment for tuberculous leprosy is a combination of dapsone and rifampin. Dapsone is a sulfone drug that is effective against M. leprae. Rifampin is a rifamycin antibiotic that is also effective against M. leprae. The combination of dapsone and rifampin is given for 12 months.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. No further treatment is indicated is incorrect because the patient has a progressive disease that requires treatment.

B. Perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve is incorrect because the diagnosis is already established.

C. Prescribe a 6-month course of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide is incorrect because this is the treatment for tuberculosis, not tuberculous leprosy.

 43%|████▎     | 658/1525 [2:42:34<3:24:09, 14.13s/it]The correct answer is A: The patient has cirrhosis.

The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, which is a liver disease caused by a virus. Hepatitis C can lead to scarring of the liver, a condition called fibrosis. Fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, which is the most severe stage of liver scarring.

The patient's laboratory studies show that he has elevated levels of liver enzymes, which are proteins that are released into the blood when the liver is damaged. This suggests that the patient has significant liver damage.

The patient's VCTE results show that he has a liver stiffness of 17.5 kPa. This is a high value, which suggests that the patient has advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Based on the patient's history, laboratory studies, and VCTE results, it is most likely that the patient has cirrhosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because:

* B: The patient has a healthy liver. is incorrect because the patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C and his laboratory studies show that he has elevated levels of liver enzymes.
* C: The patient has minimal fibrosis. is incorrect because the patient's VCTE results show that he has a liver stiffness of 17.5 kPa, which is a high value.
* D: The patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage. is incorrect because the patient's VCTE results are already suggestive of cirrhosis. A liver biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis in this case.

 43%|████▎     | 659/1525 [2:42:42<2:59:02, 12.40s/it]The correct answer is B. The patient has masked uncontrolled hypertension.

The patient's office BP measurement of 127/74 mm Hg is within the normal range. However, her ambulatory BP monitoring results show that her mean BP levels were 133/86 mm Hg overall, 135/88 mm Hg during the day, and 124/78 mm Hg while sleeping. These results indicate that the patient has masked hypertension, which is defined as high BP readings outside of the doctor's office but normal readings in the doctor's office.

Masked hypertension is a common condition, affecting up to 25% of people with hypertension. It is more common in women, older adults, and people with diabetes or obesity. The exact cause of masked hypertension is unknown, but it may be related to anxiety, stress, or the white coat effect.

The white coat effect is a phenomenon in which people's BP readings are higher when they are in the doctor's office than when they are at home. This is thought to be due to anxiety or stress caused by being in a medical setting.

Masked hypertension is important to diagnose because it can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. If you have any concerns about your BP, talk to your doctor. They may recommend ambulatory BP monitoring to get a more accurate picture of your BP levels.

Here are some additional details about the other answer choices:

* Choice A is incorrect because the patient's ambulatory BP monitoring results show that she has masked hypertension.
* Choice C is incorrect because the patient's ambulatory BP monitoring results show that her BP is elevated both during the day and at night.
* Choice D is incorrect because the patient's ambulatory BP monitoring results show that her BP is elevated both during the day and at night.

LSA is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that most commonly affects the genital area and the inner thighs. However, it can also affect other areas of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.

The characteristic features of LSA include:

* Well-demarcated, atrophic (thin and shiny) patches of skin
* Hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Pain
* Fissures (cracks in the skin)
* Steroid-responsiveness (the lesions tend to improve with treatment with topical steroids)

LSA is more common in women than men, and it is usually diagnosed in people over the age of 50. The cause of LSA is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

There is no cure for LSA, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical steroids, emollients, and oral antihistamines. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove thickened or scarred skin.

Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a rare skin condition that is characterized by atrophic (thin and shiny) skin, hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), and ulcerations (open sores). ACA is most commonly seen in people who have been infected with the Borrelia bacterium, which is the cause of Lyme disease.

Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma (APKP) is a chronic, inherited skin condition that is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. AKPK can be caused by a number of different factors, including genetic mutations, autoimmune disorders, and exposure to certain chemicals.

Sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome) is a rare, genetic disorder that is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin, especially on the hands, feet, and elbows. Sclerotylosis can also affect the internal organs, including the kidneys, heart, and lungs.

The correct answer is A. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus because the patient's presentation is most consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has well-demarcated, atrophic patches of skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. She also has hyperpigmentation and pruritus. These are all characteristic features of LSA.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is characterized by atrophic skin, hyperpigmentation, and ulcerations. Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Sclerotylosis is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin, especially on the hands, feet, and elbows.

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, acquired, follicular hyperkeratosis characterized by the development of multiple, small, follicular papules with keratin spines on the face, neck, and upper trunk. It is most commonly seen in adults with underlying immunosuppression, such as renal transplant recipients. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but can be pruritic. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, with biopsy showing characteristic features of dilated and plugged hair follicles, with enlarged inner root sheath cells and keratin spines. There is no specific treatment for trichodysplasia spinulosa, but the lesions often resolve spontaneously or improve with treatment of the underlying immunosuppression.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lichen spinulosus is a chronic, pruritic dermatosis characterized by small, follicular papules with scale-crusts on the neck, upper trunk, and extremities. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The lesions are typically pruritic. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, with biopsy showing characteristic features of hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. There is no specific treatment for lichen spinulosus, but the lesions often resolve spontaneously or improve with topical corticosteroids.
* Demodecosis is a common, superficial infestation of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands by Demodex mites. It is most commonly seen in adults with seborrheic dermatitis or rosacea. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but can be pruritic or erythematous. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, with skin scrapings showing Demodex mites. Treatment is with topical or oral permethrin or ivermectin.
* Disseminated keratosis pilaris is a common, benign condition characterized by follicular hyperkeratosis on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but can be pruritic. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. There is no specific treatment for disseminated keratosis pilaris, but the lesions often improve with time or with topical emollients.

 43%|████▎     | 662/1525 [2:43:25<3:23:51, 14.17s/it]The correct answer is B. Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans.

Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans (EPSR) is a chronic, recurrent, papulosquamous eruption of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the appearance of annular or semicircular plaques with central clearing and a distinctive, well-demarcated papular border. The lesions are usually located on the trunk and extremities, and they may be pruritic. EPSR is most common in young adults, and it tends to recur seasonally, with lesions typically appearing in the spring and summer.

The diagnosis of EPSR is based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings. The histopathologic findings of EPSR are non-specific, and they may show a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis. There is no specific treatment for EPSR, and the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within several months. However, the lesions may recur, and some patients may experience long-term disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granuloma annulare is a chronic, granulomatous skin disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the appearance of small, red, papules that often form annular or arciform lesions. The lesions are usually located on the hands, feet, and arms, and they may be pruritic. Granuloma annulare is most common in children and young adults, and it tends to resolve spontaneously within several months.
* Deep erythema annulare centrifugum is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the appearance of large, erythematous, annular plaques with central clearing and a well-demarcated, papular border. The lesions are usually located on the trunk and extremities, and they may be pruritic. Deep erythema annulare centrifugum is most common in adults, and it tends to be refractory to treatment.
* Erythema chronicum migrans is a skin lesion that is the first sign of Lyme disease. It is characterized by the appearance of a large, erythematous, annular plaque with central clearing and a well-demarcated, papular border. The lesion is usually located on the trunk or extremities, and it may be pruritic. Erythema chronicum migrans is most common in adults, and it is usually treated with antibiotics.

The patient in the case presented with a number of symptoms that are consistent with cobalt toxicity, including bilateral hearing and vision loss, painful paresthesias in the feet, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the patient's medical history included hip arthroplasty with revisions, which is a known risk factor for cobalt toxicity.

Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease) is an autoimmune disease that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is characterized by optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerves) and transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord). The patient in the case did not have any symptoms of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis, so this diagnosis is unlikely.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the accumulation of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in various tissues and organs. Amyloidosis can affect the heart, kidneys, liver, brain, and other organs. The patient in the case did not have any symptoms of organ dysfunction, so this diagnosis is unlikely.

Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the brain, eyes, and inner ears. It is characterized by hearing loss, vision loss, and encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain). The patient in the case did not have any symptoms of encephalopathy, so this diagnosis is unlikely.

Cobalt toxicity is a condition that can occur when a person is exposed to high levels of cobalt. Cobalt is a metal that is found in a variety of products, including jewelry, batteries, and some medications. Cobalt toxicity can cause a number of symptoms, including hearing loss, vision loss, painful paresthesias, and cardiomyopathy. The patient in the case presented with a number of symptoms that are consistent with cobalt toxicity, so this diagnosis is the most likely.
It is reasoning
 44%|████▎     | 664/1525 [2:43:58<3:37:19, 15.14s/it]The correct diagnosis is colonic ischemia. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes, which are risk factors for colonic ischemia. She presents with sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena. These are classic symptoms of colonic ischemia. On examination, she is hypertensive and has rebound and voluntary guarding, which are signs of peritonitis. Her laboratory results are significant for leukocytosis and an elevated lactate level, which are also consistent with colonic ischemia. The computed tomography scan shows segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum. These findings are highly suggestive of colonic ischemia.

Acute appendicitis is a less likely diagnosis. The patient does not have the classic right lower quadrant pain that radiates to the right shoulder. She also does not have a fever or leukocytosis. The computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of appendicitis, such as an appendicolith or abscess.

Diverticulitis with perforation is also a less likely diagnosis. The patient does not have a history of diverticulosis. She also does not have the classic left lower quadrant pain that radiates to the back. The computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of diverticulitis, such as diverticula or abscesses.

Infectious colitis is also a less likely diagnosis. The patient does not have a fever or leukocytosis. The computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of colitis, such as mucosal thickening or ulcerations.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is colonic ischemia. The patient's history, physical examination, laboratory results, and imaging studies are all consistent with this diagnosis.
It is reasoning
 44%|████▎     | 665/1525 [2:44:14<3:42:18, 15.51s/it]The correct diagnosis is perforation by foreign bodies. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient has a history of endometriosis and adenomyosis, which are both conditions that can lead to the formation of endometriotic implants. These implants can become inflamed and rupture, causing severe abdominal pain.
* The patient's abdominal pain was associated with diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating, which are all symptoms of peritonitis, an inflammation of the lining of the abdomen.
* The patient's CT scan showed multiple abnormal findings, including a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum. These findings are consistent with perforation by foreign bodies.
* The patient's MRI showed 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants. This further supports the diagnosis of perforation by foreign bodies.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Rupture of an infected endometriotic implant is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than perforation by foreign bodies given the patient's history and presentation.
* Inflamed diverticulum is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than perforation by foreign bodies given the patient's history and presentation.
* Malignant growth with unknown primary tumor is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than perforation by foreign bodies given the patient's history and presentation.

 44%|████▎     | 666/1525 [2:44:31<3:48:12, 15.94s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy.

The patient has a firm mass in the right lacrimal gland region that is fixed to the superotemporal orbital rim. The mass is 5 × 4 × 3 cm in size. The overlying skin is intact. There is no evidence of conjunctival inflammatory signs. Ophthalmoscopic examination is unremarkable in both eyes without compression of the optic nerve or disc edema.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and a 10-month history of painless lumps in her neck. She has also been experiencing achiness and decreased visual acuity in her right eye for 2 months. Associated symptoms include dysphagia and fever and chills.

A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of one of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process.

The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic.

The differential diagnosis for a firm mass in the right lacrimal gland region includes:

* Benign tumors:
    * Pleomorphic adenoma
    * Warthin tumor
    * Oncocytoma
    * Lymphangioma
* Malignant tumors:
    * Adenoid cystic carcinoma
    * Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
    * Malignant mixed tumor
    * Squamous cell carcinoma
    * Lymphoma

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy. The first biopsy was inconclusive, and a second biopsy is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis. The results of the second biopsy will guide further management.

If the second biopsy reveals a benign tumor, the patient may be observed or treated with surgery. If the second biopsy reveals a malignant tumor, the patient will need to undergo further treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the next step in the management of this patient.

* Option A: Treat with oral corticosteroids is incorrect because the patient does not have any evidence of inflammation.
* Option B: Treat with methotrexate sodium is incorrect because the patient does not have any evidence of a rheumatologic condition.
* Option C: Perform external beam radiotherapy to the orbit is incorrect because the patient does not have any evidence of a malignancy.

 44%|████▎     | 667/1525 [2:44:43<3:30:51, 14.75s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform orbitotomy with excision. The patient is a 7-month-old boy with a history of an enlarging right periorbital mass. The mass is compressible and transilluminates, consistent with a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are congenital lesions that are lined with epidermis and dermis. They are typically benign but can cause cosmetic deformity and vision problems if they grow large enough. The treatment of choice for dermoid cysts is excision. This can be done through an orbitotomy, which is an incision into the orbit. The cyst is then removed completely, along with any surrounding tissue that may be involved. Radiation therapy is not indicated for dermoid cysts, as it is not effective in treating these lesions. Intralesional corticosteroids may be used to shrink the cyst, but they are not a definitive treatment. They may also cause side effects, such as thinning of the skin. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is to perform an orbitotomy with excision of the dermoid cyst.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

A. Perform aspiration: Aspiration is not a definitive treatment for dermoid cysts. The cyst will likely recur if it is not completely removed.

C. Administer radiotherapy: Radiation therapy is not indicated for dermoid cysts, as it is not effective in treating these lesions.

D. Administer intralesional corticosteroids: Intralesional corticosteroids may be used to shrink the cyst, but they are not a definitive treatment. They may also cause side effects, such as thinning of the skin.

 44%|████▍     | 668/1525 [2:44:55<3:17:40, 13.84s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis.

The patient has a history of handling a bloody raccoon carcass without gloves, which suggests that he may have been exposed to Bartonella henselae or Francisella tularensis. Both of these organisms can cause conjunctivitis, and both can also cause systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy.

Conjunctival cultures are not likely to be helpful in this case, as they are often negative for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis. Repeated computed tomography of orbits with contrast is not necessary, as the patient does not have any signs of orbital cellulitis. Reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limited is also not appropriate, as the patient has systemic symptoms that suggest that his infection may be more serious than a typical case of viral conjunctivitis.

Serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis is the most appropriate next step in this case. This testing can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. If the patient is found to be positive for Bartonella henselae, he may be treated with azithromycin or doxycycline. If the patient is found to be positive for Francisella tularensis, he may be treated with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* **A. Perform conjunctival cultures on blood, chocolate, Löwenstein-Jensen, Sabouraud, and thioglycolate media before restarting antibiotic therapy**

Conjunctival cultures are not likely to be helpful in this case, as they are often negative for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis. In addition, the patient has already received antibiotics, which may make it difficult to culture the organism.

* **B. Repeated computed tomography of orbits with contrast**

Repeated computed tomography of orbits with contrast is not necessary, as the patient does not have any signs of orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis is a serious infection of the eye socket that can cause vision loss and other serious complications. In this case, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a conjunctivitis than with orbital cellulitis.

* **C. Provide reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limited**

Reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limited is also not appropriate, as the patient has systemic symptoms that suggest that his infection may be more serious than a typical case of viral conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis is a common and usually self-limited infection of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white of the eye. It is usually caused by a virus, and most cases resolve within 7 to 10 days without treatment. However, the patient in this case has systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy, which suggest that his infection may be more serious than a typical case of viral conjunctivitis.

* **D. Perform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis**

Serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis is the most appropriate next step in this case. This testing can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. If the patient is found to be positive for Bartonella henselae, he may be treated with azithromycin or doxycycline.

 44%|████▍     | 669/1525 [2:45:10<3:25:02, 14.37s/it]The correct answer is B. Indocyanine green angiography, fluorescein angiography, or both.

Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and fluorescein angiography (FA) are both diagnostic tests used to evaluate the blood vessels of the eye. ICGA is better at visualizing the choroidal vasculature, while FA is better at visualizing the retinal vasculature. In this case, the patient has a submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment, which is a condition that affects the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. ICGA and FA can be used to identify the cause of the hemorrhage and to determine the best course of treatment.

Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of a neurological disorder. B-scan ultrasonography is a useful test for evaluating the vitreous humor and the retina, but it is not as sensitive as ICGA or FA for detecting retinal hemorrhage. Autofluorescence is a non-invasive test that can be used to identify areas of retinal degeneration, but it is not as useful as ICGA or FA for diagnosing macular hemorrhage.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to perform ICGA and FA. These tests will help to determine the cause of the hemorrhage and to guide the choice of treatment.

 44%|████▍     | 670/1525 [2:45:25<3:24:50, 14.37s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain aqueous sample through needle aspirate for viral polymerase chain reaction, and start intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a severe viral infection of the retina that can lead to blindness. The most common cause of ARN is varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox. Other viruses that can cause ARN include herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

The diagnosis of ARN is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The gold standard for diagnosis is a positive viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on a sample of aqueous humor, which is the fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye. A positive PCR test confirms the presence of the virus in the eye.

Treatment for ARN is with intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy. Intravitreal therapy involves injecting antiviral medication directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. Systemic therapy involves taking antiviral medication by mouth.

The goal of treatment is to prevent the virus from spreading to the rest of the retina and to protect the optic nerve. Treatment is usually started as soon as possible after diagnosis.

The prognosis for ARN depends on the severity of the infection. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients recover with good vision. However, some patients may experience permanent vision loss.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the standard of care for ARN.

A. Initiate uveitis workup and start topical corticosteroid therapy is incorrect because uveitis is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, which is the middle layer of the eye. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. The symptoms of uveitis include pain, redness, and blurred vision. Treatment for uveitis depends on the underlying cause. If the uveitis is caused by an infection, then antibiotics or antiviral medications may be prescribed. If the uveitis is caused by an autoimmune disease, then corticosteroid medications may be prescribed.

C. Perform a lumbar puncture is incorrect because a lumbar puncture is not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of ARN. A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. A lumbar puncture may be performed to diagnose a variety of conditions, including meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis.

D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy is incorrect because pars plana vitrectomy is not the standard of care for ARN. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye, is removed. Vitrectomy may be performed to treat a variety of conditions, including retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and macular degeneration.

The patient has a history of ocular hypertension and has undergone pneumatic retinopexy and vitrectomy for retinal detachment. She now has persistent postoperative subretinal fluid and a central scotoma. The examination reveals yellowish subfoveal precipitates, which are consistent with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is a serious complication of retinal detachment that can lead to loss of vision. The treatment for PVR is pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser.

A. Observe the patient is not the correct answer because the patient has persistent postoperative subretinal fluid and a central scotoma. These findings are concerning for PVR, which is a serious complication of retinal detachment. The patient should be treated promptly to prevent further loss of vision.

B. Administer intravitreal corticosteroid injection is not the correct answer because corticosteroids do not treat PVR. In fact, corticosteroids can worsen PVR by suppressing the immune system and allowing the fibrotic tissue to contract.

C. Perform laser photocoagulation is not the correct answer because laser photocoagulation is not effective in treating PVR. In fact, laser photocoagulation can worsen PVR by causing inflammation and scarring.

D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser is the correct answer because pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser is the only treatment that has been shown to be effective in treating PVR. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye. Endolaser is a laser that is used to destroy the fibrotic tissue that is causing the retinal detachment.

Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection that can affect the sinuses, lungs, skin, and other organs. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer, diabetes, or organ transplants.

The symptoms of mucormycosis can vary depending on the organ system involved. In the skin, it can cause a black, necrotic lesion with a central hemorrhagic bulla. This is the lesion that was described in the case.

The diagnosis of mucormycosis is made by biopsy and culture of the lesion. Treatment is with antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Brown recluse envenomation is a spider bite that can cause a necrotic lesion. However, the lesion is typically not black, and it does not have a central hemorrhagic bulla.
* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a skin condition that can cause a necrotic lesion. However, the lesion is typically not black, and it does not have a central hemorrhagic bulla.
* Leukemia cutis is a skin condition that can occur in people with leukemia. However, the lesion is typically not black, and it does not have a central hemorrhagic bulla.

 44%|████▍     | 673/1525 [2:46:05<3:18:58, 14.01s/it]The correct answer is A. Perform fluoroscopy.

Fluoroscopy is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to create real-time moving images of the inside of the body. It is often used to diagnose and treat conditions of the heart and blood vessels, such as valvular heart disease.

In the case of the woman in the question, she has a history of rheumatic heart disease with mechanical mitral and tricuspid valve replacements. These valves are made of artificial materials, and they can become damaged over time. If the valves become damaged, they can leak, which can cause blood to back up into the right atrium and right ventricle. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs.

Fluoroscopy can be used to visualize the valves and determine if they are leaking. If the valves are leaking, fluoroscopy can also be used to guide a doctor in repairing or replacing the valves.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the best way to diagnose or treat valvular heart disease.

Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a type of imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the blood vessels in the lungs. CTPA can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, a blockage of a blood vessel in the lung. However, CTPA is not the best way to diagnose valvular heart disease.

Right heart catheterization is a procedure in which a thin tube is inserted into a vein in the arm or leg and threaded through the heart. Right heart catheterization can be used to measure the pressure in the heart and blood vessels. However, right heart catheterization is not the best way to diagnose valvular heart disease.

Coronary angiography is a procedure in which a thin tube is inserted into an artery in the arm or leg and threaded through the heart. Coronary angiography can be used to visualize the arteries that supply blood to the heart. However, coronary angiography is not the best way to diagnose valvular heart disease.

 44%|████▍     | 674/1525 [2:46:19<3:20:20, 14.13s/it]The correct answer is B. The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.

The PT is a blood test that measures how long it takes blood to clot. A normal PT is 12-13 seconds. The patient's PT is 16 seconds, which is abnormal. This suggests that the patient's blood is not clotting properly, which could increase the risk of bleeding during surgery.

The aPTT is another blood test that measures how long it takes blood to clot. A normal aPTT is 25-35 seconds. The patient's aPTT is 29 seconds, which is normal. This suggests that the patient's blood is clotting properly.

However, the PT is more sensitive to the effects of anticoagulants than the aPTT. This means that the PT is more likely to be abnormal in patients who are taking anticoagulants.

In this case, the patient is taking rivaroxaban, which is a direct oral anticoagulant. Direct oral anticoagulants work by inhibiting the activity of factor Xa. Factor Xa is a protein that is involved in the clotting cascade. By inhibiting factor Xa, direct oral anticoagulants prevent blood from clotting.

The patient's PT is abnormal, which suggests that the rivaroxaban is working and that the patient's blood is not clotting properly. This increases the risk of bleeding during surgery.

The thrombin clotting time and the INR are two other blood tests that can be used to assess a patient's hemostatic status. However, these tests are not as sensitive to the effects of anticoagulants as the PT. Therefore, they are not as useful in assessing the risk of bleeding in patients who are taking anticoagulants.

In conclusion, the patient's hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.

 44%|████▍     | 675/1525 [2:46:30<3:06:01, 13.13s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform further evaluation for subclinical hypercortisolism.

The patient has a 3.1-cm left adrenal mass, which is an indication for further evaluation. The most common cause of adrenal masses is benign adenoma, but malignancy must also be considered. Subclinical hypercortisolism is a state of increased cortisol production that is not severe enough to cause clinical symptoms. It can be caused by adrenal adenomas, Cushing's syndrome, and other conditions.

To evaluate for subclinical hypercortisolism, the patient should have a 24-hour urine collection for free cortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. If the results are abnormal, the patient should have a dexamethasone suppression test. This test involves taking a single dose of dexamethasone at night and measuring the morning cortisol level. A normal response is a decrease in cortisol to less than 5 μg/dL. If the cortisol level is not suppressed, the patient may have subclinical hypercortisolism.

If the patient is found to have subclinical hypercortisolism, the adrenal mass should be further evaluated with imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). If the mass is found to be benign, it may be followed without treatment. If the mass is found to be malignant, it will need to be removed surgically.

A. Advise no further biochemical evaluation is incorrect because the patient has a 3.1-cm left adrenal mass, which is an indication for further evaluation.

B. Obtain 24-hour urine measurement of catecholamines is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of pheochromocytoma, such as headache, palpitations, and sweating.

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of pneumonia, which is a risk factor for CMV infection. She also has leukopenia, which is a common finding in CMV infection. The clinical presentation of CMV ulcers is consistent with the patient's symptoms, and the biopsy specimen shows characteristic CMV inclusions.

Fixed drug eruption is a type of skin reaction that occurs after taking a certain medication. It is characterized by a single, well-defined lesion that appears on the skin after taking the medication. The lesion is usually red, raised, and itchy. Fixed drug eruption is not a sexually transmitted infection, and it is not associated with leukopenia.

Cutaneous candidiasis is a fungal infection of the skin. It is characterized by white, cheesy lesions that appear on the skin. Cutaneous candidiasis is not a sexually transmitted infection, and it is not associated with leukopenia.

Genital herpes simplex virus infection is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by the herpes simplex virus. It is characterized by painful blisters that appear on the genitals. Genital herpes simplex virus infection is not associated with leukopenia.

Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis (NSA) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous glands. It is characterized by the presence of neutrophils in the sebaceous glands and is most commonly seen in young women. The exact cause of NSA is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The most common symptom of NSA is facial erythema, which can be accompanied by papules, pustules, and nodules. The lesions are often symmetrical and located on the cheeks, nose, and forehead. In some cases, the lesions may be associated with scarring and atrophy.

There is no cure for NSA, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, and phototherapy.

Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease that is characterized by the presence of lupus erythematosus (LE) cells in the skin. LE cells are white blood cells that have engulfed the nucleus of another cell. CCLE is most commonly seen in women of childbearing age.

The most common symptom of CCLE is a chronic, scaly rash on the face, scalp, and neck. The rash may be red, brown, or purple and may be accompanied by itching, burning, and tenderness. In some cases, the rash may spread to other parts of the body, such as the hands, feet, and arms.

There is no cure for CCLE, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and phototherapy.

Granuloma faciale is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the presence of small, red papules on the face. The papules are often grouped together and may be associated with scarring. Granuloma faciale is most commonly seen in women of middle age.

The exact cause of granuloma faciale is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no cure for granuloma faciale, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and phototherapy.

Rosacea-like dermatitis is a common, chronic skin condition that is characterized by redness, flushing, and papules on the face. The condition is most commonly seen in women of middle age.

The exact cause of rosacea-like dermatitis is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics, environmental triggers, and immune system dysfunction. There is no cure for rosacea-like dermatitis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, and phototherapy.

Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause annular lesions. However, the lesions of tinea corporis are typically scaly and have a raised border. In addition, tinea corporis is often associated with itching, which the patient in the case report did not experience.

Erythema marginatum is a skin rash that is associated with rheumatic fever. It is characterized by annular lesions with central clearing and a raised border. However, erythema marginatum typically occurs in older children and adults, and it is not associated with any other symptoms.

Erythema migrans is the initial skin lesion of Lyme disease. It is a circular lesion that expands outward with a central clearing. However, erythema migrans is typically associated with fever, fatigue, and headache. In addition, the patient in the case report had no history of exposure to ticks.

Annular erythema of infancy is a benign skin condition that is common in young children. It is characterized by annular lesions with central clearing and a barely elevated border. The lesions of annular erythema of infancy are typically asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. The patient in the case report has all of the classic features of annular erythema of infancy, and the other possible diagnoses are less likely given the history and physical examination.

Outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP) is a first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). ERP involves gradually exposing the patient to their feared stimuli and then helping them to resist the urge to perform their compulsive rituals. This can be a challenging process, but it is often very effective in reducing OCD symptoms.

The patient in this case has severe, intractable OCD that has not responded to treatment with medication. ERP is a well-established treatment for OCD that has been shown to be effective in even the most severe cases. Therefore, referral for outpatient ERP is the most appropriate course of action.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a newer treatment for OCD that has not yet been shown to be as effective as ERP.
* Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that is only used for the most severe cases of OCD that have not responded to other treatments.
* Pharmacotherapy with memantine augmentation of SSRI is a treatment option for OCD that has not been shown to be as effective as ERP.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, the point where a nerve impulse is transmitted to a muscle. This results in muscle weakness, which can be fluctuating and worse with activity. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of myasthenia gravis, such as ptosis (drooping eyelids), diplopia (double vision), or dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Additionally, the patient's brain MRI and CSF analysis were unremarkable, which would not be expected in a patient with myasthenia gravis.

Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder caused by a thiamine deficiency. It is characterized by confusion, ataxia (loss of coordination), and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. Additionally, the patient's thiamine level was normal, which would not be expected in a patient with Wernicke encephalopathy.

Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that is characterized by ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the eye muscles), ataxia, and areflexia (loss of reflexes). The patient in this case does have ophthalmoplegia, but she does not have ataxia or areflexia. Additionally, the patient's brain MRI and CSF analysis were unremarkable, which would not be expected in a patient with Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the brain. It is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), seizures, and movement disorders. The patient in this case does have several of the classic symptoms of anti-Ma2 encephalitis, including encephalitis, seizures, and gait instability. Additionally, the patient's brain MRI revealed T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in the right thalamus, inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus, which are characteristic findings of anti-Ma2 encephalitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is anti-Ma2 encephalitis.

A teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can occur anywhere in the body. It is made up of a variety of tissues, including skin, hair, teeth, and bone. Teratomas are usually benign (noncancerous), but they can sometimes be malignant (cancerous).

A congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a rare lung anomaly that occurs in the developing fetus. It is characterized by abnormal development of the airways and lungs. CPAMs can be classified into three types: type 1, type 2, and type 3. Type 1 CPAMs are the most common type and are usually benign. Type 2 and type 3 CPAMs are less common and are more likely to be malignant.

A carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the organs and tissues of the body. There are many different types of carcinomas, and they can occur in any part of the body.

The patient in the case report had a left-sided pleural effusion and a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary sequestration. Bronchopulmonary sequestration is a congenital anomaly of the lung characterized by an isolated, noncommunicating, nonfunctioning lung segment that receives its blood supply from the systemic circulation. The diagnosis is usually made in infancy or childhood, and the most common presentation is with respiratory distress. Treatment is surgical resection.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical findings. A teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can occur anywhere in the body, and it is not typically associated with a feeding vessel from the descending aorta. A congenital pulmonary airway malformation is a rare lung anomaly that occurs in the developing fetus, and it is not typically associated with a feeding vessel from the descending aorta.

The patient has a history of basal cell carcinoma, which is a type of skin cancer. The lesion on his eyelid has features that are suspicious for skin cancer, including eyelid margin thinning, misdirected eyelashes, central madarosis, meibomian orifice effacement, and overlying telangiectatic vessels. Clinical observation is not an appropriate management strategy for a suspicious lesion, as it does not allow for definitive diagnosis or treatment. A shave biopsy would not provide enough tissue for a definitive diagnosis, and it could also potentially spread the cancer. A wedge biopsy is the most appropriate procedure to obtain a tissue sample for diagnosis and to allow for complete removal of the lesion if it is cancerous.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Clinical observation is not an appropriate management strategy for a suspicious lesion, as it does not allow for definitive diagnosis or treatment.
* B. Shave biopsy would not provide enough tissue for a definitive diagnosis, and it could also potentially spread the cancer.

The patient in this case has bilateral optic nerve edema with disc hemorrhages and peripheral retinal whitening. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of candidal endophthalmitis, which is a fungal infection of the eye. The most common cause of candidal endophthalmitis is Candida albicans, but other species, such as Candida glabrata, can also cause this infection.

Candida endophthalmitis is a serious infection that can lead to blindness if it is not treated promptly. The treatment of candidal endophthalmitis typically involves a combination of intravitreal injections of antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B or foscarnet sodium, and systemic antifungal medications, such as fluconazole or voriconazole.

In this case, the patient has bilateral optic nerve edema and peripheral retinal whitening, which suggests that the infection is already advanced. Therefore, it is important to start treatment as soon as possible. The best way to do this is to perform a diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and an intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium. This will allow the antifungal medication to be delivered directly to the site of the infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Intravitreal injection of amphotericin B is a treatment option for candidal endophthalmitis, but it is not the best option in this case because the patient has bilateral optic nerve edema and peripheral retinal whitening. This suggests that the infection is already advanced, and amphotericin B may not be able to reach the site of the infection effectively.
* Option C: Diagnostic vitrectomy is a procedure that is used to remove infected vitreous from the eye. This procedure may be necessary in some cases of candidal endophthalmitis, but it is not the best option in this case because the patient has bilateral optic nerve edema and peripheral retinal whitening. This suggests that the infection is already advanced, and vitrectomy may not be able to save the patient's vision.
* Option D: Stereotactic radiation therapy to the optic nerve is a treatment option for some types of cancer that affect the optic nerve, but it is not a treatment option for candidal endophthalmitis.

 45%|████▍     | 684/1525 [2:48:29<3:00:25, 12.87s/it]The correct answer is B. Serologic workup.

The patient in the case presented with ptosis and marked proptosis of his left eye for 3 weeks. He denied any signs of diplopia, change in vision, or systemic symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits showed enlargement of the left orbital fat compartments but no evidence of left orbital mass or EOM enlargement.

The differential diagnosis for proptosis includes a variety of conditions, including Graves' disease, thyroid orbitopathy, orbital pseudotumor, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Graves' disease is the most common cause of proptosis in children and adolescents. It is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. Thyroid orbitopathy is a complication of Graves' disease that results in inflammation of the orbital tissues. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-specific inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the orbit. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare, life-threatening infection of the cavernous sinus.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Graves' disease. The CT scan of the orbits shows enlargement of the left orbital fat compartments, which is a characteristic finding of thyroid orbitopathy. The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be a serologic workup to test for thyroid function and thyroid antibodies. If the patient is found to have Graves' disease, he will likely be treated with a combination of medications, including corticosteroids and ophthalmologic steroids.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with and without contrast is not necessary in this case. The CT scan of the orbits has already shown that there is no evidence of a mass lesion or EOM enlargement.
* Chest CT is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms of systemic disease.
* Observation is not appropriate in this case. The patient has a significant proptosis that is likely caused by Graves' disease. He should be treated with medications to control the inflammation and prevent further progression of the disease.

The shallowing of the anterior chamber is a complication of the iridectomy. The purpose of the iridectomy is to create a new opening in the iris to allow aqueous humor to flow out of the anterior chamber. However, if the iridectomy is too large or if the iris is not properly retracted, it can result in shallowing of the anterior chamber.

A sterile air bubble can be injected into the anterior chamber to help deepen the chamber and prevent collapse. The air bubble will also help to tamponade any bleeding that may occur.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Applying fibrin glue to all surgical wounds is not necessary in this case. The iridectomy is a small incision and does not require sutures.
* Option B: Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device. This is a technique that is used to maintain the depth of the anterior chamber during surgery. However, it is not necessary in this case because the shallowing of the anterior chamber is not caused by a lack of aqueous humor.
* Option D: Tilting the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber. This may be helpful in some cases, but it is not necessary in this case because the shallowing of the anterior chamber is obvious on examination.

 45%|████▍     | 686/1525 [2:48:53<2:53:06, 12.38s/it]The correct answer is D: Order an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram.

The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis, both of which are autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of systemic lupus erythematosus, the immune system attacks the connective tissue, which can damage the kidneys, heart, lungs, skin, and joints. In the case of cystic fibrosis, the immune system attacks the cells that produce mucus and sweat, which can lead to blockages in the lungs and digestive system.

The patient is also taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which is a medication used to treat autoimmune diseases. Hydroxychloroquine can cause a number of side effects, including vision problems. In rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can cause a condition called retinal toxicity, which can lead to permanent vision loss.

The patient's symptoms of painless, rapidly declining vision in both eyes are concerning for retinal toxicity. The patient's medical history, medications, and examination findings are consistent with retinal toxicity.

An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. An ERG can help to diagnose retinal toxicity.

A multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) is a more specialized test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to specific patterns of light. The mfERG is more sensitive than the ERG in detecting retinal toxicity.

In this case, the patient should have an ERG and an mfERG to assess for retinal toxicity. If the tests are positive, the patient should stop taking hydroxychloroquine and receive treatment for retinal toxicity.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Option A: Stop the hydroxychloroquine. This is a reasonable option, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient should have an ERG and an mfERG to assess for retinal toxicity before stopping hydroxychloroquine.
* Option B: Perform a lumbar puncture because of suspicion of an infectious process. This is not a reasonable option. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infectious process.
* Option C: Order spinal cord imaging because of suspicion of neuromyelitis optica. This is not a reasonable option. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with neuromyelitis optica.

 45%|████▌     | 687/1525 [2:49:10<3:10:50, 13.66s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform a biopsy of the mass.

The patient is a 54-year-old Cambodian woman who presented for evaluation of a left orbital mass. She was asymptomatic except for 2 years of progressive, painless, left-sided proptosis. Her physical examination findings were unremarkable except for resistance to retropulsion of the left globe and 5 mm of left-sided proptosis by Hertel exophthalmometry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a superonasal orbital mass that was T1 isointense to brain parenchyma and heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, with a small cystic component and avid peripheral contrast enhancement. Bony remodeling without destruction was noted, as well as displacement of the superior oblique and superior rectus muscles. The interpreting radiologist thought that the mass did not have the typical appearance of a vascular malformation or of a schwannoma and that other neoplastic and chronic infectious causes, including a parasitic origin, should be considered.

The differential diagnosis for a superonasal orbital mass includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors, as well as inflammatory and infectious processes. The most common benign tumors include lymphangioma, hemangioma, and dermoid cyst. The most common malignant tumors include lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and meningioma. Infectious processes that can involve the orbit include orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, and fungal infection.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a biopsy of the mass. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment. The biopsy can be performed either by open surgery or by needle biopsy. Open surgery is the preferred method if the mass is large or if there is concern for malignancy. Needle biopsy is a less invasive option, but it is not as accurate as open surgery.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Observe and perform another MRI in 6 months. This is not an appropriate option because the mass is causing proptosis and could potentially lead to visual loss.
* Option B: Empirically treat with an antiparasitic agent. This is not an appropriate option because the diagnosis is not certain and empirical treatment could lead to complications.
* Option D: Perform whole-body positron emission tomography. This is not an appropriate option because it is not necessary to diagnose the mass and it would not provide any additional information that would be helpful in the management of the patient.

 45%|████▌     | 688/1525 [2:49:21<3:00:54, 12.97s/it]The correct answer is B. Tenosynovial giant cell tumor.

Ganglion cyst of the ankle joint is an incorrect answer because the patient's mass was not a fluid-filled cyst. The MRI scan showed a soft tissue mass with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion. This is consistent with a tenosynovial giant cell tumor, which is a benign tumor of the soft tissues.

Ewing sarcoma (soft-tissue metastasis) is an incorrect answer because the patient's mass was not a metastasis from an Ewing sarcoma. The patient had a history of a Ewing sarcoma in the right thigh, but the FDG-PET scan showed high uptake in the right thigh and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint. This suggests that the patient had two primary tumors, not a metastasis from the Ewing sarcoma in the right thigh.

Synovial sarcoma is an incorrect answer because the patient's mass was not a synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in adults. The patient in this case was an adolescent girl, and the MRI scan showed a soft tissue mass with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion. This is consistent with a tenosynovial giant cell tumor, which is a benign tumor of the soft tissues.

 45%|████▌     | 689/1525 [2:49:38<3:16:08, 14.08s/it]The correct answer is B. Administer unfractioned heparin and bridge to warfarin.

The patient in this case has a history of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 12 months earlier for symptomatic aortic stenosis. He is now presenting with subacute progressive dyspnea on exertion. A TTE result shows an interval development of bioprosthetic aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 29 mm Hg. His left ventricular systolic function is normal. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4-D CT) angiography showed nodular filling defects along all of the leaflets with restricted excursion.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is bioprosthetic valve thrombosis. Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is a rare but serious complication of TAVR. It is estimated to occur in 1-2% of patients within the first year after TAVR. The risk of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is higher in patients with a history of aortic stenosis, a low ejection fraction, and a history of bleeding.

The treatment for bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is anticoagulation with unfractioned heparin and warfarin. Unfractioned heparin is a blood thinner that is used to prevent further clot formation. Warfarin is a blood thinner that is used to maintain anticoagulation. Warfarin can take several days to reach its full effect, so unfractioned heparin is used initially to bridge the gap.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, Obtain blood culture samples and administer combination cefazolin, rifampin, and gentamicin, is incorrect because there is no evidence of infection in this case.
* Option C, Increase the aspirin dosage to 325 mg daily, discontinue clopidogrel, and administer ticagrelor, is incorrect because aspirin and clopidogrel are already being used in this case. Ticagrelor is a blood thinner that is used to prevent blood clots in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It is not indicated for the treatment of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis.
* Option D, Pursue urgent valve replacement, is incorrect because the patient's left ventricular systolic function is normal. Urgent valve replacement is only indicated in patients with severe aortic stenosis and a low ejection fraction.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Administer unfractioned heparin and bridge to warfarin.

 45%|████▌     | 690/1525 [2:49:53<3:19:16, 14.32s/it]The correct answer is C. Collagenous fibroma.

Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, aggressive fibromatosis that typically occurs in the extremities. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells in a dense collagenous matrix. Neurofibromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nerves that are caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene. They are characterized by the proliferation of Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and insulate nerve fibers. Solitary fibrous tumors are rare, benign tumors that can occur in any part of the body. They are characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells in a loose, myxoid stroma.

The patient in the case presented with a slow-growing, non-painful mass in the parapharyngeal space. The mass was well-circumscribed and had abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The scattered tumor cells were spindled to stellate shaped and had the morphology of myofibroblasts. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of collagenous fibroma.

Desmoid-type fibromatosis is typically a more aggressive tumor than collagenous fibroma. It is also more likely to recur after surgery. Neurofibromas are typically benign tumors, but they can be associated with the development of other tumors, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Solitary fibrous tumors are typically benign tumors, but they can be locally aggressive and can recur after surgery.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Collagenous fibroma. The patient in the case presented with a slow-growing, non-painful mass in the parapharyngeal space. The mass was well-circumscribed and had abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The scattered tumor cells were spindled to stellate shaped and had the morphology of myofibroblasts. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of collagenous fibroma.

 45%|████▌     | 691/1525 [2:50:09<3:27:47, 14.95s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication.

The patient has had 10 years of retrosternal burning and suspected gastroesophageal reflux. Despite taking omeprazole (20 mg once daily) 30 minutes before breakfast, avoiding foods that precipitated symptoms, and sleeping with his head elevated, heartburn and regurgitation while supine continued. He reported intermittent solid-food dysphagia for 2 years but no weight loss (254-lb [115 kg] body weight); physical examination results were unremarkable. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed normal esophageal mucosa and normal biopsies. Given his persisting symptoms, an esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) study was performed (Table 1; eFigure in the Supplement).

The HRM study showed a 10-cm long aperistaltic segment in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This suggests that the patient has achalasia, a condition in which the LES does not relax properly, preventing food from passing from the esophagus to the stomach.

The treatment for achalasia is a Heller myotomy, which is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the muscle fibers of the LES to allow food to pass through more easily. A partial fundoplication is often performed at the same time to prevent reflux.

A 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication is a more extensive surgery that involves wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the lower esophagus. This is not the best option for this patient because he does not have reflux.

Increasing omeprazole dosing to twice daily would not be effective in treating achalasia. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces stomach acid production. However, in achalasia, the problem is not too much stomach acid, but rather a failure of the LES to relax.

Replacing omeprazole with nortriptyline would not be effective in treating achalasia either. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, it is not effective in treating achalasia.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Perform esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication.

 45%|████▌     | 692/1525 [2:50:24<3:26:00, 14.84s/it]The correct answer is B. Pyoderma gangrenosum.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non-infectious skin disease that causes painful, rapidly spreading ulcers. It is often associated with underlying autoimmune conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The clinical presentation of pyoderma gangrenosum is variable, but the most common presentation is a painful, erythematous nodule that rapidly progresses to an ulcer. The ulcers are often undermined and have a characteristic "crater-like" appearance. They may be located anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found on the lower extremities.

The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows a characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis.

There is no cure for pyoderma gangrenosum, but treatment is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing the ulcers from spreading. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral antibiotics, and systemic immunosuppressive agents.

The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical presentation of pyoderma gangrenosum.

* Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive, necrotizing infection of the perineum and genitalia. It is most commonly seen in men with diabetes or other underlying medical conditions.
* Severe irritant contact dermatitis (chemical burn) is a skin reaction caused by exposure to a chemical irritant. It is characterized by erythema, edema, and vesiculation.

 45%|████▌     | 693/1525 [2:50:41<3:32:54, 15.35s/it]The correct answer is A. Borderline-borderline leprosy.

The patient is a woman in her 50s with a 2-year history of disseminated dermatosis involving the trunk and limbs. The dermatosis was characterized by polymorphic erythematous macules and plaques with elevated and indurated borders without evanescence to pressure. She was referred from another clinic with the presumptive diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. Previous treatment included antihistamines and oral corticosteroids for several months without improvement. Dysesthesia was recorded on her lesions. Results from complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses were normal, as was a thyroid profile. A punch biopsy specimen from a trunk plaque was obtained, and histopathological analysis was performed.

The histopathological analysis revealed a chronic dermic granulomatous process, as well as a chronic dermic nonencapsulated granulomatous infiltrate with a perineural distribution formed by mature epitheloid cells and encapsulated by lymphocytes.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is borderline-borderline leprosy. Borderline-borderline leprosy is a form of leprosy that is characterized by a mixture of tuberculoid and lepromatous features. It is the most common form of leprosy in the world.

The clinical presentation of borderline-borderline leprosy is variable. The most common skin lesions are erythematous macules and plaques that are often asymmetrical and distributed over the trunk and limbs. The lesions may be hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, and they may be associated with sensory loss, motor weakness, and autonomic dysfunction.

The diagnosis of borderline-borderline leprosy is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and response to treatment. The treatment of borderline-borderline leprosy is with a combination of dapsone and rifampin. The treatment course is usually 12 months.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It is characterized by a chronic, progressive skin rash that may eventually spread to other organs. The histopathological findings in mycosis fungoides are different from those in borderline-borderline leprosy.

Disseminated annular granuloma is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by the formation of multiple, annular, erythematous granulomas. The histopathological findings in disseminated annular granuloma are different from those in borderline-borderline leprosy.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in various organs. The skin is one of the most common organs involved in sarcoidosis. The histopathological findings in sarcoidosis are different from those in borderline-borderline leprosy.

Epidermal nevus is a congenital anomaly of the epidermis that presents as a single or multiple patches of skin with abnormal pigmentation and/or texture. It is not associated with linear keratotic lesions.

Linear porokeratosis is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by linear streaks of hyperkeratotic papules on the extremities. It is not associated with Blaschkoid distribution.

Linear Darier disease is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by linear streaks of erythematous, scaly papules on the extremities. It is not associated with Blaschkoid distribution.

Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by linear streaks of hyperkeratotic papules on the extremities. It is associated with Blaschkoid distribution.

The patient in the case presented with linear hyperkeratotic papules on her right arm that were present since birth and did not appear to change on sun exposure or with seasons. She had no family history of similar cutaneous features. Physical examination revealed that these lesions were distributed in a Blaschkoid pattern. On close inspection, numerous reddish punctate keratotic papules were observed on the patient’s right forearm that coalesced into plaques on the dorsum of her right hand. No extracutaneous abnormalities were found. A skin biopsy specimen from the patient’s right arm was obtained.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus. This is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by linear streaks of hyperkeratotic papules on the extremities. It is associated with Blaschkoid distribution. The lesions are thought to be caused by a defect in the development of the eccrine ducts. The treatment is usually conservative and includes topical keratolytics and emollients. In some cases, laser therapy or surgery may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of the patient in the case.

 46%|████▌     | 695/1525 [2:51:11<3:30:15, 15.20s/it]The correct answer is B. Cavernous sinus syndrome.

Cavernous sinus syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterized by the involvement of the cavernous sinus, a venous sinus located in the skull base. The cavernous sinus is a paired structure that lies on either side of the sella turcica and contains the internal carotid artery, the abducens, oculomotor, trochlear, and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve, and the sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion.

The most common cause of cavernous sinus syndrome is infection, which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Other causes include trauma, neoplasms, and inflammatory conditions.

The clinical manifestations of cavernous sinus syndrome vary depending on the structures involved. The most common symptoms are headache, periorbital swelling, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and Horner's syndrome. Other symptoms may include facial pain, double vision, and vision loss.

The diagnosis of cavernous sinus syndrome is based on the clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. In cases of infection, antibiotics are used. In cases of trauma, surgery may be necessary to remove the source of infection or to repair the damage. In cases of neoplasms, surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may be used.

The prognosis for cavernous sinus syndrome depends on the underlying cause. In cases of infection, the prognosis is generally good with prompt treatment. In cases of trauma, the prognosis depends on the extent of the injury. In cases of neoplasms, the prognosis depends on the stage of the cancer.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Thyroid eye disease is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the muscles and tissues around the eyes. The most common symptoms are proptosis, eyelid retraction, and diplopia. Thyroid eye disease is not a cause of cavernous sinus syndrome.

C. Orbital apex syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterized by the involvement of the orbital apex, a region in the skull base that contains the optic nerve, the oculomotor nerve, the trochlear nerve, the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the superior orbital fissure. The most common cause of orbital apex syndrome is tumors, but it can also be caused by infection, trauma, and inflammatory conditions.

D. Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the orbit. The most common cause of orbital cellulitis is bacteria, but it can also be caused by viruses or fungi. The most common symptoms of orbital cellulitis are fever, pain, and swelling around the eye. Orbital cellulitis is not a cause of cavernous sinus syndrome.

A cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation is a stroke that occurs when a blood clot forms in the heart and travels to the brain, blocking a blood vessel and causing brain damage. The patient in this case did not have any symptoms of atrial fibrillation, and there was no evidence of a blood clot in the heart on the echocardiogram. Additionally, the patient's symptoms were not consistent with a cardioembolic stroke. A patent foramen ovale is a small opening between the upper chambers of the heart that is present in some people at birth. It usually closes on its own within a few months of birth, but it can remain open in some people. If a patent foramen ovale is present, it can allow blood to flow from the right side of the heart to the left side of the heart. This can occur if there is a pressure difference between the two sides of the heart. If a blood clot forms in the right side of the heart, it can travel through the patent foramen ovale to the left side of the heart and then to the brain, where it can block a blood vessel and cause a stroke. However, the patient in this case did not have any symptoms of a patent foramen ovale, and there was no evidence of a blood clot in the heart on the echocardiogram. Additionally, the patient's symptoms were not consistent with a stroke caused by a patent foramen ovale. Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves. It can occur when bacteria enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. The bacteria can then attach to the valves and cause an infection. Bacterial endocarditis can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The patient in this case did have fever and chills, but the other symptoms were not consistent with bacterial endocarditis. Additionally, there was no evidence of bacterial endocarditis on the echocardiogram.

The most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is an atrioesophageal fistula. An atrioesophageal fistula is an abnormal connection between the heart and the esophagus. It can occur as a result of surgery, trauma, or infection. An atrioesophageal fistula can allow blood to flow from the heart to the esophagus. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including coughing up blood, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain. The patient in this case had all of these symptoms. Additionally, the echocardiogram showed evidence of an atrioesophageal fistula.

 46%|████▌     | 697/1525 [2:51:41<3:28:54, 15.14s/it]The correct answer is D. Scrotal cystocele.

A hydrocele is a collection of fluid around the testicle. It is the most common cause of scrotal swelling. Hydroceles are usually painless and harmless. However, if they are large, they can cause discomfort or pain. Hydroceles can be caused by a number of things, including injury to the scrotum, infection, or a problem with the testicles. Treatment for a hydrocele usually involves surgery to drain the fluid.

Intermittent testicular torsion is a condition in which the testicle twists on its cord, cutting off the blood supply. This can cause severe pain, swelling, and nausea. Testicular torsion is a medical emergency and requires surgery to untwist the testicle and restore blood flow.

Primary testicular lymphoma is a cancer that starts in the testicles. It is a rare cancer, but it is the most common type of cancer in the testicles. Testicular lymphoma can cause swelling in the scrotum, as well as pain, tenderness, and a lump on the testicle. Treatment for testicular lymphoma usually involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

A scrotal cystocele is a protrusion of the bladder into the scrotum. It is a rare condition that is usually caused by a weakness in the muscles and fascia that support the bladder. Scrotal cystoceles can cause pain, swelling, and discomfort. Treatment for a scrotal cystocele usually involves surgery to repair the weakness in the muscles and fascia.

In this case, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of intermittent scrotal swelling. The swelling is not reducible, the right testicle is not palpable, and the transillumination test is nondiagnostic. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of scrotal cystocele. The other options are less likely because they do not explain the patient's history and physical examination findings.

 46%|████▌     | 698/1525 [2:51:58<3:33:19, 15.48s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform cerebral angiography.

The patient has a history of migraine headaches and has recently developed bilateral visual field loss. On examination, she has a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes.

The most likely cause of the patient's visual field loss is a stroke. Cerebral angiography is the most definitive test to diagnose a stroke. It can also be used to identify the cause of the stroke, such as an occlusion of a cerebral artery.

Treatment of a stroke depends on the cause of the stroke. If the stroke is caused by an occlusion of a cerebral artery, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) may be used to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the brain. However, tPA cannot be used if the stroke has occurred more than 4.5 hours before treatment is started.

In the patient's case, cerebral angiography is the most appropriate next step. The results of the angiography will help to determine the cause of the stroke and the best course of treatment.

A. Begin treatment with calcium channel blockers for migraine prevention is incorrect because the patient has already been diagnosed with a stroke. Calcium channel blockers are used to prevent migraines, but they are not effective in treating strokes.

B. Perform cerebral angiography is the correct answer because it is the most definitive test to diagnose a stroke. It can also be used to identify the cause of the stroke, such as an occlusion of a cerebral artery.

C. Begin treatment with tissue plasminogen activator is incorrect because tPA cannot be used if the stroke has occurred more than 4.5 hours before treatment is started. In the patient's case, the stroke has been present for more than 4.5 hours, so tPA would not be an option.

D. Observation is incorrect because the patient has a stroke. Treatment of a stroke is essential to prevent further damage to the brain.

 46%|████▌     | 699/1525 [2:52:14<3:36:11, 15.70s/it]The correct answer is B. Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl who presented with blurry vision. She had no other symptoms and was otherwise healthy with no medical history of any disease or surgeries. She was not taking any medications. Her family history was also unremarkable.

The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, results of pupillary examination were normal without relative afferent pupillary defect, and results of the rest of the anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Posterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a slightly elevated, white, multicystic lesion approximately 3 disc diameters that was located inferior to the optic nerve (Figure 1). Results of examination of the left eye were unremarkable. The patient’s blurred vision was resolved with new eyeglasses.

The differential diagnosis for a white lesion in the retina includes:

* Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
* Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC)
* Drusen
* Epiretinal membrane
* Macular hole
* Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS)
* Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
* Optic disc pit
* Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV)
* Retinal detachment
* Retinitis pigmentosa
* Sarcoidosis
* Toxoplasmosis

In this case, the patient is a young girl with no history of any eye disease. She has a new, white, multicystic lesion in the retina. The lesion is located inferior to the optic nerve, which is a common location for optic disc pits. Optic disc pits are congenital anomalies that are associated with a number of retinal diseases, including myopic CNV, retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to perform an MRI of the brain. This will help to rule out any underlying brain lesions that could be causing the patient's retinal findings. If the MRI is normal, then the patient should be followed up with a retinal specialist to monitor the lesion.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) is not indicated in this case because the patient has no symptoms of retinal vascular disease.
* C. Follow up in 12 months to reexamine the lesion is not the best management option because the lesion could be progressing.
* D. Request fundus examination of the family members is not indicated in this case because the patient has no family history of eye disease.

The patient presented with sudden-onset visual loss of the right eye for 1 day. She had recently traveled to Ireland, where she rode a horse. She denied previous upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. She had no other abnormal neurologic signs or symptoms.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of ocular larva migrans (OLM), which is a parasitic infection caused by nematodes. OLM is most commonly caused by Toxocara canis, which is a roundworm that infects dogs and cats. Humans can become infected by OLM by coming into contact with contaminated soil or sand, or by eating food that has been contaminated with dog or cat feces.

The initial ophthalmologic workup was unremarkable, but at a subsequent visit, 2 small glistening lesions in the retina were identified. These lesions are characteristic of OLM. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an attenuated ellipsoid zone at a position nasal to the fovea. This finding is also consistent with OLM.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination. This procedure allows the physician to visualize the retina in great detail and to look for the presence of nematodes. If nematodes are found, the patient can be treated with antiparasitic medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A. Ordering indocyanine green angiography is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis of OLM is already suspected. B. Referring the patient to the neurology department is not necessary, as the patient does not have any neurologic symptoms. C. Beginning treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is not necessary, as OLM is a self-limited infection.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare, inherited optic neuropathy that affects men more often than women. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down from mother to child. The disease typically presents in young adults with sudden, painless loss of vision in one or both eyes. Vision loss is usually severe and permanent.

There is no cure for LHON, but there are treatments that can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve vision. Treatment may include medication, eyeglasses, and low-vision aids.

The patient in the case report presents with a number of features that are consistent with LHON. She is a middle-aged woman with sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye. She has a family history of vision loss, which is a risk factor for LHON. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was normal, which rules out other possible causes of vision loss, such as multiple sclerosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform genetic testing for LHON. If the patient is found to have a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA, she can be offered treatment to slow the progression of the disease.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Checking methylmalonic acid level and repleting vitamin B12 if elevated would be appropriate if the patient had vitamin B12 deficiency, but this is not a likely diagnosis in this case. Repeating the MRI scan would not be helpful, as the initial MRI scan was normal. Recommending a lumbar puncture is not appropriate, as this is not a diagnostic test for LHON.

The patient has bilateral optic disc edema with a circumferential halo, which is a characteristic finding of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare but serious condition that is characterized by hypertension, headache, seizures, and altered mental status. It is usually caused by a rapid increase in blood pressure, but it can also be caused by other conditions, such as infection, autoimmune disease, and drug use.

Doxycycline is a medication that is used to treat a variety of infections, including malaria. However, doxycycline has also been reported to cause PRES. In a study of patients with PRES, 10% of the patients had been taking doxycycline.

The patient in this case has no evidence of infection, and his elevated intracranial pressure is most likely due to PRES. Therefore, the best treatment is to discontinue doxycycline and treat the hypertension.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

The patient has a complex medical history with multiple congenital anomalies, including coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis, cerebellar hemorrhage, hydrocephalus treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, scoliosis due to hemivertebrae, congenital diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia, and hearing loss. These findings are consistent with a genetic syndrome.

OCT angiography, topical ocular hypotensive therapy, and strabismus surgery are all appropriate treatments for specific conditions, but they are not indicated in this patient. OCT angiography is a diagnostic test that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. Topical ocular hypotensive therapy is used to lower intraocular pressure. Strabismus surgery is used to correct misalignment of the eyes.

Genetic testing is the only option that will provide information about the patient's underlying genetic condition. This information can be used to develop a management plan for the patient and to provide genetic counseling to the patient's family.

BPDCN is a rare, aggressive, non-Hodgkin lymphoma of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. It is characterized by the presence of large, atypical cells with a plasmacytoid appearance in the skin and other organs.

The patient in the case report has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a group of blood disorders characterized by the presence of abnormal blood cells in the bone marrow. MDS can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of cancer that affects the myeloid cells in the bone marrow.

The patient in the case report developed multiple dark brown cutaneous papules measuring at 3.0 to 5.0 cm. These papules are consistent with the clinical presentation of BPDCN. The patient also had a positive CD56 immunohistochemical stain, which is a marker that is typically positive in BPDCN cells.

The patient's bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular marrow maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with no increase of blasts or other abnormal populations. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of BPDCN, as BPDCN is a neoplasm of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are not normally found in the bone marrow.

The patient's cytogenetic results were abnormal, showing del(20)(q11.2q13.3)[8]/46,XY[12]. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of BPDCN, as del(20)(q11.2q13.3) is a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in BPDCN.

In conclusion, the patient in the case report has a diagnosis of cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a rare, aggressive, non-Hodgkin lymphoma of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. It is characterized by the presence of large, atypical cells with a plasmacytoid appearance in the skin and other organs. The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and pathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of BPDCN.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Leukemia cutis is a type of leukemia that involves the skin. However, the patient in the case report does not have any evidence of leukemia in the bone marrow.
* Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that affects the skin. However, the patient in the case report does not have any evidence of lymphoma in the skin.
* Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, the patient in the case report does not have any evidence of T-cell lymphoma.

The patient is a 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The initial electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury, and the troponin I concentration has risen significantly. These findings suggest that the patient has had an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

The goals of treatment for ACS are to relieve symptoms, prevent further myocardial damage, and reduce the risk of death. In this patient, the symptoms have resolved and the troponin I concentration has stabilized. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is to defer intervention and continue supportive management. This includes medications to control pain, blood pressure, and heart rate, as well as aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further blood clot formation. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of recurrent ischemia or heart failure.

Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they would all involve invasive procedures that are not necessary at this time. PCI with drug-eluting stents or bioresorbable vascular scaffolds is a treatment option for patients with ACS who have persistent or recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy. However, this patient has already had an MI and her symptoms have resolved. Therefore, she does not need further intervention at this time. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgical procedure that is used to bypass blocked coronary arteries. It is an option for patients with ACS who have severe or multiple blockages in the coronary arteries that cannot be treated with PCI. However, this patient does not have any evidence of severe or multiple blockages. Therefore, CABG is not necessary at this time.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Defer intervention and continue supportive management.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder of the immune system that causes the accumulation of Langerhans cells in the skin, bone, and other organs. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in children. The lymphadenopathy in Langerhans cell histiocytosis is usually non-tender and mobile.

Reactive sinus histiocytosis is a condition that occurs when the sinuses become inflamed and filled with histiocytes. It is usually caused by an infection, such as a cold or the flu. The lymphadenopathy in reactive sinus histiocytosis is usually non-tender and mobile.

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder of the immune system that causes the accumulation of histiocytes in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in children. The lymphadenopathy in Rosai-Dorfman disease is usually bilateral and non-tender. It is also characteristic of Rosai-Dorfman disease that the histiocytes show emperipolesis, which is the infiltration of other cells by histiocytes.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy that has been unresponsive to antibiotics. The lymphadenopathy is bilateral and non-tender, and the patient has no other symptoms. The physical examination and laboratory findings are consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease. The lymph node biopsy shows increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells, and the histiocytes show emperipolesis. These findings are characteristic of Rosai-Dorfman disease.

It is characterized by a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and can have a variety of histologic appearances. The most common clinical presentation is a slow-growing, painless mass. Treatment is surgical excision with clear margins.

Mucoceles are retention cysts of salivary glands that are caused by obstruction of a duct. They are most common in the lower lip, and present as a smooth, fluctuant mass. Treatment is incision and drainage.

Lipomas are benign tumors of fat cells that are most common in the subcutaneous tissue of the trunk and extremities. They are typically soft, compressible, and painless. Treatment is excision if the tumor is large or symptomatic.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor that can occur in any of the major salivary glands. It is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in children. The most common clinical presentation is a slow-growing, painless mass. Treatment is surgical excision with clear margins, followed by radiation therapy.

The patient in the case presented with a slow-growing, painless mass in the upper lip. The mass was whitish, firm, and nodular. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or histopathologic findings. Mucoceles are typically smooth, fluctuant masses that occur in the lower lip. Lipomas are soft, compressible, and painless masses that occur in the subcutaneous tissue. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are malignant tumors that can occur in any of the major salivary glands.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory skin disease that can affect any part of the body, but most commonly the face, scalp, ears, and hands. It is characterized by well-defined, round or oval, red, scaly patches of skin. The lesions may be tender, and they may also be associated with hair loss, scarring, and eye problems.

The cause of DLE is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease, meaning that the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. DLE is more common in women than men, and it is usually diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 50.

There is no cure for DLE, but it can be treated with a variety of medications, including topical steroids, oral steroids, and light therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove scarring or to correct eye problems.

 46%|████▋     | 709/1525 [2:54:40<3:23:39, 14.97s/it]The correct diagnosis is cutaneous sarcoidosis. This is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, but most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

The clinical features of cutaneous sarcoidosis vary depending on the site of involvement. In the skin, sarcoidosis can present as a variety of lesions, including papules, plaques, nodules, and ulcers. The lesions are often erythematous and indurated, and they may be associated with telangiectasias.

The diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis is made on clinical grounds, supported by histopathological examination of a skin biopsy. The histopathological features of cutaneous sarcoidosis are non-caseating granulomas in the dermis.

There is no specific treatment for cutaneous sarcoidosis, but a variety of therapies may be used to control the symptoms and prevent complications. These therapies include topical steroids, systemic steroids, and immunosuppressive drugs.

The prognosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis is generally good. Most patients experience spontaneous remission of their lesions within a few years. However, a small number of patients may develop chronic or recurrent disease.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a rare type of skin cancer that typically presents as a single, slowly growing plaque. The lesions of granulomatous mycosis fungoides are not indurated and they are not associated with telangiectasias.
* Pretibial myxedema is a condition characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin of the lower legs. The lesions of pretibial myxedema are typically smooth, soft, and non-erythematous.

The patient's history of exposure to silica dust, as well as the appearance of the lesions, are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous silica granuloma. Silica granuloma is a chronic inflammatory condition that occurs in response to the deposition of silica dust in the skin. The lesions are typically firm, erythematous, and nontender, and they may be papular, nodular, or plaque-like.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect any organ in the body, including the skin. However, the lesions of sarcoidosis are typically non-tender, and they are often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss.

Infectious granulomas can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The lesions of infectious granulomas are typically tender, and they may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and lymphadenopathy.

Keloids are raised, irregularly shaped scars that can develop after injury or surgery. They are typically firm and non-tender, and they may be associated with itching and pain.

In conclusion, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous silica granuloma. The other choices are less likely based on the information provided.

The patient in this case has a known history of a large cyst on the right kidney. He sustained blunt trauma in a skiing crash, and CT showed a right-sided grade IV renal injury involving his known renal cyst with active arterial extravasation. The patient underwent selective angioembolization of the renal laceration. In the 24 hours after embolization, the patient required 2 U of red blood cells via transfusion for anemia. On examination, the patient reported moderate pain in the abdomen and right side and demonstrated a distended abdomen in the absence of any peritoneal signs. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to assess for a source of continued bleeding.

The CT scan shows a large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma and grade IV renal laceration displacing the patient’s abdominal viscera to the left. There is also a contrast-filled structure medial to the liver. This structure is the gallbladder, which is normally not seen on CT scans because it does not contain any contrast material. However, in this case, the gallbladder is seen because it is filled with contrast material that has leaked from the renal laceration. This is a sign of active bleeding from the renal injury.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the findings on the CT scan. Hepatic artery injury would not cause a contrast-filled structure to be seen medial to the liver. Jejunal injury with intraluminal contrast extravasation would cause contrast material to be seen within the lumen of the jejunum, not outside of the bowel wall. Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm would cause a collection of blood to be seen in the peripancreatic region, not a contrast-filled structure medial to the liver.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Contrast-enhancing gallbladder. The findings on the CT scan are consistent with active bleeding from the renal laceration.

 47%|████▋     | 712/1525 [2:55:29<3:36:25, 15.97s/it]The correct answer is C. Do plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis.

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and the presence of retinal venous dilatation, hemorrhages, hard exudates, and serous macular detachment are all consistent with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, the patient's blood analysis revealed a low hemoglobin level, an increased serum creatinine level, and a normal fasting blood glucose level. These findings are not consistent with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and suggest that the patient may have a paraproteinemia.

A paraproteinemia is a condition in which the body produces an abnormal protein called a paraprotein. Paraproteins can be produced by a number of different diseases, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and light chain amyloidosis.

The most common symptom of a paraproteinemia is fatigue. Other symptoms may include weakness, weight loss, bone pain, and numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.

If a paraproteinemia is suspected, the doctor will order blood tests to measure the level of the paraprotein in the blood. The doctor may also order a bone marrow biopsy to look for evidence of a plasma cell myeloma.

Treatment for a paraproteinemia depends on the type of disease that is causing the paraprotein. Treatment for multiple myeloma may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation. Treatment for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Treatment for light chain amyloidosis may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

In the case of the patient described above, the doctor should order plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis to determine if the patient has a paraproteinemia. If the patient does have a paraproteinemia, the doctor will then need to determine the type of disease that is causing the paraprotein and recommend appropriate treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Intravitreal dexamethasone implant, grid photocoagulation, and oral corticosteroids are all treatments for nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, these treatments would not be effective in treating a paraproteinemia.

Cidofovir is a nephrotoxic drug that can cause acute kidney injury. The patient in the case has a history of chronic kidney disease and has already developed acute kidney injury as a result of cidofovir therapy. Continuing cidofovir therapy would further worsen the patient's kidney function and could lead to end-stage renal disease.

Cycloplegia is the paralysis of the ciliary muscle, which allows the lens of the eye to focus on objects at different distances. This is important in the case of choroidal effusions, which can cause the lens to become displaced and blurred vision. Topical corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the eye.

Restarting cidofovir therapy would be the wrong choice because it would further worsen the patient's kidney function. Administering bilateral subtenon corticosteroid injections would be the wrong choice because it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's choroidal effusions, which is cidofovir therapy. Beginning treatment with oral prednisone would be the wrong choice because it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's choroidal effusions, which is cidofovir therapy.

The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. She is currently 15 weeks into pregnancy. She presents with subacute bilateral vision loss that is worse in the left eye.

The first step in the management of this patient is to assess her vital signs. This includes measuring her heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. This will help to determine if she is in any acute distress.

The next step is to determine her blood glucose level. This is important because diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes. If her blood glucose level is not well-controlled, it can lead to worsening of her retinopathy.

Once her vital signs and blood glucose level have been assessed, the next step is to perform a complete eye examination. This will include a dilated fundus examination to assess the extent of her retinopathy.

If the patient has proliferative diabetic retinopathy, she may need to be treated with laser photocoagulation. This is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This can help to prevent further vision loss.

The patient may also need to be treated with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. These medications help to reduce the growth of new blood vessels in the retina.

The patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels will need to be closely monitored. She may also need to be started on antihypertensive and/or antidiabetic medications.

The patient will need to be followed closely by an ophthalmologist. She will need to have regular eye exams to monitor her condition and to make sure that she is receiving the appropriate treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Obtain a fluorescein angiogram is not the first step in the management of this patient. A fluorescein angiogram is a test that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is typically used to diagnose and assess the severity of diabetic retinopathy. However, it is not necessary to obtain a fluorescein angiogram in the emergency department setting.
* B. Determine blood glucose level and perform glycated hemoglobin test is important, but it is not the first step in the management of this patient. The patient's vital signs and blood glucose level should be assessed first.
* D. Perform immediate computed tomography of the head is not necessary in this patient. The patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a neurological problem. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is typically only performed if there is a suspicion of a neurological problem.

The patient is a 14-year-old girl with progressive vision loss in both eyes. She has optic nerve atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and bilateral central scotomas. Imaging of the brain and orbits shows thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity is noted within the bilateral optic nerves.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes optic neuritis, optic nerve sheath meningioma, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. It is typically caused by demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Optic neuritis can cause sudden, severe vision loss in one or both eyes. The vision loss is usually reversible with treatment.

Optic nerve sheath meningioma is a tumor that grows on the optic nerve sheath. It is the most common type of optic nerve tumor. Optic nerve sheath meningioma can cause progressive vision loss, headache, and double vision.

IIH is a condition in which the pressure inside the skull is increased. It is most common in women of childbearing age. IIH can cause headache, vision problems, and nausea and vomiting.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is optic nerve sheath meningioma. The patient is a young girl with progressive vision loss, optic nerve atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and bilateral central scotomas. Imaging of the brain and orbits shows thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity is noted within the bilateral optic nerves. These findings are consistent with optic nerve sheath meningioma.

The treatment for optic nerve sheath meningioma is typically surgery. However, surgery is not always possible or appropriate. In some cases, radiotherapy (fractionated external beam radiotherapy) may be used to treat optic nerve sheath meningioma. Radiotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Radiotherapy can be used to shrink the tumor and improve vision.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Observation is not an appropriate treatment for optic nerve sheath meningioma. Optic nerve sheath meningioma is a progressive disease that can cause significant vision loss. Observation would not prevent further vision loss.

Optic nerve sheath biopsy is a surgical procedure to remove a piece of tissue from the optic nerve sheath. Optic nerve sheath biopsy is not a curative treatment for optic nerve sheath meningioma. It is used to diagnose the condition and to determine the best course of treatment.

Optic nerve sheath biopsy and radiotherapy is not an appropriate treatment for this patient. Radiotherapy is a more effective treatment for optic nerve sheath meningioma than optic nerve sheath biopsy.

Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the hair follicles that can cause hair loss. It is characterized by small, flat-topped, scaly lesions on the scalp. The lesions are often itchy and may be painful. LPP is most common in middle-aged and older adults.

Trichepitheliomas are benign tumors of the hair follicle. They are small, skin-colored papules that are often found on the face and scalp. Trichoepitheliomas are usually not harmful, but they can be cosmetically disfiguring.

Miliary osteoma cutis is a rare condition characterized by the development of small, hard, skin-colored papules on the face. The papules are caused by the deposition of calcium salts in the skin. Miliary osteoma cutis is usually not harmful, but it can be cosmetically disfiguring.

Angiofibromas are benign tumors of the blood vessels. They are small, red papules that are often found on the face. Angiofibromas are most common in people with tuberous sclerosis.

In this case, the patient has a history of LPP. She also has numerous, grouped, skin-colored papules on the face. The papules are not inflammatory and are not associated with hair loss. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of miliary osteoma cutis.

Lichen planopilaris is a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have hair loss. Trichoepitheliomas are also less likely because the papules are not skin-colored and are not associated with hair loss. Angiofibromas are the least likely diagnosis because the patient does not have a history of tuberous sclerosis.

It is characterized by painful, inflamed nodules and abscesses in the groin, armpits, and under the breasts. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical features of hidradenitis suppurativa, such as nodules or abscesses.

C. Pemphigus vegetans is a rare autoimmune blistering disease that typically affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by large, wart-like lesions that are often painful and difficult to treat. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical features of pemphigus vegetans, such as the large, wart-like lesions.

D. Linear hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection is a rare, chronic skin condition that is caused by the herpes simplex virus. It is characterized by linear, raised, red lesions that often resemble scars. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical features of linear hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection, such as the linear, raised, red lesions.

The patient in the case has a history of Crohn disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn disease can cause inflammation and ulceration of the digestive tract, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the skin. The patient in the case has linear, moist, eroded, exophytic, condyloma-like plaques of the bilateral submammary folds, intergluteal cleft, and under the abdominal apron. These lesions are consistent with metastatic Crohn disease.

Metastatic Crohn disease is a rare complication of Crohn disease that occurs when the disease spreads to other parts of the body, such as the skin. The most common sites of metastasis are the skin, lungs, and liver. The symptoms of metastatic Crohn disease vary depending on the site of metastasis. Skin lesions are the most common symptom, and they can range from small, red spots to large, ulcerated plaques. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The treatment of metastatic Crohn disease depends on the site of metastasis and the severity of the symptoms. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for metastatic Crohn disease is variable, and it depends on the site of metastasis, the severity of the symptoms, and the response to treatment.

The patient in the case presented with a 3-year history of nonhealing crusted scalp lesions. He had previously been treated with various topical glucocorticosteroids and antibiotics without improvement. The physical examination revealed multiple disseminated erythematous papules, petechial hemorrhages, and yellowish crusts on the scalp. The remaining skin and mucosal surfaces, as well as neck, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, were unremarkable. The patient did not show any other obvious abnormalities, but his mother reported occasional otitis media. The family history was negative for skin disease. Routine blood examinations revealed no pathological findings. A whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed 2 osteolytic lesions on the right frontoparietal skull. A punch biopsy specimen of an erythematous papule on the scalp was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological analysis. In addition, immunohistochemical stainings were performed.

The histopathological findings showed a subepidermal infiltrate consisting of large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, solitary lymphocytes, and eosinophilic granulocytes. The infiltrate stained positively for CD1A.

The clinical and histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multisystem LCH. LCH is a rare, non-cancerous disorder of the immune system that affects cells called Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells are found in the skin, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other organs. LCH can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in children under the age of 10. The symptoms of LCH vary depending on the organs that are affected. The most common symptoms are skin lesions, bone pain, and fever. LCH can also affect the liver, spleen, lungs, and eyes.

The treatment for LCH depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In more severe cases, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. The prognosis for LCH is generally good. Most children with LCH make a full recovery. However, some children may have long-term problems, such as growth problems or hearing loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition that causes flaking, redness, and itching of the scalp. Crusted scabies is a contagious skin infection caused by mites. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. None of these conditions would explain the patient's osteolytic lesions on the skull.

 47%|████▋     | 719/1525 [2:57:11<3:24:47, 15.24s/it]The correct answer is D. Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury.

The patient has a complex medical history with multiple developmental delays and behavioral problems. He has a microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16, which is associated with a number of medical and behavioral problems. The patient's tantrums, aggression, and self-injurious behavior are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The first step in management is to provide a safe and supportive environment for the patient. This includes providing structure and routine, as well as teaching the patient coping skills. It is also important to identify and address any triggers for the patient's behavior.

In addition to behavioral interventions, medication may also be helpful in managing the patient's symptoms. Aripiprazole is a medication that is approved for the treatment of irritability, agitation, and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorder. It is a dopamine antagonist that works by reducing the activity of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in movement, motivation, and reward. Aripiprazole can help to improve the patient's behavior by reducing impulsivity, aggression, and self-injury.

It is important to note that aripiprazole is not without side effects. The most common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, and weight gain. Other possible side effects include dizziness, headache, and anxiety. It is important to monitor the patient for any side effects and to adjust the medication as needed.

In addition to behavioral interventions and medication, it is also important to provide support to the patient's family. The family may need help in understanding the patient's diagnosis and in managing his behavior. They may also need help in accessing resources and support services.

Overall, the best approach to managing the patient's symptoms is to use a combination of behavioral interventions and medication. This will help to ensure that the patient receives the most effective treatment for his condition.

The other choices are not appropriate for the patient's situation.

A. Referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier status is not necessary at this time. The patient's diagnosis is already known, and there is no evidence that his family members are at risk for the condition.

B. Pharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion is not a well-established treatment for the patient's condition. There is limited evidence that R-baclofen is effective in treating children with autism spectrum disorder.

C. Pharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behavior is not an appropriate treatment for the patient's irritability, agitation, and self-injury. Citalopram is an antidepressant that is not typically used to treat these symptoms.

 47%|████▋     | 720/1525 [2:57:25<3:19:46, 14.89s/it]The correct answer is C. Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP). PRP is a chronic, papulosquamous skin disorder characterized by well-demarcated, scaly patches on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of PRP is made clinically, and laboratory tests are typically not necessary. Treatment is with topical or systemic corticosteroids, and the disease usually resolves within several months to a year.

Tinea pedis, also known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection of the skin of the feet. The most common symptoms are itching, burning, and scaling of the skin between the toes. Tinea pedis can be treated with topical antifungal medications.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells. This can lead to thick, red, scaly patches on the skin. Psoriasis can be treated with a variety of medications, including topical corticosteroids, light therapy, and oral medications.

Juvenile plantar dermatosis is a common skin condition that affects children. It is characterized by dry, cracked skin on the soles of the feet. Juvenile plantar dermatosis is usually not serious and can be treated with over-the-counter moisturizers and emollients.

In the case of the adolescent girl with desquamation of both feet, the most likely diagnosis is PRP. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with PRP, and the fungal smear skin test with potassium hydroxide preparation was negative. Tinea pedis, psoriasis, and juvenile plantar dermatosis are less likely diagnoses in this case.

 47%|████▋     | 721/1525 [2:57:41<3:25:27, 15.33s/it]The correct diagnosis is testicular cancer. The patient is a young man with a history of abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss. He has a palpable mass in the left paraumbilical region. The patient has a normal right testis but a missing left testis. This suggests that the patient may have had an undescended testis, which is a risk factor for testicular cancer. The computed tomography scan shows large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses. The intraperitoneal mass is heterogenous, with linear calcifications. This is a characteristic finding of testicular cancer. The retroperitoneal mass is homogeneous, with associated lymphadenopathy. This is also a common finding in testicular cancer. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels are further supportive of a diagnosis of testicular cancer. Colorectal cancer is less likely in a young man, and there is no evidence of metastasis to the liver or lungs. Bladder cancer is also less likely in a young man, and there is no evidence of hematuria or urinary symptoms. Lymphoma is less likely in a young man with a normal white blood cell count. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the incorrect choices:

* Colorectal cancer is less likely in a young man, and there is no evidence of metastasis to the liver or lungs. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men, but it is most common in people over the age of 50. The patient in this case is only in his 30s, so colorectal cancer is less likely. Additionally, there is no evidence of metastasis to the liver or lungs, which are common sites of metastasis for colorectal cancer.
* Bladder cancer is also less likely in a young man, and there is no evidence of hematuria or urinary symptoms. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is most common in people over the age of 50. The patient in this case is only in his 30s, so bladder cancer is less likely. Additionally, there is no evidence of hematuria or urinary symptoms, which are common symptoms of bladder cancer.
* Lymphoma is less likely in a young man with a normal white blood cell count. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. It is the sixth most common cancer in men, but it is most common in people over the age of 60. The patient in this case is only in his 30s, so lymphoma is less likely. Additionally, the patient's white blood cell count is normal, which is not a typical finding in lymphoma.

 47%|████▋     | 722/1525 [2:57:58<3:29:28, 15.65s/it]The correct answer is C: Rectosigmoid junction rupture.

The patient has a history of abdominal trauma caused by a bicycle handlebar. He presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and paraumbilical ecchymosis. Physical examination reveals general abdominal tenderness and distension. Laboratory test findings show an elevated leukocyte count, but normal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. An abdominal CT scan reveals a pneumoperitoneum and free fluid in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.

These findings are consistent with a rectosigmoid junction rupture. A rectosigmoid junction rupture is a tear in the lower part of the colon. It is a serious injury that can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and death. The most common cause of a rectosigmoid junction rupture is blunt abdominal trauma, such as that caused by a bicycle handlebar.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A pancreas injury would not cause paraumbilical ecchymosis or free fluid in the abdomen. Flaring ulcerative colitis would not cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A duodenal injury would not cause pneumoperitoneum.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Rectosigmoid junction rupture.
It is reasoning
 47%|████▋     | 723/1525 [2:58:05<2:56:20, 13.19s/it]The correct answer is A. Surgery.

The patient has a foreign body in the vitreous of the left eye. This is a serious condition that can lead to retinal detachment, infection, and blindness. The only way to remove the foreign body is with surgery.

Observation is not an option because the foreign body is a threat to the patient's vision. Laboratory workup for uveitis is not necessary because the patient has already been diagnosed with uveitis. Topical and systemic corticosteroid treatment can help to control the inflammation associated with uveitis, but it will not remove the foreign body.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Observation: Observation is not an option because the foreign body is a threat to the patient's vision. The foreign body could cause retinal detachment, infection, and blindness.
* Laboratory workup for uveitis: Laboratory workup for uveitis is not necessary because the patient has already been diagnosed with uveitis. The patient's symptoms and the findings on examination are consistent with uveitis.
* Topical and systemic corticosteroid treatment: Topical and systemic corticosteroid treatment can help to control the inflammation associated with uveitis, but it will not remove the foreign body. The only way to remove the foreign body is with surgery.

 47%|████▋     | 724/1525 [2:58:20<3:03:07, 13.72s/it]The correct answer is C. Refer the patient to the nephrologist for evaluation of kidney function.

The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, which are risk factors for diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure. The patient also has a kidney transplant, which increases his risk of developing diabetic nephropathy.

The patient's presentation with sudden-onset, painless vision loss in the right eye is consistent with a retinal pigment epithelium tear. Retinal pigment epithelium tears can be caused by a number of conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and trauma. In the case of diabetic retinopathy, retinal pigment epithelium tears are more likely to occur in patients with poor kidney function.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's retinal pigment epithelium tear and to assess his risk of developing further vision loss, it is important to evaluate his kidney function. The nephrologist will perform a physical examination, order blood tests, and may also order imaging studies such as an ultrasound or CT scan of the kidneys.

If the patient's kidney function is found to be impaired, the nephrologist will recommend treatment to slow the progression of the kidney disease. Treatment may include medications, lifestyle changes, or dialysis.

In the meantime, the patient should continue to take his medications as prescribed by his doctor and monitor his blood sugar levels closely. He should also avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

The patient should also see an ophthalmologist for follow-up care. The ophthalmologist will monitor the patient's retinal pigment epithelium tear and may recommend additional treatment, such as laser therapy or surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss.

* Option A: Monitor the patient. This is not the best option because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. The patient needs to be evaluated by a nephrologist to determine the cause of his kidney disease and to receive treatment to slow the progression of the disease.
* Option B: Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. This is not the best option because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, but it is not a treatment for kidney disease.
* Option D: Provide photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. This is not the best option because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is a treatment for age-related macular degeneration, but it is not a treatment for kidney disease.
It is reasoning
 48%|████▊     | 725/1525 [2:58:31<2:50:40, 12.80s/it]The correct answer is B. Order urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The patient has presented with a number of concerning symptoms, including bilateral progressive painless blurring of vision for 1 week, associated with metamorphopsia, acute binocular horizontal diplopia, and disorientation. These symptoms are consistent with a number of possible conditions, including optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. While it is not possible to definitively diagnose the patient's condition without further testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation. MRI is a highly sensitive imaging modality that can detect a wide range of abnormalities, including those that may be causing the patient's symptoms. In addition, MRI is a safe and non-invasive procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform a lumbar puncture is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any symptoms that are suggestive of meningitis, such as fever, headache, or nuchal rigidity. Lumbar puncture is a procedure that involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Lumbar puncture is typically performed to diagnose meningitis, a bacterial infection of the CSF. However, in this case, the patient does not have any symptoms that are suggestive of meningitis, so lumbar puncture is not necessary.
* C. Repeat sputum culture and sensitivity testing is not the correct answer because the patient's sputum culture and sensitivity testing were negative. This means that the patient does not have a bacterial infection of the lungs. Sputum culture and sensitivity testing are procedures that are used to identify the bacteria that are causing a lung infection and to determine which antibiotics are effective against those bacteria. However, in this case, the patient's sputum culture and sensitivity testing were negative, so repeating these tests is not necessary.
* D. Start broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is not the correct answer because the patient does not have a bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria. Intravenous antibiotics are antibiotics that are given through a vein. However, in this case, the patient does not have a bacterial infection, so starting broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is not necessary.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Order urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. MRI is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of the patient's condition.

 48%|████▊     | 726/1525 [2:58:47<3:05:15, 13.91s/it]The correct answer is B. Review medical history and systemic medications.

The patient has progressive bilateral scleral pigmentation, which is a rare finding. There are a number of possible causes, including:

* Ocular hypertension: This is a condition in which the pressure inside the eye is higher than normal. It can lead to glaucoma, a serious condition that can damage the optic nerve and lead to blindness.
* Medications: Some medications, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause scleral pigmentation.
* Systemic diseases: A number of systemic diseases, such as Addison's disease and hemochromatosis, can also cause scleral pigmentation.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's scleral pigmentation, it is important to review her medical history and current medications. It is also important to perform a physical examination, including an ophthalmologic examination.

If the patient has a history of ocular hypertension, it is important to monitor her intraocular pressure closely. If her intraocular pressure is uncontrolled, she may need to undergo laser peripheral iridotomy or other treatment.

If the patient is taking any medications that can cause scleral pigmentation, it is important to discuss these medications with her and consider whether they can be discontinued or changed.

If the patient has a systemic disease, it is important to treat the underlying condition.

In some cases, the cause of scleral pigmentation cannot be determined. In these cases, it is important to monitor the patient closely and to treat any associated symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect because:

* A. Order a B-scan: A B-scan is a type of ultrasound that can be used to evaluate the eye. However, it is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a serious eye condition.
* C. Discontinue antiglaucomatous medications: This would be a premature step, as the patient's intraocular pressure is well-controlled.
* D. Obtain a 24-hour urine sample: This would not be helpful in this case, as there is no evidence that the patient has a systemic disease.

 48%|████▊     | 727/1525 [2:59:01<3:05:43, 13.96s/it]The correct answer is B: Perform corneal biopsy.

The patient has a central corneal ulcer that has failed to respond to topical antibiotics. The presence of a hypopyon suggests that the infection is severe and may be sight-threatening. A corneal biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose the cause of the infection and to determine the best course of treatment.

A second anterior chamber paracentesis and culture would not be helpful, as the cultures from the previous paracentesis were negative. Intravitreal antibiotics would be appropriate if the infection had spread to the vitreous, but there is no evidence of this on the B-scan ultrasonography. Prednisolone eyedrops would be contraindicated in this case, as they could suppress the immune system and allow the infection to worsen.

Therefore, the correct next step is to perform a corneal biopsy. This will allow the surgeon to obtain a sample of tissue from the ulcer to be sent for culture and microscopic examination. The results of the biopsy will help the surgeon to determine the best course of treatment, which may include more aggressive antibiotics, antivirals, or surgery.
It is reasoning
 48%|████▊     | 728/1525 [2:59:18<3:14:38, 14.65s/it]The correct answer is B. Superficial corneal biopsy.

The patient has bilateral corneal deposits 1 week after starting prednisone therapy. The most likely diagnosis is steroid-induced crystalline keratopathy. This is a rare but well-recognized complication of topical or systemic corticosteroid use. The deposits are composed of cholesterol and calcium salts, and they typically occur in the subepithelial and anterior stromal layers of the cornea.

The treatment of steroid-induced crystalline keratopathy is discontinuation of the corticosteroid therapy and, in some cases, superficial corneal biopsy. Topical steroids are not effective in treating this condition, and they may actually worsen the deposits. Topical fortified vancomycin is not indicated, as this is a non-infectious condition. Penetrating keratoplasty is rarely needed, but may be considered if the deposits are severe and cause significant visual impairment.

In this case, the patient should be advised to discontinue the prednisone therapy and have a superficial corneal biopsy. The biopsy will help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the deposits. The patient should also be advised to avoid contact lens wear and to use artificial tears to keep the eyes moist.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. Initiate topical prednisolone therapy: This is not the correct treatment for steroid-induced crystalline keratopathy. Topical steroids may actually worsen the condition.
* C. Begin topical fortified vancomycin therapy: This is not indicated, as this is a non-infectious condition.
* D. Penetrating keratoplasty: This is rarely needed, but may be considered if the deposits are severe and cause significant visual impairment.

 48%|████▊     | 729/1525 [2:59:28<2:57:08, 13.35s/it]The correct answer is B. Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA).

PEA is a rare type of lung cancer that is thought to arise from the cells that line the airways. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance on a microscope, which is often described as "glandular" or "intestinal-like." PEA is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged and older adults, and it is more common in men than in women.

The symptoms of PEA can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people with PEA may not have any symptoms at all, while others may experience symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of PEA is made based on a biopsy of the lung tumor. The biopsy will be examined by a pathologist, who will look for the characteristic features of PEA.

The treatment for PEA depends on the stage of the cancer. Early-stage PEA may be treated with surgery, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Advanced-stage PEA is usually treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

The prognosis for PEA varies depending on the stage of the cancer. Early-stage PEA has a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of up to 70%. Advanced-stage PEA has a poorer prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Metastatic colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the colon or rectum and spreads to the lungs. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of colorectal cancer, and the biopsy of the lung tumor did not show any evidence of colorectal cancer.
* Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs but the primary tumor cannot be found. The patient in this case has a biopsy of the lung tumor that shows the characteristic features of PEA. Therefore, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary is not correct.
* Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymph nodes. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of lymphoma, and the biopsy of the lung tumor did not show any evidence of lymphoma. Therefore, the diagnosis of lymphoma is not correct.

 48%|████▊     | 730/1525 [2:59:44<3:09:39, 14.31s/it]The correct answer is C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is a type of arrhythmia that can cause palpitations. The electrocardiogram shows marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6. This is a classic finding in right ventricular hypertrophy, which can be a complication of atrial flutter. Obtaining an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads will help to confirm the diagnosis of right ventricular hypertrophy and assess the severity of the condition.

A high-sensitivity troponin I level is not necessary in this patient because she does not have any symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia. A D-dimer level is not necessary in this patient because she does not have any risk factors for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. A ventilation/perfusion lung scan is not necessary in this patient because she does not have any symptoms or signs of pulmonary embolism.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of right ventricular hypertrophy and assess the severity of the condition.

 48%|████▊     | 731/1525 [2:59:57<3:00:54, 13.67s/it]The correct diagnosis is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARM). This is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of primitive small round cells that have a characteristic histologic appearance. ARM is often aggressive and can metastasize to distant sites, such as the lungs, bones, and brain. Treatment typically consists of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the olfactory epithelium in the nose. It is more common in adults than children and has a different histologic appearance than ARM.
* Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterized by the presence of primitive small round cells that have a characteristic immunohistochemical profile. Ewing sarcoma is not associated with the same risk factors as ARM and has a different clinical course.
* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not associated with the same risk factors as ARM and has a different clinical course.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of primitive small round cells that have a characteristic histologic appearance.

 48%|████▊     | 732/1525 [3:00:13<3:11:19, 14.48s/it]The correct answer is C. Amyloidosis.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. This can lead to organ failure and death. There are many different types of amyloidosis, but the most common type is AL amyloidosis, which is caused by the build-up of a protein called light chain amyloid.

The symptoms of amyloidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Common symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, weakness, and swelling of the hands, feet, and abdomen. In some cases, amyloidosis can also cause heart problems, kidney problems, or nerve problems.

There is no cure for amyloidosis, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment may include medications, blood transfusions, or a bone marrow transplant.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 60s with a history of COPD and dyspnea. He presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, splenomegaly, ascites, and a retroperitoneal mass posterior to the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration from the retroperitoneal mass and ascitic fluid reveals no malignant cells. The patient subsequently develops a left-sided lateral chest wall hematoma, and, in retrospect, it was thought that the retroperitoneal mass was actually a hematoma because multiple follow-up studies demonstrated the mass steadily decreasing in size. Echocardiography shows right atrial and ventricular dilatation and increased thickness of the interventricular septum. Laboratory tests show elevated results for serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria levels and altered liver function tests but a normal coagulation profile. Routine surveillance noncontrast CT imaging of the neck demonstrates a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing few punctate calcifications centered in the epiglottis with clinically significant narrowing of the oropharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal airways by the enlarged epiglottis.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with AL amyloidosis. The presence of a retroperitoneal mass that was initially thought to be malignant but was later found to be a hematoma is a classic presentation of AL amyloidosis. The patient also has elevated levels of serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria, which are laboratory findings that are commonly seen in patients with AL amyloidosis. The CT imaging of the neck shows a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing few punctate calcifications centered in the epiglottis, which is a characteristic finding of AL amyloidosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the epiglottis. However, it is not a common cause of oropharyngeal and supraglottic airway narrowing. In addition, the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.
* Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes. However, it is not a common cause of oropharyngeal and supraglottic airway narrowing. In addition, the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with lymphoma.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that can affect the muscles. However, it is not a common cause of oropharyngeal and supraglottic airway narrowing. In addition, the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Amyloidosis.

 48%|████▊     | 733/1525 [3:00:29<3:18:30, 15.04s/it]The correct answer is C. Sigmoid sinus diverticulum.

A sigmoid sinus diverticulum is a sac-like outpouching of the sigmoid sinus, a vein that drains blood from the brain. It is a relatively common finding, occurring in up to 10% of the population. Most sigmoid sinus diverticula are asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, and headache.

The patient in this case presents with several features that are consistent with a sigmoid sinus diverticulum. She has a history of pulsatile tinnitus, which is a whooshing sound that is synchronous with the heartbeat. She also reports that compression of her right neck decreases the loudness of the tinnitus, which is a sign that the tinnitus is caused by blood flow in the sigmoid sinus. In addition, the CT scan shows a sac-like outpouching of the sigmoid sinus on the right side.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A carotid cochlear dehiscence is a defect in the bone that separates the internal carotid artery from the cochlea, the hearing organ in the inner ear. This can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. A semicircular canal dehiscence is a defect in the bone that separates the semicircular canals from the middle ear. This can cause vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. An aberrant internal carotid artery is an abnormal condition in which the internal carotid artery runs through the middle ear. This can cause pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. However, the CT scan does not show any evidence of an aberrant internal carotid artery.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is C. Sigmoid sinus diverticulum.

Perineural spread is a rare but well-described phenomenon in which cancer cells spread along the nerves. It is most commonly seen with head and neck cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma.

In this case, the patient has a history of right ear skin cancer that was excised by a dermatologist. The MRI shows an elongated enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the right SCM muscle. This is consistent with perineural spread of the patient's original cancer.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Primary nerve sheath tumor is a rare tumor that arises from the cells that make up the nerves. It is not a common cause of a neck mass.

B. Thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein is an inflammation of the vein that can cause a neck mass. However, the patient's MRI does not show any evidence of inflammation or thrombosis of the vein.

C. Traumatic neuroma is a benign tumor that can form at the site of a nerve injury. It is not a common cause of a neck mass.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The other answer choices are incorrect.

The patient has a 5-year history of a slightly pruritic and painful rash of the right lateral area of the neck and right axilla. It was worse during the summers, and blisters sometimes developed. Emollients were unhelpful. The patient was otherwise healthy. His sister had diabetes mellitus and a similar rash in her axillae. The patient performed indoor manual labor as a maintenance engineer and had no significant sun exposure. Physical examination revealed irregularly thickened skin of the right axilla and right lateral area of the neck containing hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, multiple acrochordons (skin tags), malodorous crust, and areas of maceration and erosion. Further examination of the skin revealed pseudofolliculitis barbae in the submental and mandibular regions bilaterally. The nails, oral cavity, and mucosal membranes appeared normal. A biopsy of right axillary skin was performed.

The biopsy showed epidermal acantholysis causing separation of keratinocytes into a dilapidated brick wall appearance. This is a characteristic finding of hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the apocrine glands. Hidradenitis suppurativa is characterized by recurrent episodes of painful, tender, and fluctuant nodules and abscesses in the apocrine gland-bearing areas, such as the axillae, groin, and inframammary folds. The nodules and abscesses may rupture and drain, leaving behind scars and hyperpigmentation.

The treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa is aimed at controlling inflammation and preventing recurrence. Topical corticosteroids are often used to reduce inflammation. Topical antimicrobials may be used to prevent secondary infection. Systemic antibiotics may be used in severe cases. In some cases, surgical excision of affected areas may be necessary.

In the case presented, the patient has a long history of a chronic, recurrent, and painful rash in the axillae. The rash is worse during the summers, and blisters sometimes develop. Emollients have been unhelpful. The patient has a family history of hidradenitis suppurativa. The physical examination findings are consistent with hidradenitis suppurativa. The biopsy findings are diagnostic of hidradenitis suppurativa.

The correct treatment for this patient is to prescribe a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial. The topical corticosteroid will help to reduce inflammation. The topical antimicrobial will help to prevent secondary infection. The patient should also be advised to keep the area clean and dry. He should avoid tight clothing and sweating. He should also avoid scratching the area.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Prescribe topical ketoconazole: Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication. It is not indicated for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.
* B. Obtain glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level: HbA1C is a blood test that measures the average amount of glucose in the blood over the past 2-3 months. It is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes mellitus. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest that he has diabetes mellitus. Therefore, there is no need to obtain an HbA1C level.
* D. Consult for surgical excision: Surgical excision is a treatment option for hidradenitis suppurativa, but it is not the first-line treatment. It is reserved for patients who do not respond to other treatments.

 48%|████▊     | 736/1525 [3:01:08<3:01:13, 13.78s/it]The correct diagnosis is halo scalp ring (pressure necrosis). This is a rare condition that occurs in newborns when the scalp is compressed against the birth canal during delivery. The pressure causes the skin to die, and a ring-shaped ulcer forms. The ulcer is typically nontender and does not drain.

Aplasia cutis congenita is a condition in which there is an absence of skin at birth. It can occur anywhere on the body, but is most common on the scalp. The lesion is typically smooth and round, and does not have a well-defined border.

Cellulitis and abscess associated with neonatal group B streptococcal infection is a serious infection that can occur in newborns. It is caused by the bacterium Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The infection can cause fever, swelling, and redness of the skin. In severe cases, it can lead to sepsis and death.

Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to blister easily. The blisters can be caused by minor trauma, such as rubbing or scratching. The condition can be life-threatening if the blisters become infected.

In the case of the newborn described in the question, the most likely diagnosis is halo scalp ring (pressure necrosis). This is because the baby had a prolonged labor and delivery, which increased the risk of pressure necrosis. The baby also had a cephalohematoma, which is a collection of blood under the scalp that can cause pressure necrosis. The baby's scalp lesion was nontender and did not drain, which are typical features of halo scalp ring.

Aplasia cutis congenita is less likely because the baby did not have any other features of the condition, such as a smooth, round lesion with a well-defined border. Cellulitis and abscess associated with neonatal group B streptococcal infection is also less likely because the baby did not have any fever, swelling, or redness of the skin. Epidermolysis bullosa is the least likely diagnosis because the baby did not have any blisters.

It is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the subcutaneous fat. The patient in the case presented with a history of pancreatitis, which is a strong risk factor for pancreatic panniculitis. The patient also had tender, pink to purple nodules and plaques on his bilateral lower legs, which are characteristic of pancreatic panniculitis. The histopathologic images of the biopsy specimen showed superficial and deep, dermal and perivascular inflammation, fibrosis, and fat necrosis, which are also characteristic of pancreatic panniculitis. Erythema nodosum is a common inflammatory condition that can cause tender nodules on the lower legs. However, it is not associated with pancreatitis. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis is a rare condition that can cause panniculitis in patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. However, the patient in the case did not have alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can cause panniculitis. However, the patient in the case did not have any systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or fatigue, which are common in polyarteritis nodosa. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pancreatic panniculitis.

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that primarily affects the genital and perianal areas in women, but can also occur on the trunk, arms, and legs. It is characterized by white, atrophic papules and plaques that are often pruritic. The lesions are usually folliculocentric, meaning that they occur around hair follicles.

LSA is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it is made after other possible causes of the lesions have been ruled out. The most common differential diagnosis for LSA is lichen planus, which is a similar condition that can also cause white, atrophic papules. However, lichen planus is not usually folliculocentric, and it is often associated with oral lesions.

The treatment of LSA is aimed at reducing inflammation and relieving pruritus. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment, but they may not be effective in all cases. In severe cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications may be necessary.

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a chronic condition that can be difficult to treat. However, with appropriate management, the symptoms can be controlled and the progression of the disease can be slowed.

Here are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Lichen amyloidosis is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid protein in the skin. It is characterized by waxy, yellow papules and plaques that are often pruritic. The lesions are usually not folliculocentric.
* Guttate vitiligo is a form of vitiligo characterized by the sudden appearance of small, white spots on the skin. It is most common in children and young adults. The lesions are not folliculocentric.
* Eruptive tumors of the follicular infundibulum are a rare, benign skin condition characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple, small, red papules on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The lesions are not folliculocentric.

 48%|████▊     | 739/1525 [3:01:51<3:06:50, 14.26s/it]The correct answer is B. Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome). BOR syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the ears, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by hearing loss, kidney problems, and branchial cleft cysts or fistulas. Branchial cleft cysts are abnormal openings that can develop in the neck, and branchial cleft fistulas are abnormal channels that can connect the neck to the throat.

The patient in this case has a number of features that are consistent with BOR syndrome. He has hearing loss, which is a common feature of the disorder. He also has a preauricular sinus and ear pit, which are abnormal openings that can develop in the front of the ear. Finally, he has a pedunculated, skin-colored papule on the right lateral neck, which is a type of skin lesion that can be associated with BOR syndrome.

Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by progressive kidney failure, hearing loss, and eye problems. Goldenhar syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral spectrum) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes, ears, face, and spine. Papillorenal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and eyes.

All of these disorders can cause hearing loss, but they do not typically cause the other features that are present in this case. Therefore, BOR syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.

Here are some additional details about each of the incorrect answer choices:

* Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by progressive kidney failure, hearing loss, and eye problems. The patient in this case does not have any kidney problems, so Alport syndrome is not the most likely diagnosis.
* Goldenhar syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral spectrum) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the eyes, ears, face, and spine. The patient in this case has hearing loss and a preauricular sinus and ear pit, but he does not have any other features of Goldenhar syndrome. Therefore, Goldenhar syndrome is not the most likely diagnosis.
* Papillorenal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and eyes. The patient in this case does not have any kidney problems, so papillorenal syndrome is not the most likely diagnosis.

 49%|████▊     | 740/1525 [3:02:07<3:14:25, 14.86s/it]The correct answer is B. Hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis.

The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism who had been taking warfarin for the last 20 years. He presented with 1 day of severe abdominal pain, which began after eating dinner. The pain had no associated nausea, vomiting, or obstipation. On examination, he was afebrile and had a normal heart rate but was notably hypotensive. He was given 2 L of crystalloid, and his blood pressure responded appropriately. His physical examination showed an abdomen that was soft but diffusely tender without rebound or guarding. He had a well-healed appendectomy scar. Blood testing revealed an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), an elevated lactate level of 29.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.111), an international normalized ratio of 4.6, a lowered hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and a lowered hematocrit level of 27.2%; all other results were unremarkable. Given his coagulopathy, low hematocrit level, and abdominal pain, a computed tomography angiogram was performed to rule out bleeding.

The computed tomography angiogram revealed gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder, high-density material within the lumen, and free intraperitoneal fluid. The axial cross-section computed tomography with intravenous contrast was significant for a blush of contrast within the lumen of the gallbladder and surrounding hyperemia of the liver at the gallbladder fossa.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis. The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to the inflammation and irritation of the gallbladder caused by the gallstones. The patient's hypotension is likely due to the loss of blood from the perforation of the gallbladder. The patient's elevated creatinine level is likely due to the dehydration caused by the loss of blood. The patient's elevated lactate level is likely due to the anaerobic metabolism that occurs in the body when there is a lack of oxygen. The patient's elevated international normalized ratio is likely due to the warfarin that he is taking. The patient's lowered hemoglobin level and hematocrit level are likely due to the loss of blood from the perforation of the gallbladder.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Anaphylactic shock secondary to ruptured echinococcal cyst is incorrect because the patient does not have any history of allergies and there is no evidence of anaphylaxis on physical examination.
* Hemorrhagic shock secondary to spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage is incorrect because the patient has a history of gallstones and the computed tomography angiogram shows gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder.
* Septic shock secondary to perforated cholecystitis is incorrect because the patient does not have any evidence of infection on physical examination or laboratory findings.

 49%|████▊     | 741/1525 [3:02:23<3:15:29, 14.96s/it]The correct answer is B. Coronary steal syndrome.

The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) in 1997. In 2014, he experienced angina that resolved following placement of a drug-eluting stent in his LAD. The coronary angiography via the left femoral artery shows that the LIMA graft is patent, but there is a significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery. This stenosis is causing a steal phenomenon, where blood is being diverted from the LAD to the subclavian artery. This is causing the patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication.

The other choices are incorrect. A. Normal coronary angiography is incorrect because the coronary angiography shows that the LIMA graft is patent, but there is a significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery. C. Subclavian steal syndrome is incorrect because the patient does not have symptoms of subclavian steal syndrome, such as unilateral arm claudication and paresthesias. D. Subclavian stenosis is incorrect because the patient has a significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery, which is causing a steal phenomenon.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Coronary steal syndrome.

The patient in the case presented with progressive dimming of vision, unintentional weight loss, fevers, and subacute visual decline. Subsequent ophthalmic examination revealed mild anterior and posterior inflammation, raising suspicion for panuveitis. Results of laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis were negative. However, a right upper lobe lung mass noted on the chest radiograph proved to be T2N2M0 stage III non–small-cell lung cancer on biopsy.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), a paraneoplastic syndrome that can occur in patients with systemic cancer. CAR is characterized by the bilateral development of retinal pigment epithelial changes, subretinal fluid, and macular edema. The exact pathogenesis of CAR is unknown, but it is thought to be mediated by circulating immune complexes that deposit in the retina.

The treatment of CAR is supportive and includes the use of systemic steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, plasmapheresis may be beneficial. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma or albumin. This procedure can help to remove circulating immune complexes and improve visual function.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choroidal biopsy of the right eye lesion is not indicated in this case because the patient has already had a biopsy of the right upper lobe lung mass that proved to be T2N2M0 stage III non–small-cell lung cancer.
* Pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid is not indicated in this case because the patient has diffuse retinal pigment epithelial alterations and focal choroidal pigmented lesions, not a discrete subretinal lesion.
* Bilateral external-beam radiotherapy is not indicated in this case because the patient has CAR, not a primary ocular malignancy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Refer for serial plasmapheresis.

A. Initiate oral colchicine therapy is incorrect because colchicine is a medication used to treat gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. It is also not indicated for the treatment of conjunctival nodules.

B. Observe with serial examinations is incorrect because the lesion has been present for 1 month and has not improved with topical antibiotics or oral sulindac. A biopsy is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the lesion and to rule out malignancy.

D. Perform intralesional dexamethasone injection is incorrect because intralesional injections of steroids are not effective for the treatment of conjunctival nodules. They may actually worsen the condition by causing inflammation and scarring.

Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate treatment for a conjunctival nodule in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition.

 49%|████▉     | 744/1525 [3:03:09<3:15:17, 15.00s/it]The correct answer is A. Observe or perform laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion.

The patient in this case has persistent angiographic abnormalities after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (IVATE) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). These abnormalities include significant peripheral retinal avascularity, circumferential vascular loops at the border of vascular and avascular retina, and arteriovenous anastomoses. There is no evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrence of ROP.

The goal of treatment for ROP is to prevent retinal detachment. In the past, this was done with laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion. However, IVATE has become the preferred treatment for ROP because it is more effective and has fewer side effects than laser photocoagulation.

In some cases, IVATE may not be successful in preventing retinal detachment. In these cases, laser photocoagulation may be necessary to treat the areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion. However, in the case presented here, there is no evidence of retinal detachment, so laser photocoagulation is not necessary at this time.

The patient should be monitored closely for signs of retinal detachment. If retinal detachment occurs, it will need to be treated with laser photocoagulation or surgery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy again. This is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of retinal detachment.
* C. Administer combined intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation to areas of nonperfusion. This is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of retinal detachment.
* D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy. This is a surgical procedure that is used to treat retinal detachment. It is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of retinal detachment.

 49%|████▉     | 745/1525 [3:03:19<2:57:08, 13.63s/it]The correct answer is C: Observe.

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent, transient vision loss in the right eye. The episodes always develop after using her electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side. Notably, the patient reported immediate resolution of vision loss on turning on the lights. She denied headaches, visual aura, or neurologic symptoms. Her other medical history was unremarkable.

Six months prior to presentation, workup at her local hospital for the transient vision loss revealed an enhancing right orbital mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Carotid ultrasonography and head magnetic resonance angiography showed no abnormalities. Inflammatory marker levels were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging 3 months later showed a stable mass without change in size or appearance.

On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and motility were unremarkable. Anterior segment examination showed mild cataract and dry eye. Posterior pole examination revealed evidence of posterior vitreous detachment and normal optic nerves with 0.2 cup-to-disc ratio in each eye. The retina was flat without evidence of whitening or Hollenhorst plaques. Humphrey visual fields were full. Normal retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layer thickness were observed in each eye on optical coherence tomography. Computed tomography of the head revealed no change in orbital lesion size with Valsalva maneuver.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). NAION is a common cause of vision loss in older adults, and it is typically associated with sudden, painless vision loss in one eye. The exact cause of NAION is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve.

The diagnosis of NAION is made based on the patient's history and clinical findings. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan, may be helpful to rule out other causes of vision loss, but they are not necessary for the diagnosis of NAION.

There is no specific treatment for NAION. Treatment is aimed at reducing the risk of further vision loss. This may include medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and quitting caffeine.

In most cases, the vision loss from NAION is permanent. However, some patients may experience some improvement in their vision over time.

The patient in this case should be observed closely for any changes in her vision. She should also be advised to stop using her electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side. She should also be advised to make lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and quitting caffeine.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Perform echocardiogram and Holter monitoring is incorrect because there is no evidence of cardiovascular disease in this patient.
* Option B: Biopsy orbital mass is incorrect because there is no evidence of malignancy in this patient.
* Option D: Perform hypercoagulability workup is incorrect because there is no evidence of hypercoagulability in this patient.

The patient has a history of restricted movements of the left eye since birth, which has been diagnosed as having an orbital capillary hemangioma. The patient was treated with oral propranolol with no improvement. On examination, the patient has inferior displacement of the left globe with a severe limitation of supraduction and a mild limitation of horizontal movement in the left eye. He is unable to maintain fixation with the left eye. Results of modified Krimsky testing showed 6 prism diopters (PD) of exotropia and 16 PD of left hypotropia. Retinoscopy disclosed a cycloplegic refraction of +2.00 diopters (D) in the right eye and +6.00 D in the left eye. Thyrotropin, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels were all within reference ranges. Repeated MRI with coronal images showed massive enlargement of the superior, inferior, and medial rectus muscles. The medial rectus mass extended nasally to produce bowing of the lamina papyrecea, with no extension into adjacent structures. The enlarged extraocular muscles were hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. An abnormal curvilinear signal in the intraconal fat was isointense with muscle.

A. Investigate for systemic involvement is incorrect because the patient has no history or symptoms of systemic involvement.
B. Genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles is incorrect because the patient's MRI findings are not consistent with congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles.
C. Strabismus surgery is incorrect because the patient's strabismus is secondary to a mass in the orbit, and strabismus surgery would not address the underlying cause of the problem.
D. Orbital biopsy is the correct answer because it is the only option that will provide a definitive diagnosis of the patient's condition.

Orbital biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the orbit. The tissue is then examined under a microscope to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Orbital biopsy is a safe and effective procedure that can provide a definitive diagnosis of a variety of orbital conditions, including orbital tumors, inflammatory disorders, and infections.

The patient has recurrent uveitis after YAG capsulotomy. The uveitis is caused by Propionibacterium acnes, which is an organism that can live on the surface of the intraocular lens. The first step in treating this infection is to remove the intraocular lens. This will remove the source of the infection and allow the eye to heal. Once the intraocular lens is removed, the anterior capsule of the lens is removed. This is done to remove any bacteria that may be living on the capsule. Finally, intravitreal vancomycin is injected into the eye. This will kill any remaining bacteria in the eye.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Prescribe topical moxifloxacin and consult an infectious diseases specialist. This option is incorrect because topical moxifloxacin is not effective against Propionibacterium acnes. Additionally, consulting an infectious diseases specialist is not necessary in this case.
* Option B: Perform another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection. This option is incorrect because the previous vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection did not resolve the infection. Additionally, performing another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection would be more invasive than simply removing the intraocular lens.
* Option D: Inject intravitreal vancomycin and administer systemic vancomycin and prednisone. This option is incorrect because intravitreal vancomycin is not effective against Propionibacterium acnes. Additionally, administering systemic vancomycin and prednisone is not necessary in this case.

The patient is a woman in her 20s who presents with a 2-month history of gradually worsening pruritic plaques that initially involved the scalp, face, and neck, and later affected the anterior and posterior chest wall, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs; she also had nodules over the nose and cheeks. The lesions were thought to be exfoliative dermatitis secondary to valproic acid and phenytoin, but her condition worsened despite changing her medication. A biopsy specimen showed dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism. The results from a second biopsy specimen were consistent with the suspected diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic, T-cell lymphoma characterized by recurrent crops of papules and nodules. The lesions are typically small, 1-2 cm in diameter, and are often pruritic. The most common sites of involvement are the trunk and extremities. Lymphomatoid papulosis is usually a self-limited disease, but it can occasionally progress to a more aggressive form of lymphoma.

Reactive lymphomatoid reaction secondary to drugs is a rare condition that can occur in patients who are taking certain medications, such as sulfa drugs, penicillin, and barbiturates. The condition is characterized by a skin rash that is similar to mycosis fungoides. However, reactive lymphomatoid reaction secondary to drugs is usually a self-limited disease that resolves when the offending medication is discontinued.

Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma is a rare, aggressive form of lymphoma that is characterized by the accumulation of malignant T-cells in the blood and bone marrow. The most common symptoms of adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma are fever, weight loss, and fatigue. The disease can also cause lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma is usually fatal, although there are some effective treatment options available.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is mycosis fungoides. The patient's history of gradually worsening pruritic plaques that initially involved the scalp, face, and neck, and later affected the anterior and posterior chest wall, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs; her nodules over the nose and cheeks; and the results of the biopsy specimens are all consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. The other possible diagnoses, lymphomatoid papulosis, reactive lymphomatoid reaction secondary to drugs, and adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma, are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination.

Cor triatriatum is a congenital heart defect in which the left atrium is divided into two chambers by a membrane or web. This can cause obstruction of blood flow to the left ventricle and pulmonary artery. The patient in the case presented with symptoms of dyspnea and palpitations, which are consistent with cor triatriatum. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a membrane in the left atrium, which is diagnostic of cor triatriatum. The transesophageal echocardiogram further confirmed the diagnosis and showed that the membrane was obstructing blood flow to the left ventricle. The patient was managed with surgery to resect the membrane and relieve the obstruction. The patient's symptoms improved after surgery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Manage the patient medically and perform repeated transthoracic echocardiography in 6 months. This is not the correct management for cor triatriatum. Cor triatriatum is a congenital heart defect that requires surgical intervention. Medical management alone is not sufficient to treat cor triatriatum.
* Option B: Perform transcatheter balloon mitral valvuloplasty. This is not the correct management for cor triatriatum. Transcatheter balloon mitral valvuloplasty is a procedure that is used to treat mitral valve stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis is a condition in which the mitral valve is narrowed, which can cause obstruction of blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Cor triatriatum is a different condition that is not caused by mitral valve stenosis.
* Option C: Perform surgical mitral valve repair and annuloplasty. This is not the correct management for cor triatriatum. Surgical mitral valve repair and annuloplasty are procedures that are used to treat mitral valve regurgitation. Mitral valve regurgitation is a condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly, which can cause blood to flow back from the left ventricle to the left atrium. Cor triatriatum is a different condition that is not caused by mitral valve regurgitation.
* Option D: Perform surgical left atriotomy and membrane resection. This is the correct management for cor triatriatum. Surgical left atriotomy and membrane resection is a procedure that is used to resect the membrane that is obstructing blood flow to the left ventricle. This procedure is the only way to treat cor triatriatum.

Dermoid tumors are congenital tumors that are composed of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal tissues. They are most commonly found in the midline of the head and neck, and are typically benign. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the nasopharynx, which is the upper part of the throat. It is the most common type of cancer of the head and neck in Asia, but is relatively rare in other parts of the world. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that are composed of blood vessels. They are the most common type of vascular tumor in children, and are typically found on the skin or mucous membranes.

The patient in this case is a 3-year-old boy who presented with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. He had no reported respiratory issues at birth and no feeding difficulties. His symptoms included gasping and apneic episodes at night, as well as nighttime nasal congestion. He had been evaluated by an outside otolaryngologist, who had scheduled an adenoidectomy. Intraoperatively, he was found to have a nasopharyngeal mass, and thus surgery was aborted. Nasal endoscopy in clinic revealed a firm, mobile mass in the nasopharynx. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 21 × 14 × 18-mm irregular, but well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left nasopharynx with increased perfusion. Given the vascularity of the tumor, the boy underwent preoperative embolization with interventional radiology. He was subsequently taken to the operating room, where endoscopic resection of the mass and division of the pedicle were performed without complication. Final pathologic results demonstrated keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma, with small nests of primitive mesenchyme.

The patient's symptoms, the location of the mass, and the imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of salivary gland anlage tumor. Salivary gland anlage tumors are rare tumors that are typically found in children. They are thought to arise from remnants of embryonic salivary gland tissue. Most salivary gland anlage tumors are benign, but some can be malignant. The treatment of salivary gland anlage tumors is surgical resection.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Dermoid tumors are typically found in the midline of the head and neck, and are not associated with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing.
* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that typically presents with symptoms such as neck pain, headache, and epistaxis.
* Hemangiomas are benign tumors that are composed of blood vessels, and are not associated with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing.

The stone can also become infected, which can lead to fever and other symptoms.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the salivary glands. It is not the most likely cause of a hard swelling on the inner cheek.

Intraoral lipoma is a benign tumor that can occur in the mouth. It is not the most likely cause of a hard swelling on the inner cheek.

Unusual mucocele is a rare type of mucocele that can occur in the mouth. It is not the most likely cause of a hard swelling on the inner cheek.

In this case, the patient has a hard swelling on the inner cheek that is associated with pain and swelling. The patient also has a history of biting his cheek. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sialolith. The other choices are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

 49%|████▉     | 752/1525 [3:05:05<3:07:49, 14.58s/it]The correct diagnosis is hypoglossal nerve schwannoma. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient is a woman in her 30s with a history of bruxism and long-term use of a bite guard. This is a risk factor for hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.
* The patient presented with pain centering on the left submandibular area for 2 years. This is a common symptom of hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.
* Physical examination revealed a mild firmness in the left submandibular area. This is a common finding in hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.
* Cranial nerve function, including tongue mobility and sensation, was also normal. This is important because hypoglossal nerve schwannoma can cause tongue paralysis.
* Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 1.7 × 1.5 × 1.4-cm mass, adjacent to the left submandibular gland. This is a typical finding in hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.
* An ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was nondiagnostic owing to an inability to obtain sufficient tissue. This is not surprising, as hypoglossal nerve schwannomas are often difficult to biopsy.
* The patient underwent surgical exploration with left submandibular gland excision and resection of the left submandibular mass. Histopathologic findings showed spindle cell neoplasm with morphologic features and no malignant neoplasm identified. This is a typical finding in hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.
* Results from immunohistochemical analysis were positive for S100 and negative for smooth muscle actin, CD34, and pankeratin. This is a characteristic finding of hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is hypoglossal nerve schwannoma. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy findings.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor of the submandibular gland. It is the most common type of tumor of the submandibular gland. It is typically a slow-growing, painless mass. It is not associated with bruxism or a history of long-term use of a bite guard.
* Chronic lymphadenitis is a non-cancerous inflammation of the lymph nodes. It is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of infections. It is typically a painless mass that is not associated with bruxism or a history of long-term use of a bite guard.
* Chronic submandibular sialadenitis is a non-cancerous inflammation of the submandibular gland. It is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including obstruction of the salivary duct, infection, and autoimmune disease. It is typically a painful mass that is not associated with bruxism or a history of long-term use of a bite guard.

The patient has been taking esomeprazole for several months without improvement. She has no evidence of esophageal mucosal damage, so increasing the dose of esomeprazole or adding famotidine is unlikely to be helpful. A barium esophagogram is a radiographic study that can be used to visualize the esophagus and stomach. It is not indicated in this case, as the patient has already had an EGD that showed no evidence of esophageal abnormalities. Referral to a surgeon for antireflux surgery is also not indicated, as the patient has not had any complications from her GERD.

Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating refractory GERD. It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach. In this case, it is the most likely treatment to improve the patient's symptoms.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Increase esomeprazole to 40 mg twice daily.

This is not the best option because the patient has already been taking esomeprazole for several months without improvement. Increasing the dose is unlikely to be helpful.

* B. Perform a barium esophagogram.

This is not the best option because the patient has already had an EGD that showed no evidence of esophageal abnormalities. A barium esophagogram is a radiographic study that can be used to visualize the esophagus and stomach. It is not indicated in this case, as the patient has already had an EGD that showed no evidence of esophageal abnormalities.

* C. Refer to a surgeon for antireflux surgery.

This is not the best option because the patient has not had any complications from her GERD. Referral to a surgeon for antireflux surgery is only indicated for patients who have severe GERD that is not responsive to medical therapy.

* D. Replace esomeprazole with nortriptyline.

This is the best option because nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating refractory GERD. It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach. In this case, it is the most likely treatment to improve the patient's symptoms.

A swab and culture would not be helpful in this case because the nodule is not likely to be caused by an infection. The nodule is more likely to be a tumor, and a biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis.

Wound care for barrier protection may be necessary if the nodule is a skin lesion, but it is not the first step in the management of this patient. A biopsy is necessary to determine the cause of the nodule and to guide further treatment.

Topical steroids would not be helpful in this case because the nodule is not likely to be an inflammatory condition. Topical steroids can be used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, but they are not effective against tumors.

A biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of the nodule and to guide further treatment. The nodule is more likely to be a tumor, and a biopsy is necessary to determine the type of tumor and to determine whether it is malignant or benign. If the tumor is malignant, further treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may be necessary.

This is a chronic, relapsing, papulosquamous eruption that typically affects children and young adults. The lesions are typically annular or polycyclic, with a raised, erythematous border and a central clearing. They may be pruritic, and they can occur anywhere on the body.

The histopathology of ALDY is characteristic, with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis. There may also be vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction and mild lymphocytic exocytosis.

There is no specific treatment for ALDY, but it is often self-limiting. Topical corticosteroids may be helpful in controlling the pruritus and inflammation. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pigmented purpuric dermatosis is a vascular disorder that typically affects older adults. The lesions are typically purpuric macules and papules that occur on the lower extremities. There is no lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis on histopathology.
* Mycosis fungoides is a type of T-cell lymphoma that typically affects adults. The lesions are typically erythematous patches, plaques, or tumors. There is a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis on histopathology, as well as a characteristic Pautrier microabscess.

Erythema induratum is a chronic, relapsing, panniculitis characterized by tender, indurated plaques and ulcers on the lower legs. It is most commonly seen in women of middle age and older, and is associated with a variety of conditions, including tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, and venous insufficiency.

The patient in the case presentation is an 82-year-old Chinese woman who presented with a 6-month history of a nonhealing ulcer and multiple indurated plaques on the legs. The first lesion appeared as an erythematous papule, which grew and subsequently ulcerated. Within a few months, she developed other indurated plaques on her legs. The ulcer was painful on palpation, but the plaques were mostly asymptomatic. The patient did not have fevers, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis. She had moved to Canada from China 30 years ago and was unsure about tuberculosis (TB) exposure and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine status. Her medical history included atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and Parkinson disease. Physical examination showed a 5 × 4-cm, well-demarcated, oval ulcer with a violaceous, dusky border and central yellow fibrin mixed with granulation tissue on the left lateral aspect of the calf. There were numerous violaceous to dull red, indurated plaques on the posterior aspect of the legs. Wound cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of erythema induratum. The most common cause of erythema induratum is tuberculosis, but it can also be associated with other conditions, such as Crohn's disease, venous insufficiency, and sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of erythema induratum is based on the clinical presentation, with confirmation by biopsy. Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause, if known, and symptomatic relief.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Infective panniculitides is a group of disorders that cause inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. It can be caused by a variety of infections, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The patient in the case presentation does not have any signs or symptoms of an infection, and her wound cultures were negative.
* Erythema nodosum is a panniculitis that is characterized by tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities. It is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, and with pregnancy. The patient in the case presentation does not have any history of inflammatory bowel disease or pregnancy.
* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic, noninfectious skin condition that is characterized by painful ulcers that often have a violaceous border. It is associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Erythema ab igne is a condition that causes reddish-brown or black discoloration of the skin due to prolonged exposure to heat. It is most commonly seen in people who use heating pads or space heaters. The patient in this case denied use of heating pads, space heaters, or other forms of external radiation.

Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, chronic, progressive, inflammatory skin disease characterized by hyperpigmented macules and papules that coalesce to form plaques. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities. The patient in this case does not have the typical clinical presentation of Dowling-Degos disease.

Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by confluent, reticulated, papillomatous lesions on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are typically pruritic and may be associated with pain and tenderness. The patient in this case does not have the typical clinical presentation of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.

Prurigo pigmentosa is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by discrete, erythematous, scaly papules admixed with light brown reticulated macules and patches. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities. The patient in this case has a history of recurrent, pruritic skin eruptions involving the middle and lower back. She has also undergone a skin biopsy that showed spongiotic dermatitis, had patch testing that was reportedly negative, and received a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. She was treated with potent topical corticosteroids and oral prednisone, with no improvement. The clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and treatment history of the patient are consistent with a diagnosis of prurigo pigmentosa.

 50%|████▉     | 759/1525 [3:06:46<3:04:00, 14.41s/it]The correct answer is C. Germinoma.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a germinoma, a type of germ cell tumor that typically occurs in the pineal gland or the suprasellar region. Germinomas are the most common type of germ cell tumor in the central nervous system (CNS), and they account for approximately 60% of all germ cell tumors in children.

The patient's history and physical examination are also consistent with a germinoma. The patient's cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and progressively worsening weakness of the left arm and leg are all common symptoms of a germinoma. The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with a germinoma. The lesion in the right basal ganglia is nonhomogeneous, which is a typical finding for germinomas. The lesion is also enhancing, which means that it is taking up contrast material. This is a characteristic finding of germinomas.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with a germinoma. The patient's human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels are normal. This is important because HCG is a hormone that is often elevated in patients with germ cell tumors. The patient's hormone assay also disclosed normal pituitary function. This is important because germinomas can sometimes cause pituitary dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation, physical examination, MRI findings, and laboratory findings are all consistent with a germinoma. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Germinoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Glioma is a type of brain tumor that can occur in any part of the brain. Gliomas are the most common type of brain tumor in adults. The patient's presentation, physical examination, MRI findings, and laboratory findings are not consistent with a glioma.
* Infarction is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery in the brain. Infarctions can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, paralysis, and vision problems. The patient's presentation, physical examination, MRI findings, and laboratory findings are not consistent with an infarction.
* Demyelination is a condition that occurs when the myelin sheaths that protect nerve cells are damaged. Demyelination can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, paralysis, and vision problems. The patient's presentation, physical examination, MRI findings, and laboratory findings are not consistent with demyelination.

 50%|████▉     | 760/1525 [3:07:02<3:09:15, 14.84s/it]The correct answer is Waardenburg syndrome type 1. This is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the inner ear and eyes. It is characterized by a lateral displacement of the inner canthi (the corners of the eyes), a broad nasal root, small nostrils, and medial eyebrow flare. Other features that may be present include hearing loss, heterochromia (different colored eyes), hypopigmentation (loss of skin pigment), and skeletal abnormalities.

The most common type of Waardenburg syndrome is type 1, which is caused by a mutation in the PAX3 gene. This gene is responsible for the development of the inner ear and eyes. The mutation causes the cells in these areas to develop abnormally, which can lead to hearing loss and other problems.

Waardenburg syndrome type 1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that if one parent has the mutation, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit it.

There is no cure for Waardenburg syndrome, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Hearing loss can be treated with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Other symptoms, such as heterochromia, can be treated with cosmetic surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Stickler syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. It is characterized by joint pain, hearing loss, and eye problems. However, it does not cause a lateral displacement of the inner canthi.
* X-linked Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by progressive kidney failure, hearing loss, and eye problems. However, it does not cause a lateral displacement of the inner canthi.
* Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation is the most common cause of hereditary hearing loss. It is caused by a mutation in the GJB2 gene, which is responsible for the production of a protein called connexin 26. Connexin 26 is essential for the function of the inner ear. However, a mutation in this gene can lead to hearing loss.

* The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
* The patient's colonoscopy showed multiple areas of inflammation in the rectum through the descending colon, which is consistent with adenocarcinoma.
* The patient's computed tomographic scan showed a thickened colon from the middescending colon to the rectosigmoid, with a 2.7-cm intramural abscess in the descending colon. This is also consistent with adenocarcinoma.
* The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, emesis, and inability to tolerate oral intake, are also consistent with adenocarcinoma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Ulcerative colitis flare is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more severe than would be expected with a simple flare. Conversion to Crohn disease is also a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are not typical of Crohn disease. Lymphoma is a rare cause of colorectal cancer, and the patient's symptoms are not typical of lymphoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

A vitreous tap and inject is not the correct answer because it would not provide a definitive diagnosis. A vitreous tap and inject is a procedure in which a small amount of fluid is removed from the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye. This fluid is then sent to a laboratory for testing. However, a vitreous tap and inject cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of a retinal lesion. The only way to get a definitive diagnosis is to perform a subretinal biopsy.

A change in systemic antimicrobials is not the correct answer because the patient is already receiving prophylactic antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics are antibiotics that are given to prevent infection. In this case, the patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection from the Candida tropicalis that was found on his skin biopsy. However, the Candida tropicalis is not the cause of the patient's retinal lesions. The retinal lesions are most likely caused by the patient's leukemia.

A lumbar puncture is not the correct answer because it would not provide a definitive diagnosis. A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid is then sent to a laboratory for testing. However, a lumbar puncture cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of a retinal lesion. The only way to get a definitive diagnosis is to perform a subretinal biopsy.

A pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy is the correct answer because it is the only procedure that can provide a definitive diagnosis of the patient's retinal lesions. A pars plana vitrectomy is a procedure in which a small incision is made in the sclera, the white outer layer of the eye. A small instrument is then inserted through the incision to remove the vitreous humor. The vitreous humor is then replaced with a saline solution. A subretinal biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the retina. This tissue is then sent to a laboratory for testing. A subretinal biopsy is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis of a retinal lesion.

The patient in the case has a large extraconal metallic foreign body (FB) within the right orbit that is abutting the inferior rectus muscle without fractures or intracranial intrusion. The FB is a potential source of infection and inflammation, and it can also cause damage to the optic nerve and other structures within the orbit. Therefore, the FB should be removed as soon as possible.

An orbitotomy is the most direct and effective way to remove an FB from the orbit. It involves making an incision through the skin and bone of the orbit, and then using a surgical microscope to remove the FB. The canalicular lacerations should also be repaired at the time of the orbitotomy.

The other options are incorrect. Observing the patient would not be appropriate, as the FB is a potential source of infection and inflammation. Obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging study would not be necessary, as the diagnosis is already clear with the computed tomography scan. Repairing the canalicular lacerations without removing the FB would not address the underlying problem, and it could potentially lead to infection.

The patient presented with acute monocular vision loss in a young adult. The most common cause of acute monocular vision loss in a young adult is a retinal vein occlusion. Retinal vein occlusions can be caused by a number of factors, including hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases. Therefore, the first step in the management of a patient with acute monocular vision loss is to review their medical and family history for these conditions.

Intravitreal corticosteroid injection is a treatment option for retinal vein occlusion, but it is not the first-line treatment. Intravitreal corticosteroid injections are only indicated for patients who have severe visual loss or who have a poor prognosis for visual recovery.

Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection is another treatment option for retinal vein occlusion, but it is also not the first-line treatment. Intravitreal anti–VEGF injections are only indicated for patients who have macular edema.

Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment option for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, but it is not the treatment of choice for retinal vein occlusion. Panretinal photocoagulation is only indicated for patients who have neovascularization of the optic disc or of the retina.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Review medical and family history for hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases. The other choices are incorrect because they are not the first-line treatments for retinal vein occlusion.

The patient's history of cigarette use (≥80 pack-years) and alcohol dependence, combined with his clinical presentation of several weeks of left eye pain and redness, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and cough with scant sputum, is highly suggestive of tuberculosis (TB). The results of serologic tests, including Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay, HIV, hepatitis B and C, Lyme antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative, which makes these other possible causes of the patient's symptoms less likely. The results of proteinase 3–antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing and interferon γ release assay using QuantiFERON-TB gold (QFT) (Qiagen) were positive, which are both highly specific for TB. The chest computed tomography revealed tiny, scattered solid pulmonary nodules that were too small to characterize according to the radiology department. The patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic, where the results of sputum culture and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacteria tuberculosis were negative. Pulmonology evaluation determined that the pulmonary nodules were too small for biopsy via bronchoscopy.

Given the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is TB of the eye. The treatment of TB of the eye is with RIPE therapy, which consists of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This regimen is effective against the vast majority of strains of M. tuberculosis. The patient should be started on RIPE therapy as soon as possible, as TB of the eye can be sight-threatening if not treated promptly.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform an incisional biopsy is not the correct answer because the patient's pulmonary nodules were too small for biopsy via bronchoscopy.
* B. Prescribe oral prednisone is not the correct answer because steroids are not effective against TB.
* D. Inject sub-Tenon triamcinolone is not the correct answer because steroids are not effective against TB.

DSRCT is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of small, round cells that are positive for cytokeratin and desmin but negative for S100. FISH testing is often used to confirm the diagnosis, as it is positive for EWS-WT1 rearrangement in the majority of cases.

The clinical presentation of DSRCT is variable, but most patients present with a mass in the abdomen or pelvis. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. The disease can spread to the lungs, liver, bone, and lymph nodes.

There is no cure for DSRCT, but treatment can help to control the disease and improve survival. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma: This is a type of cancer that can spread to the abdomen and pelvis from other parts of the body, such as the lung or pancreas. However, it is not typically associated with the presence of small, round cells that are positive for cytokeratin and desmin.
* Metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor: This is a type of cancer that can spread to the abdomen and pelvis from the stomach or small intestine. However, it is not typically associated with the presence of small, round cells that are positive for cytokeratin and desmin.

The patient in this case has a family history of sudden cardiac death, and she is experiencing palpitations, breathlessness, chest pain, and episodes of light-headedness. These symptoms are concerning for arrhythmias, which are abnormal heart rhythms.

An invasive electrophysiological study (EPS) is a procedure that involves inserting catheters into the heart to record electrical activity. This procedure can be used to diagnose arrhythmias and to guide treatment. However, EPS is an invasive procedure with some risks, such as bleeding and infection.

Implanting a device to determine the frequency of ventricular tachycardia is also an invasive procedure. This procedure involves placing a device in the chest that will monitor the heart rhythm. This information can be used to diagnose arrhythmias and to guide treatment. However, this procedure also has some risks, such as bleeding and infection.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive procedure that can be used to assess the structure and function of the heart. MRI can be used to diagnose arrhythmias, and it can also be used to identify the cause of arrhythmias. MRI is a safe and effective procedure with no known risks.

Therefore, the best course of action in this case is to order a cardiac MRI. This procedure will provide information about the structure and function of the heart, and it will help to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms.

The other choices are incorrect because they are either invasive procedures with some risks, or they are not as accurate as cardiac MRI in diagnosing arrhythmias.

A branchial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly that results from incomplete closure of the branchial arches during embryonic development. It is typically a small, non-tender, cystic mass that is located in the lateral neck. Branchial cleft cysts are most commonly diagnosed in children, but they can also occur in adults. The most common symptom of a branchial cleft cyst is a painless lump in the neck. The lump may increase in size over time, and it may become infected. Treatment for a branchial cleft cyst is surgical excision.

A glomus tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the glomus body, which is a small, specialized structure that regulates blood flow. Glomus tumors are most commonly found in the hands and feet, but they can also occur in the head and neck. The most common symptom of a glomus tumor is a painful, tender mass. Glomus tumors are typically treated with surgery.

A liposarcoma is a type of cancer that arises from fat cells. Liposarcomas are most commonly found in the abdomen, but they can also occur in the arms, legs, and trunk. The most common symptom of a liposarcoma is a painless mass. Liposarcomas are typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

A cervical lymphatic malformation is a congenital anomaly that results from abnormal development of the lymphatic system. Lymphatic malformations are typically classified as either cystic or venous. Cystic lymphatic malformations are characterized by the presence of one or more cysts that are filled with lymph fluid. Venous lymphatic malformations are characterized by the presence of abnormal veins that are filled with lymph fluid. Lymphatic malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most commonly found in the head and neck. The most common symptoms of a lymphatic malformation are a painless mass, swelling, and discomfort. Treatment for a lymphatic malformation depends on the size and location of the lesion, as well as the symptoms that are present. Surgical excision is the most common treatment, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be used.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 40s who presents with a giant, left-sided neck mass. The mass has been present for approximately 12 months and has been growing gradually and continuously. The patient experiences dyspnea, limitation of neck movements, and neck tightness owing to the bulkiness of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals a 15 × 7-cm homogenous ovoid bilobulated cystic mass in the left lateral region of the neck with displacement of the surrounding musculature and vascular structures but no sign of invasion. The imaging of the lesion revealed fibrous septae in the central and inferior parts, with extension to the supraclavicular region. After written informed consent was obtained, the patient underwent total excision of the cystic mass through an apron flap incision combined with T-incision for preservation of cranial nerve XI and sternocleidomastoid muscle. The pathologic examination of the excised mass revealed a cervical lymphatic malformation.

Based on the information presented, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical lymphatic malformation. The patient's age, the history of a slowly growing neck mass, the imaging findings, and the pathologic examination all support this diagnosis. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the information presented.

PTLD is a type of cancer that can occur in people who have received an organ transplant. It is caused by a reaction of the body's immune system to the transplanted organ. PTLD can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the lymph nodes, the gastrointestinal tract, and the skin.

The symptoms of PTLD can vary depending on the location of the tumor. In the case of the patient in the case study, the symptoms were nasopharyngeal swelling, throat pain, and snoring.

The diagnosis of PTLD is made based on a biopsy of the affected tissue. The biopsy will show the presence of abnormal cells that are characteristic of PTLD.

The treatment of PTLD depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage PTLD, treatment may consist of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In more advanced cases, treatment may also include a stem cell transplant.

The prognosis for PTLD is variable. The outcome depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis, the type of treatment, and the patient's overall health.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Mycobacterial abscess is a type of infection caused by bacteria. It is not a common complication of organ transplantation.
* C. Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is a type of infection caused by fungi. It is not a common complication of organ transplantation.
* D. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the nasopharynx. It is not a common complication of organ transplantation.

Florid osseous dysplasia is a rare, non-hereditary disorder of bone growth characterized by the development of multiple, benign, osteosclerotic lesions in the jaw and facial bones. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Paget disease of bone is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by the replacement of normal bone with abnormal bone tissue. The disease is most common in people over the age of 50 and can affect any bone in the body, but it is most commonly seen in the pelvis, skull, and spine. The symptoms of Paget disease of bone can vary depending on the location of the affected bones, but they may include bone pain, tenderness, and swelling. Treatment for Paget disease of bone may include medications, surgery, or radiation therapy.

Gardner syndrome is a rare, hereditary disorder characterized by the development of multiple polyps in the colon and other parts of the digestive system. The syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including colon cancer, thyroid cancer, and brain tumors. The symptoms of Gardner syndrome can vary depending on the individual, but they may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Treatment for Gardner syndrome may include surgery to remove the polyps, medications to reduce the risk of cancer, and regular screening for cancer.

In the case presented, the patient is an adolescent girl with a history of multiple, slowly growing masses of the face and head. The lesions were first reported when she was 5 years of age and gradually increased in size. The patient's medical history is otherwise unremarkable. On clinical examination, the lesions are hard in consistency with normal overlying skin. There is significant bilateral exophthalmos (the left eye is more pronounced), with visual changes, and dental malocclusion. However, there are no clinical signs of endocrinopathy. A skeletal survey showed no involvement of other bones. The patient’s serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, thyroid, and parathyroid hormone levels were within normal limits. A computed tomographic (CT) examination of the craniofacial skeleton was performed. The CT images show multiple, well-circumscribed, osteolytic lesions in the facial bones.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign, monostotic or polyostotic disorder of bone characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. The disease is most commonly seen in children and young adults and affects the long bones, pelvis, ribs, and skull. The symptoms of fibrous dysplasia can vary depending on the location of the affected bones, but they may include pain, tenderness, swelling, and deformity. Treatment for fibrous dysplasia may include observation, surgery, or radiation therapy.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are florid osseous dysplasia, Paget disease of bone, and Gardner syndrome. However, these diagnoses are less likely than fibrous dysplasia based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

Florid osseous dysplasia is a rare, non-hereditary disorder of bone growth characterized by the development of multiple, benign, osteosclerotic lesions in the jaw and facial bones. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. In the case presented, the patient has multiple, osteolytic lesions in the facial bones, which is not consistent with florid osseous dysplasia.

Lipoblastoma is a benign soft tissue tumor that is composed of mature fat cells. It is typically found in children and young adults, and it most commonly occurs in the extremities. The tumor is usually slow-growing and non-aggressive, and it is often cured with surgery.

Liposarcoma, conventional myxoid variant is a malignant soft tissue tumor that is composed of fat cells and myxoid stroma. It is typically found in adults, and it most commonly occurs in the extremities. The tumor is usually slow-growing and non-aggressive, but it can be locally invasive and metastatic.

Liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant is a malignant soft tissue tumor that is composed of fat cells, myxoid stroma, and pleomorphic cells. It is typically found in adults, and it most commonly occurs in the extremities. The tumor is usually aggressive and metastatic.

Teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can contain any type of tissue, including skin, hair, teeth, and bone. It can be benign or malignant, and it can occur anywhere in the body. The most common site for a teratoma is the ovary in women and the testis in men.

In the case of the young boy in the question, the tumor was a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass extending into the orbital apex with smooth, nonaggressive bony remodeling and expansion of the left superior orbital fissure with further dorsal extension into the left cavernous sinus. This is consistent with a liposarcoma. The tumor was also negative for FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), which is a test that can be used to diagnose liposarcoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Lipoblastoma is a benign tumor that is typically found in children and young adults, and it does not have the same imaging findings as the patient's tumor. Liposarcoma, conventional myxoid variant is a malignant tumor that is typically found in adults, but it is usually slow-growing and non-aggressive. Teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can contain any type of tissue, but it is not typically found in the orbit.

The patient in this case has a history of pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign tumor of the skin. However, the current presentation is concerning for a more aggressive neoplasm, such as a squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis is a technique that can be used to identify specific proteins in cells, which can help to determine the type of neoplasm present. In this case, immunohistochemical analysis could be used to identify the presence of keratin, a protein that is found in squamous cell carcinoma cells. If keratin is present, it would suggest that the patient has a squamous cell carcinoma, which would require more aggressive treatment than a pyogenic granuloma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A, treat with cryotherapy, is incorrect because cryotherapy is a treatment that is typically used for benign tumors, such as pyogenic granuloma. Squamous cell carcinoma is a more aggressive neoplasm that requires more aggressive treatment.
* Choice C, perform tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms, is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest an infection. Tissue culture is typically used to diagnose infections.
* Choice D, provide reassurance, is incorrect because the patient's presentation is concerning for a more aggressive neoplasm. The patient should be referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.

 51%|█████     | 773/1525 [3:10:09<3:04:26, 14.72s/it]The correct answer is B. Replace heparin with argatroban for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious adverse effect of heparin therapy that can lead to life-threatening thrombosis. It is caused by an immune reaction to heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes. The diagnosis of HIT is based on a history of heparin exposure, a platelet count of <150,000/μL, and the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies.

The treatment of HIT is to stop heparin therapy and start an alternative anticoagulant. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that is effective in treating HIT. It is given as an intravenous infusion. Warfarin should not be started until the platelet count has recovered to >100,000/μL.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia. Continuing heparin therapy would increase the risk of thrombosis. Replacing piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem would not treat HIT. Transfusing platelets would not address the underlying cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia and could increase the risk of thrombosis.

A. Borderline lepromatous leprosy with trophic ulcer is incorrect because the patient has no evidence of leprosy. The leprosy diagnosis was considered previously in another health care facility, but there was no appreciable clinical improvement after 6 months of multidrug therapy. The patient also does not have any of the characteristic skin lesions of leprosy, such as nodules, plaques, or lepromatous infiltration.

B. Tropical phagedenic ulcer is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the characteristic features of this condition, such as a rapidly progressive ulcer with undermined edges. The patient's ulcer is well defined with regular margins and is not associated with fever, chills, or lymphadenopathy.

C. Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is the correct diagnosis because the patient has a history of kala-azar, which is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania donovani. PKDL is a chronic, relapsing skin disease that can develop months to years after kala-azar. The characteristic skin lesions of PKDL are hypopigmented macules or papules that may develop into ulcers. The lesions are often located on the face, scalp, and extremities. The patient in this case has multiple hypopigmented lesions on his face and scalp, as well as a nonhealing ulcer on his left foot. The histopathologic findings of PKDL are also consistent with the patient's presentation. The biopsy specimens from the ulcer and the hypopigmented facial lesion showed acute ulceration of the epidermis with granulation tissue and infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies were also present in the biopsy specimens, which are characteristic of PKDL.

D. Cutaneous diphtheria is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the characteristic features of this condition, such as a painful, erythematous ulcer with a pseudomembrane. The patient's ulcer is not painful and does not have a pseudomembrane. The patient also does not have any of the systemic features of cutaneous diphtheria, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, or myocarditis.

Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is a rare, idiopathic, non-inflammatory vasculopathy of the small vessels of the skin. It is characterized by the deposition of hyaline material around dilated and markedly thickened capillaries within the papillary dermis. The condition is most commonly seen in older women, and typically presents with asymptomatic, salmon-colored, monomorphic macules and fine telangiectasias localized to the lower extremities. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, which shows the characteristic perivascular hyaline deposits. There is no specific treatment for CCV, but the condition is usually self-limited and resolves spontaneously over time.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Essential telangiectasia is a common, benign condition characterized by the presence of small, dilated capillaries in the skin. It is not associated with any systemic symptoms or findings.
* Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is an inflammatory vasculitis of the small vessels of the skin and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of leukocytoclasis (fragmentation of neutrophils) in the vessel walls. The condition can be associated with a variety of systemic symptoms, including fever, arthralgia, and malaise.
* Pigmented purpuric dermatosis, Schamberg type is a chronic, relapsing, non-inflammatory vasculitis of the small vessels of the skin. It is characterized by the presence of small, purpuric macules on the lower extremities. The condition is most commonly seen in young adults, and is often associated with atopy.

A brown tumor is a localized area of bone resorption that occurs in patients with hyperparathyroidism. It is caused by the excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which leads to increased osteoclast activity and the release of calcium from bone. Brown tumors are typically found in the skull, mandible, ribs, and long bones. They are often asymptomatic, but can cause pain, swelling, and deformity. Brown tumors are diagnosed with imaging studies, such as X-ray or CT scan, and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying hyperparathyroidism, which can be done with surgery or medication.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not typically occur in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Giant cell tumor is a benign bone tumor that is more common in adults. Giant cell granuloma is a non-neoplastic condition that can occur in any age group. Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign bone tumor that is more common in children and young adults.

Here are some additional details about brown tumors:

* Brown tumors are typically found in the skull, mandible, ribs, and long bones.
* They are often asymptomatic, but can cause pain, swelling, and deformity.

 51%|█████     | 777/1525 [3:11:04<2:51:53, 13.79s/it]The correct answer is C. Monilethrix. Monilethrix is a rare, inherited hair shaft disorder characterized by short, brittle hair with beaded appearance. The hair loss is usually diffuse, but can be patchy. The condition is caused by a mutation in the KRT81 gene, which codes for a keratin protein that is essential for the structure of hair shafts.

Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp that can cause hair loss. However, the hair loss in tinea capitis is usually patchy, with areas of baldness surrounded by normal hair. In addition, tinea capitis is often associated with itching, redness, and scaling of the scalp.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and nails. Psoriasis of the scalp can cause hair loss, but the hair loss is usually patchy and associated with scaling and inflammation of the scalp.

Menkes disease is a rare, inherited disorder of copper metabolism that can cause hair loss. However, the hair loss in Menkes disease is usually diffuse and associated with other symptoms, such as seizures, developmental delay, and abnormal skin and nails.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of hair loss that began shortly after birth. The hair loss is diffuse and is not associated with itching, redness, or scaling of the scalp. The patient also has a family history of similar hair loss. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of monilethrix.

An intramural small bowel hematoma is a collection of blood within the wall of the small intestine. It is a rare condition, but it can occur as a result of blunt abdominal trauma, such as in the case of the patient in the question.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and a thickened bowel loop on abdominal ultrasonography are all consistent with an intramural small bowel hematoma. The CT scan findings of a thickened bowel wall with no free abdominal fluid also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Abdominal wall hematoma is a collection of blood within the abdominal wall. It is a common condition that can occur as a result of blunt abdominal trauma, but it is not likely in the case of this patient, who does not have any signs of abdominal wall tenderness or ecchymosis. Small-bowel perforation is a hole in the wall of the small intestine. It is a serious condition that can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and death. It is unlikely in the case of this patient, who does not have any signs of peritonitis, such as fever, abdominal pain, and guarding. Traumatic pancreatic injury is an injury to the pancreas. It is a rare condition that can occur as a result of blunt abdominal trauma, but it is not likely in the case of this patient, who does not have any signs of pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

 51%|█████     | 779/1525 [3:11:32<2:56:24, 14.19s/it]The correct answer is C. Heterotopic pregnancy with normal intrauterine gestation and ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix.

Acute appendicitis is a common condition that occurs when the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. The most common symptom of acute appendicitis is abdominal pain, which is usually located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Other symptoms may include fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Salpingitis is an infection of the fallopian tubes, which are the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Salpingitis is most commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. The most common symptom of salpingitis is abdominal pain, which is usually located in the lower abdomen. Other symptoms may include fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare condition in which a woman becomes pregnant with both an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and an ectopic pregnancy. An IUP is a pregnancy that occurs inside the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside of the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. The most common symptom of heterotopic pregnancy is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting.

Nonspecific abdominal pain is a common symptom of many different medical conditions. It is not a specific diagnosis, but rather a description of the pain. The cause of nonspecific abdominal pain can be difficult to determine, but it may be caused by conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, gastritis, or peptic ulcer disease.

The patient in the case presented with abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, which is a common symptom of both acute appendicitis and salpingitis. However, she also had a positive Blumberg sign, which is a sign of appendicitis. Additionally, the transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall. This finding is consistent with appendicitis.

The transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo. This finding rules out salpingitis, as salpingitis would not be expected to occur with a normal intrauterine pregnancy.

The patient was initially treated with amoxicillin clavulanate, which is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat appendicitis. However, her symptoms did not resolve, and she returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain. The Alvarado score was 5, which is a score that is used to diagnose appendicitis. A score of 7 or greater is considered to be highly suggestive of appendicitis.

The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics. In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve, although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic. The surgeon on call requested an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation. The MRI showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa (RIF) and what appeared to be an inflamed, thickened appendix (9.83 mm in the proximal appendix). This finding is consistent with heterotopic pregnancy with ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix.

Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare condition, but it is important to consider this diagnosis in women who present with abdominal pain in early pregnancy. The diagnosis can be made with imaging studies, such as an MRI or ultrasound. Treatment for heterotopic pregnancy typically involves surgery to remove the ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The intrauterine pregnancy may be allowed to continue to term, or it may be terminated depending on the patient's wishes.

 51%|█████     | 780/1525 [3:11:49<3:05:08, 14.91s/it]The correct answer is D. Observe.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. She presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes but no blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia. She was recently discharged from the hospital for West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis.

The most likely cause of the patient's floaters is vitreous floaters. Vitreous floaters are small, dark spots or cobweb-like threads that appear to float in your field of vision. They are caused by clumps of protein or cells that become suspended in the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina at the back of the eye.

Vitreous floaters are a common problem, especially in people over the age of 40. They are usually harmless and do not require treatment. However, if they are severe or bothersome, they can be treated with laser surgery or vitrectomy.

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy increases her risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina. The damage can cause the blood vessels to leak fluid or blood into the retina, or it can cause the blood vessels to close down.

The patient's recent discharge from the hospital for WNV encephalitis is also a concern. WNV encephalitis is a viral infection of the brain that can cause serious complications, including meningitis, encephalitis, and death.

In the absence of other symptoms, such as blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia, the most likely cause of the patient's floaters is vitreous floaters. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy increases her risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, but there is no evidence that she has diabetic retinopathy at this time. The patient's recent discharge from the hospital for WNV encephalitis is also a concern, but there is no evidence that the WNV encephalitis has caused any damage to the patient's eyes.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to observe the patient and monitor her floaters for any changes. If the floaters become severe or bothersome, or if the patient develops any other symptoms, such as blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia, then further testing and treatment may be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

* Option A, order vitreous biopsy, is not appropriate because there is no evidence that the patient has a serious eye condition that would require a biopsy.
* Option B, order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, is not appropriate because there is no evidence that the patient has a brain condition that would require an MRI.
* Option C, order biopsy of chorioretinal lesion, is not appropriate because there is no evidence that the patient has a chorioretinal lesion that would require a biopsy.

 51%|█████     | 781/1525 [3:12:02<2:58:12, 14.37s/it]The correct answer is C. Order magnetic resonance imaging for the orbits and brain.

The patient has a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and stem cell transplant. She presents with blurry vision in the left eye, a new-onset right facial palsy, and bilateral eyelid, lip, and feet swelling. Ophthalmologic evaluation reveals visual acuities of 20/20 OD and 20/800 OS, a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye, and decreased color vision in the left eye. Extraocular movements, confrontation visual fields, and intraocular pressures are within normal limits. Anterior segment examination is unremarkable in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination reveals optic nerve head edema and peripapillary hemorrhages bilaterally, greater in the left eye than in the right eye. Scattered peripheral hemorrhages are present, consistent with thrombocytopenia at the time.

The most likely diagnosis is optic nerve infiltration by lymphoma. This is supported by the patient's history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, the presence of optic nerve head edema and peripapillary hemorrhages on fundus examination, and the absence of other causes of optic nerve dysfunction, such as optic neuritis or intracranial hypertension.

The next step in management is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and brain. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of optic nerve infiltration by lymphoma and to assess the extent of disease. If the MRI shows evidence of lymphomatous involvement of the brain, then the patient will need to be treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Observe: This is not an appropriate management option for a patient with suspected optic nerve infiltration by lymphoma. The patient needs to be evaluated and treated as soon as possible to prevent further loss of vision.

B. Perform a lumbar puncture: This is not an appropriate management option for a patient with suspected optic nerve infiltration by lymphoma. A lumbar puncture would not provide any useful information in this case.

D. Perform optic nerve decompression: This is not an appropriate management option for a patient with suspected optic nerve infiltration by lymphoma. Optic nerve decompression is a surgical procedure that is used to treat optic nerve compression from tumors or other lesions. In this case, the patient does not have optic nerve compression, so optic nerve decompression would not be helpful.

The patient in this case has a peripapillary defect in the right eye. This is a common finding in patients with high myopia, and it is usually benign. However, in some cases, it can lead to serous macular detachment, which is a serious condition that can cause vision loss.

The best way to monitor for serous macular detachment is with visual field testing. This test can detect changes in vision that may be caused by a detachment. If a detachment is detected, it can be treated with laser therapy or surgery.

Ordering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is not necessary in this case. The patient has no symptoms of neurological problems, and the OCT findings are consistent with a peripapillary defect. An MRI would not provide any additional information.

Immediately demarcating the region with indirect argon laser barricade is also not necessary. This procedure is used to treat retinal detachments, but it is not effective in treating peripapillary defects.

Ordering indocyanine green angiography and photodynamic therapy is also not necessary. These procedures are used to treat choroidal neovascularization, which is a condition that can cause vision loss. However, the OCT findings in this case do not suggest that the patient has choroidal neovascularization.

Therefore, the best course of action is to order visual field testing and observe the patient closely for serous macular detachment. If a detachment is detected, it can be treated with laser therapy or surgery.

 51%|█████▏    | 783/1525 [3:12:28<2:50:41, 13.80s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start a high dose of systemic steroids.

The patient has a history of bilateral ocular trauma from a remote gunpowder explosion with resulting bilateral cicatricial lagophthalmos, corneal and conjunctival scarring, and secondary open-angle glaucoma. He underwent transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) for his glaucoma. TSCPC is a procedure that uses heat to destroy the ciliary body, which is responsible for producing aqueous humor. Aqueous humor is the fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye. When the ciliary body is destroyed, aqueous humor production decreases, which helps to lower intraocular pressure.

Two weeks after TSCPC, the patient developed pain and redness. Examination revealed episcleritis and a small scleral depression temporally. Episcleritis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin, transparent tissue that covers the white of the eye. Scleritis is an inflammation of the sclera, which is the white of the eye.

The patient was started on topical prednisolone therapy, but his pain intensified. Examination on postoperative day 37 revealed stable visual acuity of count fingers, intraocular pressure of 19 mm Hg, no hypopyon, but a diffusely injected conjunctiva with a creamy fluctuant elevated lesion temporally. Hypopyon is a collection of white blood cells in the anterior chamber of the eye.

The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the interior of the eye. Endophthalmitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is a serious condition that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly.

The first step in treating endophthalmitis is to identify the causative organism. This is done by obtaining cultures from the eye. Once the organism is identified, the appropriate antibiotic can be started. In addition to antibiotics, systemic steroids are also used to treat endophthalmitis. Steroids help to reduce inflammation and swelling.

In the patient's case, the most likely cause of endophthalmitis is bacteria. This is because he has a history of ocular trauma, which increases the risk of infection. The patient should be started on intravenous antibiotics as soon as possible. In addition, he should be started on a high dose of systemic steroids.

The patient should also be taken to the operating room for exploratory surgery. This is done to drain any pus that may be present in the eye. The surgeon may also need to remove any infected tissue.

Endophthalmitis is a serious condition, but it is treatable with prompt diagnosis and treatment. The patient's prognosis depends on the severity of the infection and the organism that is causing it. With early diagnosis and treatment, most patients with endophthalmitis will have a good outcome and retain their vision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Obtain cultures at the slitlamp. This is not the first step in treating endophthalmitis. The first step is to start intravenous antibiotics.
* B. Perform a vitreous tap and inject antibiotics. This is a procedure that can be used to obtain cultures from the eye. However, it is not necessary in the patient's case because he is already being treated with intravenous antibiotics.
* C. Perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start intravenous antibiotics. This is the correct answer. However, it is important to note that the patient should also be started on a high dose of systemic steroids.

 51%|█████▏    | 784/1525 [3:12:43<2:56:45, 14.31s/it]The correct answer is C. Inflammatory reaction.

The patient has a history of recurrent oral cancer, with the most recent recurrence occurring 16 years ago. She has also had a total thyroidectomy, complicated by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. This means that she has a history of both head and neck cancer and radiation therapy to the neck.

The PET scan shows focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 localization within the known oral cavity SCC and in a small, level IIA lymph node, located lateral to the upper right internal jugular vein. There is also unexpected, prominent, metabolic activity in the medial and asymmetrically enlarged left vocal cord.

The most likely explanation for the increased metabolic activity in the left vocal cord is an inflammatory reaction. This is supported by the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and radiation therapy to the neck. Radiation therapy can damage the nerves and blood vessels in the neck, leading to inflammation and swelling. This inflammation can cause the vocal cords to become thickened and immobile.

The other possible explanations for the increased metabolic activity in the left vocal cord are metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, primary laryngeal carcinoma, and postradiation change. However, these are less likely given the patient's history and the findings on the PET scan.

Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the vocal cords. This is unlikely in this case because the patient has no other evidence of metastatic disease.

Primary laryngeal carcinoma is a cancer that starts in the vocal cords. This is also unlikely in this case because the patient has a history of recurrent oral cancer. It is more likely that the cancer in the vocal cords is a metastasis from the oral cancer.

Postradiation change is a change that can occur in the tissues after radiation therapy. This change can cause inflammation and swelling, which can lead to the vocal cords becoming thickened and immobile. However, the postradiation change is usually seen in the area that was directly treated with radiation therapy. In this case, the increased metabolic activity is seen in the left vocal cord, which was not directly treated with radiation therapy.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the increased metabolic activity in the left vocal cord is an inflammatory reaction. This is supported by the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and radiation therapy to the neck.

Myopericytoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor that most commonly arises in the soft tissues of the extremities, but can also occur in the head and neck region. It is a well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated lesion that is composed of bland, round, syncytial cells arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized slit-like vascular spaces. The cells are positive for smooth-muscle actin (SMA), muscle-specific actin (MSA), and CD34, but negative for B-catenin and epithelial membrane antigen.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Glomus tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the glomus bodies, which are small, specialized neurovascular structures that are found in the skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues. Glomus tumors are typically small, well-circumscribed lesions that are composed of glomus cells, which are small, round cells with abundant cytoplasm and a centrally located nucleus. Glomus tumors are positive for S-100 protein and HMB-45, but negative for SMA, MSA, and CD34.
* Myofibroma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the myofibroblasts, which are cells that have features of both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Myofibromas are typically small, well-circumscribed lesions that are composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in a storiform or fascicular pattern. Myofibromas are positive for SMA and MSA, but negative for CD34.
* Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the mesenchymal cells of the soft tissues. Solitary fibrous tumors are typically large, lobulated lesions that are composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in a storiform or fascicular pattern. Solitary fibrous tumors are positive for CD34 and bcl-2, but negative for SMA and MSA.

The patient is a man in his 60s who presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia, a 3-month history of a 2.268-kg weight loss, and a right neck mass. Tobacco history was minimal and distant, and alcohol use was social only. Physical examination, including flexible nasolaryngoscopy, was notable for a large smooth nonulcerated right base of tongue mass with almost complete pharyngeal airway obstruction, and a 4-cm right level II lymph node. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a 3-cm base of tongue–lingual tonsil mass with multiple right Ib, IIa, and II/III nodes, the largest of which was 2.0 cm by 3.0 cm. Awake tracheotomy and direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of right base of tongue mass lesion was performed.

Histological analysis showed sheets and clusters of small round-oval uniform cells with minimal cytoplasm, granular chromatin pattern, and prominent nuclear molding (Figure, A) with positive immunoreactivity for cytokeratin (CK) 7 (Figure, B) and synaptophysin (Figure, C); a high mitotic rate was also exhibited (Figure, D). The cells were negative for CK 5 and 6, CK 20, NUT, p63, and chromogranin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA and did not detect HPV 6, 11, and 18 DNA.

The histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of small-cell carcinoma. Small-cell carcinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the lung, the thymus, the gastrointestinal tract, and the genitourinary tract. It is a highly aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that typically occurs in the skin of the sun-exposed areas. It is not associated with human papillomavirus (HPV).
* Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer. It is typically seen in older adults with a history of tobacco use. It is not associated with human papillomavirus (HPV).
* Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a rare childhood cancer that can occur in the brain, spinal cord, or other parts of the body. It is not associated with human papillomavirus (HPV).

 52%|█████▏    | 788/1525 [3:13:33<2:48:50, 13.75s/it]The correct diagnosis is intradiploic meningoencephalocele. This is a rare congenital condition in which there is a herniation of the meninges and brain through a defect in the skull. The most common presentation is with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak from the nose. Other symptoms may include headache, facial pain, and hearing loss. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment typically involves surgery to repair the defect and prevent further CSF leakage.

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. It is a rare condition, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers. Multiple myeloma can cause a variety of symptoms, including bone pain, fatigue, anemia, and kidney problems. The diagnosis is made with blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and imaging studies. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Paget disease is a chronic condition that causes the bones to become enlarged and weakened. It is a relatively common condition, affecting about 3% of people over the age of 50. Paget disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including bone pain, fractures, and hearing loss. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment typically involves medications to reduce the activity of the disease and to prevent complications.

Fibrous dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormal growth of the bones. It can affect any bone in the body, but it is most common in the legs, pelvis, and skull. Fibrous dysplasia can cause a variety of symptoms, including bone pain, fractures, and deformity. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment typically involves surgery to correct the deformity or to relieve pain.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is intradiploic meningoencephalocele. This is because the patient has a history of CSF rhinorrhea, which is a classic symptom of this condition. The patient also has a lytic lesion of the occipital bone, which is a finding that is often seen on imaging studies in patients with intradiploic meningoencephalocele. Multiple myeloma, Paget disease, and fibrous dysplasia are all possible diagnoses, but they are less likely in this case.

 52%|█████▏    | 789/1525 [3:13:50<2:58:31, 14.55s/it]The correct answer is C. Inquire about history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding.

The patient has a history of congenital horizontal nystagmus, which is a condition that causes involuntary eye movements. She also has platinum white hair, which is a rare condition that is associated with a number of genetic syndromes. In addition, she has a history of cutaneous melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer.

All of these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by nystagmus, albinism, and a predisposition to bleeding disorders. The most common bleeding disorder associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is von Willebrand disease, which is a condition that affects the blood's ability to clot.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to inquire about her history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding. If she has a history of these problems, then it is likely that she has von Willebrand disease. Further testing, such as a von Willebrand factor level, can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not as likely to be helpful in the evaluation of this patient. A dilated ophthalmic examination may be useful in evaluating the patient's nystagmus, but it is unlikely to provide any information about her bleeding disorder. Molecular genetic testing may be useful in diagnosing Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, but it is not necessary in the initial evaluation of this patient. Counsel to avoid sun exposure is important for all patients with albinism, but it is not specific to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.

In conclusion, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to inquire about her history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding. If she has a history of these problems, then it is likely that she has von Willebrand disease. Further testing, such as a von Willebrand factor level, can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

 52%|█████▏    | 790/1525 [3:14:01<2:48:01, 13.72s/it]The correct answer is B: Biopsy the lesion.

A is incorrect because incision and drainage is not the appropriate treatment for a subcutaneous nodule. Incision and drainage is typically used to treat abscesses, which are collections of pus that form when bacteria infect tissue. The lesion in this case is not an abscess, and there is no evidence of infection. Incision and drainage could actually worsen the lesion by introducing bacteria into the tissue.

C is incorrect because prescribing an anti-inflammatory agent is not the appropriate treatment for a subcutaneous nodule. Anti-inflammatory agents are used to treat inflammation, which is the body's response to injury or infection. The lesion in this case does not appear to be inflamed, and there is no evidence of infection. Prescribing an anti-inflammatory agent would not be effective and could actually mask the symptoms of a more serious condition.

D is incorrect because performing a touch preparation is not the appropriate treatment for a subcutaneous nodule. A touch preparation is a quick and easy way to diagnose a skin infection, but it is not accurate for diagnosing other conditions. The lesion in this case could be caused by a number of different conditions, including cancer, so a touch preparation would not be helpful.

The most appropriate next step is to biopsy the lesion. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the body and examined under a microscope. This can help to diagnose the cause of the lesion and determine the best course of treatment.

Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a rare skin condition that is characterized by a perivascular and periadnexal granulomatous infiltrate. It is usually associated with systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Granuloma annulare is a common skin condition that typically presents with small, annular, erythematous papules. It is usually a self-limited disease, and treatment is not always necessary.

Leukemia cutis is a rare skin manifestation of leukemia. It typically presents with multiple, annular, indurated, dusky red plaques with central clearing and trailing scale. It is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment.

The patient in the case presentation has multiple, annular, indurated, dusky red plaques with central clearing and trailing scale. He also has a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which is a condition that is associated with an increased risk of leukemia. The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen shows a perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia cutis.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. It is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous (red), scaly plaques, and discoid lesions. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is most common in women of childbearing age. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical skin lesions of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis is a condition that occurs when there is a blockage of small blood vessels in the skin due to an increase in the number of platelets in the blood. This can cause a variety of skin lesions, including purpura, livedo reticularis, and digital ulcers. The patient in the case does not have any of the typical skin lesions of cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis.

Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption is a condition that can occur in patients who are taking hydroxyurea, a medication used to treat cancer and other conditions. It is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous (red), scaly plaques, and poikiloderma.

Sneddon syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by livedo reticularis (a net-like pattern of skin discoloration) and cerebrovascular disease. It is most commonly seen in women in their 40s and 50s. The exact cause of Sneddon syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The skin lesions in Sneddon syndrome are typically asymptomatic, but they can sometimes be itchy or painful. The cerebrovascular disease associated with Sneddon syndrome can range from transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) to stroke. TIAs are temporary episodes of brain ischemia that cause symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or difficulty speaking. Strokes are permanent episodes of brain ischemia that can cause a variety of neurological problems, including paralysis, speech impairment, and cognitive difficulties.

There is no cure for Sneddon syndrome, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment typically includes medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating a healthy diet.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (van Lohuizen syndrome) is a rare disorder characterized by marbled skin and telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels) at birth. It is not associated with cerebrovascular disease.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. SLE is not typically associated with livedo reticularis.
* Ataxia-telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by ataxia (loss of coordination), telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels), and immunodeficiency. Ataxia-telangiectasia is not typically associated with livedo reticularis.

* Recurrent episodes of neurological symptoms, including dysarthria, ataxia, and cranial nerve palsies
* Brain MRI findings of T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes with associated patchy enhancement
* CSF findings of a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and negative viral polymerase chain reaction studies
* Response to treatment with corticosteroids

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is characterized by recurrent episodes of neurological symptoms. However, MS typically presents with a more chronic course than the patient's presentation, and MS lesions are typically not associated with enhancement on brain MRI.

Central nervous system lymphoma (CNS lymphoma) is a malignant tumor of the CNS. CNS lymphoma typically presents with focal neurological deficits, and brain MRI findings may include contrast-enhancing lesions. However, the patient's brain MRI findings are not consistent with CNS lymphoma.

Neurosarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ system, including the CNS. Neurosarcoidosis can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and cognitive impairment. However, brain MRI findings in neurosarcoidosis are typically non-specific, and the patient's brain MRI findings are not consistent with neurosarcoidosis.

A congenital nevus is a birthmark that is present at birth. It is a type of mole that can be flat or raised, and it can be any color. Congenital nevi are usually not harmful, but they can sometimes become cancerous.

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. Melanoma can be deadly, but it is usually treatable if it is caught early.

Angiokeratoma is a skin condition that causes small, red or purple spots on the skin. Angiokeratomas are caused by abnormal growths of blood vessels in the skin. They are usually harmless, but they can sometimes be a sign of a more serious medical condition.

Mastocytoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the mast cells, the cells that release chemicals that cause allergic reactions. Mastocytomas are usually not harmful, but they can sometimes be a sign of a more serious medical condition.

In the case of the 16-year-old boy, the lesion was a cluster of 1-mm flat purple-black papules coalescing into a 1.5 × 1.0-cm oval plaque with surrounding erythema. This is consistent with the appearance of angiokeratoma. The lesion also changed significantly over time, becoming skin-colored to pink thin-walled vesicles clustered within a 1.5 × 1.0-cm oval telangiectatic plaque. This is also consistent with the appearance of angiokeratoma.

Congenital nevi, melanoma, and mastocytomas do not typically present with the sudden appearance of new lesions. They also do not typically change in appearance over time. Therefore, angiokeratoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

The patient is a 40-year-old man with a 3-month history of a right breast mass slowly enlarging with associated pain. The mass is hard, irregular, mobile, and tethered to the overlying skin but not fixed to the underlying muscle. There are palpable lymph nodes in the ipsilateral axilla. The left breast and axilla are normal. The right mediolateral oblique mammography shows a breast mass and axillary lymph nodes. The computed tomography scan of the chest shows the right breast mass involving the skin but not the pectoralis muscle. These findings are consistent with carcinoma.

Gynecomastia is a benign condition in which the breasts enlarge in men. It is caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia is usually not painful and does not require treatment.

Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells. It is usually soft and movable, and it does not cause pain. Lipomas are common in adults and are often found on the trunk, arms, and legs.

Epidermal inclusion cyst is a small, fluid-filled sac that forms in the skin. It is caused by an obstruction of a hair follicle. Epidermal inclusion cysts are usually not painful and do not require treatment.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is carcinoma. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are all consistent with this diagnosis. Gynecomastia, lipoma, and epidermal inclusion cyst are all benign conditions that are less likely to cause the symptoms and findings that the patient presents with.

 52%|█████▏    | 797/1525 [3:15:38<2:55:39, 14.48s/it]The correct diagnosis is mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). MVT is a rare but serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the veins that drain blood from the small intestine. This can cause ischemia (lack of blood flow) to the small intestine, which can lead to necrosis (death of tissue) and perforation of the bowel.

The patient in this case presents with several features that are consistent with MVT, including:

* Diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis: These symptoms are consistent with ischemia of the small intestine.
* Mild tachycardia but normotensive and afebrile: This is a non-specific finding, but it is consistent with MVT.
* Distended abdomen, diffuse rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding: These findings are consistent with peritonitis, which can occur as a complication of MVT.
* Elevated lactate concentration: This is a non-specific finding, but it is often seen in patients with MVT.
* Elevated white blood cell count: This is a non-specific finding, but it is often seen in patients with MVT.
* Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast revealing diffuse free fluid but without free air and several loops of dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls: This finding is highly suggestive of MVT.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the bowel. However, IBD is not typically associated with diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis. Small-bowel neoplasm is a rare tumor that can occur in the small intestine. However, small-bowel neoplasm is not typically associated with diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis. Superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism (SMAE) is a rare condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the superior mesenteric artery. SMAE is typically associated with sudden, severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis in this case is MVT. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with MVT. The CT scan findings are also highly suggestive of MVT. The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case.

 52%|█████▏    | 798/1525 [3:15:55<3:02:31, 15.06s/it]The correct answer is D. Conduct endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization.

The patient has acute dacryocystitis with overlying preseptal cellulitis. She was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics, but her symptoms did not improve. On day 2 of admission, ophthalmology was consulted and a bedside beveled percutaneous needle drainage was performed. The lacrimal sac was decompressed and 3 mL of purulent discharge was aspirated. By day 3 of admission, the edema and preseptal cellulitis had improved.

However, the patient's symptoms are likely to recur if the underlying obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct is not treated. Endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization is the most effective treatment for nasolacrimal duct obstruction. It involves using an endoscope to visualize the nasolacrimal duct and then creating a small opening in the duct to allow the tears to drain into the nose.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Transition to oral antibiotics and discharge is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are likely to recur. Probe with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system is not appropriate because it is not a definitive treatment for nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Perform lacrimal sac digital massage is not appropriate because it is not a definitive treatment for nasolacrimal duct obstruction and it can cause further inflammation and infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Conduct endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization.

 52%|█████▏    | 799/1525 [3:16:05<2:45:58, 13.72s/it]The correct answer is D. Measure the patient’s blood pressure. The patient's history and physical examination suggest that she may have an underlying autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis or lupus. These diseases can cause optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can lead to vision loss, and it is important to diagnose and treat the underlying disease as soon as possible.

A lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. Prescribing corticosteroids or azithromycin would not be appropriate without a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease.

Measuring the patient's blood pressure is important because high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the brain, leading to stroke. If the patient's blood pressure is high, it will need to be treated to prevent further damage to the brain.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

A. Order a lumbar puncture: A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid. This procedure is used to diagnose meningitis, encephalitis, and other infections of the central nervous system. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis, so a lumbar puncture is not necessary.

B. Prescribe corticosteroids and consult rheumatology: Corticosteroids are a type of medication that can be used to treat inflammation. They can be effective in treating optic neuritis, but they are not always necessary. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that she has an autoimmune disease, so it is not necessary to prescribe corticosteroids or consult a rheumatologist.

C. Prescribe azithromycin: Azithromycin is an antibiotic that can be used to treat infections caused by bacteria. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of infection, so there is no reason to prescribe azithromycin.

D. Measure the patient’s blood pressure: Measuring the patient's blood pressure is important because high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the brain, leading to stroke. If the patient's blood pressure is high, it will need to be treated to prevent further damage to the brain.

 52%|█████▏    | 800/1525 [3:16:21<2:51:14, 14.17s/it]The correct answer is C: Order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture.

The patient's history and presentation are concerning for a demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, numbness, tingling, weakness, and problems with coordination and balance.

The patient's blurry vision, optic nerve pallor, and lack of leakage on fluorescein angiography are all consistent with MS. In addition, her history of optic neuritis is a risk factor for MS.

To confirm the diagnosis of MS, the patient should undergo brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture. Brain neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can show areas of demyelination in the brain. Lumbar puncture can be used to measure the levels of certain proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can be elevated in MS.

If the patient is diagnosed with MS, she will need to be treated with medications to suppress the immune system and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment options include disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and corticosteroids. DMTs are medications that are taken on a long-term basis to reduce the frequency and severity of MS attacks. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medications that can be used to treat acute MS attacks.

The patient should also be referred to a neurologist for ongoing management of her condition. The neurologist will monitor her for signs of disease progression and adjust her treatment as needed.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Asking the patient to taper the oral prednisone and reassure her that the symptoms will gradually resolve is not appropriate in this case. The patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious condition, and she needs to be evaluated by a doctor.
* Option B: Administering intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent is not appropriate in this case. This treatment is used to treat retinal diseases that are caused by abnormal blood vessel growth, such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. The patient's symptoms are not caused by abnormal blood vessel growth, and this treatment would not be beneficial.
* Option D: Ordering an infectious and inflammatory workup is not appropriate in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infectious or inflammatory condition. An infectious and inflammatory workup would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating her condition.

The patient in the case presented with acute bilateral eyelid edema, erythema, and ulceration. These findings are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a serious adverse drug reaction that can occur in response to a variety of medications, including cephalexin. SJS is characterized by a rash that begins as a macular erythematous eruption that rapidly progresses to bullous lesions. The lesions can involve the skin, mucous membranes, and eyes. In severe cases, SJS can lead to scarring, blindness, and death.

The initial treatment of SJS is to stop the offending medication and provide supportive care. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation. However, corticosteroids can increase the risk of infection, so they are typically only used in patients with severe disease.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a treatment that has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of SJS. IVIg is a preparation of antibodies that is derived from pooled human plasma. It is thought to work by suppressing the immune system and preventing the body from attacking its own tissues.

In the case presented, the patient had a rash that involved her skin, mucous membranes, and eyes. She also had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an elevated level of C-reactive protein, which are markers of inflammation. These findings, along with the patient's history of taking cephalexin, are consistent with a diagnosis of SJS.

The correct management for this patient would be to stop the cephalexin and administer IVIg. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of complications, such as infection and scarring.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Start corticosteroid eyedrops and check daily for pseudomembrane formation. Corticosteroid eyedrops may be used to treat the eye inflammation associated with SJS, but they are not a first-line treatment for the condition.
* C. Perform Tzanck smear on swab from ulcerated lesion. A Tzanck smear is a test that can be used to diagnose herpes simplex virus infection. However, the patient's rash is not consistent with herpes simplex virus infection, so a Tzanck smear is not necessary.
* D. Institute contact precautions and prescribe mupirocin ointment to eyelid skin. Contact precautions should be instituted for any patient with a contagious disease, such as SJS. However, mupirocin ointment is not a first-line treatment for SJS.

A spontaneous perinephric hematoma is a collection of blood that forms between the kidney and the abdominal wall. It is most commonly caused by trauma, but it can also be caused by anticoagulants, blood thinners, or certain medications. The patient in the case presented with acute, severe, left flank pain, which is a common symptom of a spontaneous perinephric hematoma. She was also found to have acute-onset thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which can increase the risk of bleeding. The CT scan showed a large, crescent-shaped collection of blood in the left perinephric space, which is consistent with a spontaneous perinephric hematoma.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is a rupture of the main artery in the abdomen. It is a life-threatening condition that typically presents with severe abdominal pain, back pain, and hypotension. The patient in the case did not have any of these symptoms.
* Splenic rupture is a rupture of the spleen. It is a serious condition that can lead to life-threatening bleeding. The patient in the case did not have any of the classic symptoms of splenic rupture, such as left upper quadrant pain, shoulder pain, and fever.
* Pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidney. It is a common condition that typically presents with fever, flank pain, and urinary symptoms. The patient in the case did not have any of the classic symptoms of pyelonephritis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is B. Spontaneous perinephric hematoma.

 53%|█████▎    | 803/1525 [3:17:04<2:53:46, 14.44s/it]The correct answer is C. Treat with full-dose anticoagulation.

The patient has multiple systemic emboli, which are likely due to cancer emboli from the metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The mitral valve masses are mobile and likely to embolize, so anticoagulation is the best way to prevent further emboli.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of infection. Surgical valve replacement is not indicated in this case, as the patient is not hemodynamically unstable and the mitral valve masses are not causing significant mitral regurgitation. Chemotherapy (erlotinib) is not indicated in this case, as it is not effective against metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* **A. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics** is incorrect because there is no evidence of infection. The patient has multiple systemic emboli, which are likely due to cancer emboli from the metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Cancer emboli are not caused by infection, so antibiotics are not indicated.

* **B. Refer for surgical valve replacement** is incorrect because the patient is not hemodynamically unstable and the mitral valve masses are not causing significant mitral regurgitation. Surgical valve replacement is a major surgery with significant risks, so it is only indicated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have significant mitral regurgitation.

* **D. Initiate chemotherapy (erlotinib)** is incorrect because it is not effective against metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Erlotinib is a targeted therapy that is effective against some types of lung cancer, but it is not effective against metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.

The patient is a woman in her 30s who presented with a 7-month history of right-sided nasal obstruction. She had been treated with several courses of oral antibiotics and intranasal steroids without improvement of symptoms. She had no history of sinus infections or allergic rhinitis. Nasal obstruction was constant and associated with right paranasal pressure. Results from a head and neck examination, including cranial nerve, were normal, except for the results from nasal endoscopy, which showed a deviated septum and a soft-tissue mass emanating from the right middle meatus inferior to the middle turbinate that seemed to have a polypoid appearance superiorly and a papillomatous appearance inferiorly. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the sinuses without contrast showed complete opacification of the right paranasal sinuses with mass effect on the medial maxillary wall with mild hyperostosis posterolaterally. The patient underwent an endoscopic right sinonasal mass biopsy. Intraoperatively, further excision of the mass was aborted owing to an unusual appearance of the mass as well as clear fluid exuding from the mass during microdebridement. Pathologic analysis of the biopsied tissue revealed a uniform spindle cell tumor comprised of cellular fascicles and tumor cells with bland nuclei (Figure, A and B). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the face with contrast was obtained postoperatively to further delineate the mass and evaluate for intracranial extension. Initial histologic stains showed the tumor to be positive for S-100 and actin (Figure, C and D) and negative for GFAP, CD34, and cytokeratin. Additional immunostains showed the tumor to be negative for SOX-10 and B-catenin.

The differential diagnosis for a sinonasal mass includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign neoplasms are inflammatory polyps, papillomas, and osteomas. The most common malignant neoplasms are sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that accounts for less than 1% of all sarcomas. It is characterized by the presence of both epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The epithelial component is typically of a squamous or glandular type, while the mesenchymal component is typically of a rhabdomyosarcomatous or chondrosarcomatous type. The tumor is typically diagnosed in adults in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. The tumor is typically locally advanced at presentation and has a poor prognosis. The treatment of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient in the case presented with a history of right-sided nasal obstruction that had been unresponsive to medical therapy. She had a deviated septum and a soft-tissue mass emanating from the right middle meatus. The CT scan showed complete opacification of the right paranasal sinuses with mass effect on the medial maxillary wall. The biopsy revealed a uniform spindle cell tumor comprised of cellular fascicles and tumor cells with bland nuclei. The immunohistochemical stains showed the tumor to be positive for S-100 and actin and negative for GFAP, CD34, and cytokeratin. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

The other choices in the differential diagnosis are less likely in this case. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm that typically occurs in adults in the fourth or fifth decade of life. It is most commonly found in the pleura, but can also occur in the soft tissues, including the sinonasal cavity. The tumor is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. The diagnosis is made on the basis of imaging studies and biopsy. The treatment is surgical resection.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a rare, malignant neoplasm that typically occurs in adults in the fifth or sixth decade of life. It most commonly arises from the peripheral nerves of the extremities, but can also occur in the head and neck. The tumor is typically locally advanced at presentation and has a poor prognosis. The treatment is surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Synovial sarcoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that typically occurs in adolescents and young adults. It most commonly arises in the extremities, but can also occur in the head and neck. The tumor is typically locally advanced at presentation and has a poor prognosis. The treatment is surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. The other choices in the differential diagnosis are less likely in this case.

Infectious pseudotumor is a rare, benign inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the body, but is most commonly seen in the head and neck. It is characterized by a rapidly growing mass that is often mistaken for a neoplasm. The mass is typically composed of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, and may also contain granulomas. The cause of infectious pseudotumor is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated response to an infection. The most common organisms associated with infectious pseudotumor are viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, and bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus.

The diagnosis of infectious pseudotumor is made based on clinical findings, imaging studies, and histopathologic examination. The mass is typically non-tender and non-fluctuant, and may be associated with fever, malaise, and weight loss. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, may show a well-defined mass with surrounding edema. Histopathologic examination shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with granulomas.

The treatment of infectious pseudotumor is typically surgical excision. The mass is usually completely removed, and there is a good prognosis for complete recovery. In some cases, steroids may be used to reduce inflammation.

The other options are incorrect because they are all malignant neoplasms. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is most commonly seen in adults. Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is a rare, inflammatory condition that affects lymph nodes. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect any organ system, including the head and neck.

A subglottic cyst is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the subglottis, the area just below the vocal cords. It is a rare condition that most commonly affects infants and young children. The exact cause of subglottic cysts is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by an obstruction of the subglottic glands. This obstruction can be caused by inflammation, infection, or trauma.

Subglottic cysts can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

* Stridor, a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing
* Cough
* Retractions, inward pulling of the chest wall during breathing
* Feeding difficulty
* Cyanosis, bluish discoloration of the skin

In some cases, subglottic cysts may resolve on their own without treatment. However, if symptoms are severe or do not improve with time, surgery may be necessary to remove the cyst.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Laryngotracheitis (croup) is an inflammation of the larynx and trachea. It is a common childhood illness that is usually caused by a viral infection. Croup is characterized by a barking cough, stridor, and hoarseness. The symptoms of croup usually resolve on their own within a few days.
* C. Subglottic stenosis is a narrowing of the subglottis. It is a rare condition that can be caused by a number of factors, including inflammation, infection, trauma, and surgery. Subglottic stenosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including stridor, cough, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for subglottic stenosis may include surgery, balloon dilation, or stent placement.
* D. Subglottic hemangioma is a rare type of hemangioma that occurs in the subglottis. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that are made up of blood vessels. Subglottic hemangiomas can cause a variety of symptoms, including stridor, cough, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for subglottic hemangiomas may include surgery, laser therapy, or steroid injections.

Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare, benign, chronic inflammatory condition of the skin characterized by the accumulation of macrophages containing Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. It is most commonly seen in the elderly, especially in those with chronic renal failure. The most common presentation is as a solitary or multiple papules or nodules on the skin, particularly in the groin, perineum, and perianal area. The lesions may be red, brown, or black and may be tender or painful.

The diagnosis of cutaneous malakoplakia is made by biopsy. The characteristic histologic finding is the presence of macrophages containing Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. These bodies are composed of calcium phosphate and iron and are thought to be formed by the breakdown of bacteria.

There is no specific treatment for cutaneous malakoplakia. Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying condition, such as renal failure. Topical steroids or antibiotics may be used to treat the skin lesions.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Deep fungal infection: The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a deep fungal infection. Deep fungal infections are rare in the elderly and are more common in immunocompromised patients. The patient does not have any risk factors for a deep fungal infection, such as diabetes, HIV, or cancer.
* Granular cell tumor: Granular cell tumors are rare, benign tumors that can occur anywhere in the body, including the skin. They are most common in the head and neck region. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a granular cell tumor. Granular cell tumors are usually painless and do not cause any symptoms.
* Metastatic prostate cancer: Metastatic prostate cancer is the spread of prostate cancer to other parts of the body. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest metastatic prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer is usually diagnosed in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The patient does not have any symptoms of metastatic prostate cancer, such as bone pain, weight loss, or fatigue.

 53%|█████▎    | 808/1525 [3:18:22<3:00:07, 15.07s/it]The correct diagnosis is secondary syphilis. This is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by a rash that can appear anywhere on the body, including the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. The rash is often described as annular, meaning that it has a central clearing surrounded by a raised border. It can also be associated with superficial erosions, which are small, open sores. In addition to the rash, secondary syphilis can also cause fever, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and fatigue.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. This results in the characteristic thick, red, scaly patches of psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most common on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. The lesions of psoriasis are not associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever or lymphadenopathy.

Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. The skin lesions of lupus erythematosus are often described as malar rash, which is a butterfly-shaped rash that appears on the cheeks and bridge of the nose. Lupus erythematosus can also cause hair loss, photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), and Raynaud's phenomenon (a condition that causes the fingers and toes to turn white, blue, or red when exposed to cold or stress). The lesions of lupus erythematosus are not associated with a corymbiform pattern.

T-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the T-cells, a type of white blood cell. The skin is the most common site of involvement in T-cell lymphoma, but the disease can also affect the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs. The skin lesions of T-cell lymphoma are often described as papulosquamous lesions, which are raised, scaly patches of skin. T-cell lymphoma can also cause lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. The lesions of T-cell lymphoma are not associated with a corymbiform pattern.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is secondary syphilis. This is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by a rash that can appear anywhere on the body, including the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. The rash is often described as annular, meaning that it has a central clearing surrounded by a raised border. It can also be associated with superficial erosions, which are small, open sores.

Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare form of sarcoidosis that affects the subcutaneous tissue, which is the layer of fat below the skin. It is characterized by the formation of hard, painless nodules that can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the arms and legs. The nodules may be single or multiple, and they can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.

The exact cause of subcutaneous sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. This can lead to the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of immune cells.

Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is most common in people of African descent, and it is more likely to occur in women than men. It is also more common in people with other autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease.

There is no cure for subcutaneous sarcoidosis, but the condition can often be managed with medication. Treatment typically involves the use of corticosteroids, which are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove large or painful nodules.

The prognosis for people with subcutaneous sarcoidosis is generally good. Most people with the condition experience a full recovery, although some may have recurrences.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's presentation.

A. Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and bone or joint infection. The patient's presentation does not suggest that he has sporotrichosis.

C. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare disorder that causes the formation of hard deposits of calcium salts in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The patient's presentation does not suggest that he has tumoral calcinosis.

The patient has a history of eczema and multiple food allergies, which has led to him following a restrictive diet. This diet is low in vitamin A, which is essential for good vision. The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, night blindness, and light sensitivity are all consistent with vitamin A deficiency. The physical examination findings of dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva (Bitot spots) and areas of marked corneal epitheliopathy with opacity are also consistent with vitamin A deficiency.

Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve, which can lead to vision loss. However, glaucoma does not typically cause night blindness or light sensitivity. The patient's physical examination findings are also not consistent with glaucoma.

Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disease that can cause dry eyes and dry mouth. However, Sjögren syndrome does not typically cause vision loss. The patient's physical examination findings are also not consistent with Sjögren syndrome.

Bilateral cataracts are a condition that causes clouding of the lens in the eye. Cataracts can lead to vision loss, but they do not typically cause night blindness or light sensitivity. The patient's physical examination findings are also not consistent with bilateral cataracts.

Lupus enteritis is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and tissues in the body. SLE is characterized by the production of autoantibodies that attack healthy cells and tissues. In lupus enteritis, these autoantibodies attack the lining of the small intestine, causing inflammation and damage.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with lupus enteritis. She has a history of SLE, and she is currently experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. These symptoms are typical of lupus enteritis. Additionally, her abdominal CT scan shows evidence of thickened small bowel, which is a characteristic finding of lupus enteritis.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Mesenteric ischemia is a condition in which the blood supply to the small intestine is blocked. This can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever, but it is not associated with a history of SLE. Superior mesenteric venous thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot forms in the superior mesenteric vein, which is a vein that carries blood away from the small intestine. This can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever, but it is also not associated with a history of SLE. Superior mesenteric artery embolism is a condition in which a blood clot forms in the superior mesenteric artery, which is an artery that carries blood to the small intestine. This can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever, but it is also not associated with a history of SLE.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Lupus enteritis. This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history, symptoms, and imaging findings.

The patient has bilateral optic nerve pallor, which is a sign of optic nerve atrophy. Optic nerve atrophy is a condition in which the optic nerve shrinks, causing vision loss. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, inflammation, and tumors. In this case, the patient's optic nerve atrophy is likely due to the traumatic injury he sustained to his legs.

There is no treatment for optic nerve atrophy, and the prognosis for vision loss is poor. In some cases, vision loss may be partial or even reversible, but in most cases, the vision loss is permanent.

The patient should be counseled on the prognosis of his condition and offered support and resources to help him cope with the vision loss. He should also be referred to a rehabilitation specialist to help him learn how to adapt to his new condition.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, Test patient with optokinetic nystagmus drum, is incorrect because optokinetic nystagmus is a test of the brain's ability to track moving objects. It is not a test of the optic nerves.
* Option B, Repeat magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, is incorrect because the patient's magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. There is no need to repeat the test.
* Option D, Test pupils with dilute pilocarpine, is incorrect because pilocarpine is a drug that is used to test the function of the pupils. The patient's pupils are nonreactive, so testing them with pilocarpine would not provide any useful information.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a number of possible diagnoses, including atypical trigeminal neuralgia, a brain tumor, and multiple sclerosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain with angiography is not the best test to evaluate for these conditions. A CT scan is a good test for identifying structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors and strokes. However, it is not as good at identifying inflammation or demyelination, which are the underlying causes of atypical trigeminal neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, and other neurological disorders.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain is a better test for evaluating these conditions. MRI scans can provide detailed images of the brain that can help to identify areas of inflammation or demyelination. In addition, MRI scans can be used to assess blood flow in the brain, which can be helpful in diagnosing strokes.

The patient's symptoms are also concerning for a possible infection of the trigeminal nerve. This type of infection can cause facial numbness, pain, and weakness. A contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the brain can help to identify areas of infection in the trigeminal nerve.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Order contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. This test is the best way to evaluate for the patient's possible diagnoses.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Order computed tomography of the brain with angiography. A CT scan of the brain with angiography is not the best test to evaluate for the patient's possible diagnoses.

However, it is not as good at identifying inflammation or demyelination, which are the underlying causes of atypical trigeminal neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, and other neurological disorders.
* B: Prescribe analgesia to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia and refer the patient to a neurologist. Prescribing analgesia to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia is not the best approach in this case. The patient's symptoms are concerning for a possible infection of the trigeminal nerve. This type of infection can cause facial numbness, pain, and weakness. A contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the brain can help to identify areas of infection in the trigeminal nerve. In addition, the patient's symptoms are also concerning for a number of other possible diagnoses, including a brain tumor and multiple sclerosis. A contrast-enhanced MRI scan of the brain is the best way to evaluate for these conditions.
* D: Continue treatment for blepharitis. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with blepharitis. Blepharitis is a common condition that causes inflammation of the eyelids.

A. Conduct genetic testing is incorrect because there is no evidence of a genetic disorder in this patient. The patient has no history of developmental delay, trauma, or systemic illness. Her ocular history was significant only for bilateral mixed astigmatism. There was no family history of strabismus, amblyopia, or congenital ptosis.

B. Perform urgent neuroimaging is incorrect because there is no evidence of a neurological disorder in this patient. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Pupils were reactive to light bilaterally, and there was neither an afferent pupillary defect nor anisocoria. Extraocular motility was full.

C. Start oral corticosteroids is incorrect because there is no evidence of an inflammatory disorder in this patient. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Pupils were reactive to light bilaterally, and there was neither an afferent pupillary defect nor anisocoria. Extraocular motility was full.

D. Discuss carefully observing vs surgical repair of the ptosis is the correct answer because this is the most appropriate management for a patient with unilateral congenital ptosis. The patient's ptosis is mild and does not affect her vision. She has no other ocular or systemic problems. Surgical repair of the ptosis is not necessary at this time. The patient should be monitored closely and the decision to proceed with surgery can be made at a later date.

The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of plasma cells. Plasma cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies. In multiple myeloma, the plasma cells become cancerous and produce too many abnormal antibodies. These abnormal antibodies can build up in the blood and cause problems, such as kidney failure.

The patient was treated with a combination of drugs, including elotuzumab. Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that are designed to bind to specific targets. In the case of elotuzumab, it binds to a protein called CD38, which is found on the surface of myeloma cells. When elotuzumab binds to CD38, it helps the body's immune system to kill the myeloma cells.

The patient's treatment was successful in reducing the amount of myeloma in his body. However, three weeks after starting treatment, he developed a new monoclonal protein. This new monoclonal protein was an IgG kappa protein, which is different from the IgA kappa protein that was originally detected.

The development of a new monoclonal protein is a known side effect of elotuzumab treatment. This is because elotuzumab can cause the immune system to produce more antibodies, including abnormal antibodies. In this case, the development of the new IgG kappa protein is likely due to the patient's treatment with elotuzumab.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: Clonal evolution of myeloma cells to both IgG- and IgA-secreting cells. This is not likely the explanation for the development of the new IgG kappa protein, as the patient was already diagnosed with multiple myeloma and was already producing an IgA kappa protein. It is more likely that the development of the new IgG kappa protein is due to the patient's treatment with elotuzumab.
* Choice B: Immune dysregulation from multiagent therapy resulting in a new M-protein. This is also not likely the explanation for the development of the new IgG kappa protein, as the patient was already diagnosed with multiple myeloma and was already producing an IgA kappa protein. It is more likely that the development of the new IgG kappa protein is due to the patient's treatment with elotuzumab.
* Choice C: New MGUS or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, such as monoclonal B lymphocytosis. This is also not likely the explanation for the development of the new IgG kappa protein, as the patient was already diagnosed with multiple myeloma and was already producing an IgA kappa protein. It is more likely that the development of the new IgG kappa protein is due to the patient's treatment with elotuzumab.

The patient in this case has a history of syncope, which is a sudden loss of consciousness. Syncope can be caused by a variety of conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and vasovagal syncope. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are not specific for any one cause of syncope. The chest radiography shows hilar adenopathy, which could be a sign of malignancy or infection. The electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left posterior fascicle block, and right bundle branch block. These findings are not specific for any one cause of syncope. The transthoracic echocardiography shows an ejection fraction of 50% without regional variation. This finding is not specific for any one cause of syncope. The exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography shows transient high-grade atrioventricular block but no ischemic ST-segment changes or defects on perfusion imaging. This finding is not specific for any one cause of syncope. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast-enhanced first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and contrast-enhanced late gadolinium enhancement imaging reveals low-normal left ventricular systolic function but no other abnormalities. This finding is not specific for any one cause of syncope.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and test results, the next step in the evaluation should be to order cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). FDG-PET is a nuclear medicine test that is used to assess myocardial metabolism. In patients with syncope, FDG-PET can be used to identify areas of the myocardium that are hypoperfused or that have decreased metabolic activity. This information can be helpful in determining the cause of syncope and in guiding treatment.

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this case. Invasive electrophysiologic testing is a procedure that is used to assess the electrical activity of the heart. It is not necessary in this case because the patient's electrocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are not suggestive of an arrhythmia. Coronary angiography is a procedure that is used to visualize the arteries that supply blood to the heart. It is not necessary in this case because the patient's exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography does not show any evidence of ischemia. Order 30-day event monitoring is a procedure that is used to record the patient's heart rhythm for 30 days. It is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of a cardiac arrhythmia.

The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). On posttransplant day 10, he developed fever (38.4°C). He was started on empirical treatment with cefepime; however, his fevers persisted despite antibiotic therapy. On posttransplant day 14 he developed new-onset pruritic, confluent, erythematous, blanching morbilliform macules and papules on his trunk and extremities.

The most likely diagnosis is drug-induced rash. The patient's rash is consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction to cefepime. Other possible causes of the rash include viral infection, fungal infection, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the patient's fevers and pulmonary infiltrates are not consistent with these diagnoses.

The patient should discontinue cefepime and start systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are effective in treating drug-induced rashes. The patient should also be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and worsening pulmonary infiltrates. If the rash worsens or the patient develops signs of infection, the patient may need to be treated with additional antibiotics or antifungals.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Initiate empirical antiviral and antifungal therapy is incorrect because the patient does not have any clinical or laboratory evidence of an infection.
* C. Obtain ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing is incorrect because these tests are not indicated in the management of drug-induced rash.
* D. Perform bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions is incorrect because the patient does not have any clinical or laboratory evidence of an infection.

The patient's pain medication regimen includes methadone, 20 mg [3×/d]; immediate-release morphine, 30 mg [5×/d]; gabapentin, 1200 mg [2×/d]; duloxetine, 60 mg/d; and celecoxib, 200 mg [2×/d].

Methadone is a long-acting opioid analgesic that is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is also used to treat opioid addiction. Methadone is metabolized in the liver to a number of metabolites, including morphine.

Morphine is a short-acting opioid analgesic that is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is also used to treat opioid addiction. Morphine is metabolized in the liver to a number of metabolites, including codeine.

The urine drug screen results show the presence of methadone and morphine. These results are consistent with the patient's medication regimen. The results do not show the presence of hydromorphone or codeine. Therefore, the patient is not taking hydromorphone or codeine.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* B. The patient is taking methadone and codeine. This choice is incorrect because the urine drug screen results do not show the presence of codeine.
* C. The patient is taking methadone, hydromorphone, and codeine. This choice is incorrect because the urine drug screen results do not show the presence of hydromorphone or codeine.
* D. The patient is taking methadone, morphine, hydromorphone, and codeine. This choice is incorrect because the urine drug screen results do not show the presence of hydromorphone or codeine.

The patient in the case presented with a history of spontaneous bruising, epistaxis, and haematuria. These symptoms are consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), a rare type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APML is characterized by the presence of a fusion gene between the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) gene. This fusion gene results in the production of a chimeric protein that blocks the differentiation of promyelocytes into mature granulocytes.

The patient was started on treatment with the PETHEMA LPA 20051 protocol consisting of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and idarubicin, an anthracycline based chemotherapy. ATRA is a retinoid that induces differentiation of promyelocytes into mature granulocytes. Idarubicin is a chemotherapy drug that kills cancer cells.

After 12 days of treatment, the patient developed pyrexia and was started on empiric antibiotics. Two days later he developed tender black spots on the scrotum that progressed to painful ulcers over 8 days. Systemic antifungal and antiviral therapy were added with no improvement. Peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify bacterial or viral infection. Scrotal ultrasonography showed a subcutaneous hypervascular lesion with no abscess. The development and progression of scrotal ulceration coincided with recovery in neutrophil count from 0.3 × 109/L to 1.2 × 109/L and persistent pyrexia. As scrotal ulceration progressed, they enlarged and became necrotic with a black eschar. A specimen was obtained for histopathology.

The histopathology specimen showed ulceration of the scrotal skin with underlying necrosis and inflammation. There was no evidence of infection with bacteria, fungi, or mycobacteria. The findings were consistent with scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA.

Scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA is a rare but serious complication of APML treatment. The condition is thought to be caused by the direct toxicity of ATRA on the scrotal skin. The risk of developing scrotal ulceration is increased in patients who have a low neutrophil count at the start of treatment.

The treatment of scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA is supportive. The ulcers are usually self-limiting and heal within a few weeks. However, in severe cases, surgical debridement may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Fournier gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum) is a life-threatening infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the perineum. It is caused by a variety of bacteria, including Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Fournier gangrene is characterized by rapid onset of fever, pain, and swelling of the perineum. The skin becomes necrotic and black eschar may form. Fournier gangrene is a surgical emergency and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics and debridement of necrotic tissue. The patient in the case did not have any of the classic features of Fournier gangrene, including fever, pain, and swelling of the perineum. The skin of his scrotum was not necrotic and there was no black eschar. Therefore, Fournier gangrene is not the correct diagnosis.
* Deep fungal infection is a rare but serious infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It is caused by a variety of fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Deep fungal infections are characterized by fever, pain, and swelling of the affected area. The skin may become necrotic and black eschar may form. Deep fungal infections are treated with antifungal medications. The patient in the case did not have any of the classic features of a deep fungal infection, including fever, pain, and swelling of the scrotum. The skin of his scrotum was not necrotic and there was no black eschar. Therefore, deep fungal infection is not the correct diagnosis.
* Mycobacterial infection is a rare but serious infection caused by bacteria of the Mycobacterium genus. Mycobacterial infections can affect any part of the body, including the skin. They are characterized by fever, pain, and swelling of the affected area. The skin may become necrotic and black eschar may form. Mycobacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. The patient in the case did not have any of the classic features of a mycobacterial infection, including fever, pain, and swelling of the scrotum. The skin of his scrotum was not necrotic and there was no black eschar. Therefore, mycobacterial infection is not the correct diagnosis.

 54%|█████▍    | 822/1525 [3:21:53<2:56:43, 15.08s/it]The correct answer is B. Malignant atrophic papulosis.

Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP) is a rare, idiopathic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the development of multiple, small, white, atrophic papules and scars. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities, and they may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.

The pathogenesis of MAP is not fully understood, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The lesions of MAP are thought to result from a combination of immune system dysregulation and damage to the blood vessels in the skin.

There is no cure for MAP, but the disease is usually self-limited and the lesions eventually resolve. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing complications.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's presentation.

A. Pancreatitis panniculitis is a rare, inflammatory disorder of the pancreas and subcutaneous fat. The lesions of pancreatitis panniculitis are typically painful and tender, and they may be associated with fever, weight loss, and jaundice.

C. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can affect many different organs and tissues in the body. The lesions of SLE are typically malar (butterfly-shaped) rash, discoid rash, and photosensitivity.

D. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by the development of multiple, small, red-brown papules. The lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis are typically self-limited and resolve within a few months.

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease in which antibodies are directed against the hemidesmosomal protein BP180. It is characterized by tense blisters that arise at the subepidermal level. The blisters are typically non-scarring, and they may be associated with pruritus.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an autoimmune blistering disease in which antibodies are directed against the anchoring fibrils of the basement membrane zone. It is characterized by blisters that arise at the dermal-epidermal junction. The blisters are typically scarring, and they may be associated with pain and tenderness.

Linear IgA dermatosis is an autoimmune blistering disease in which antibodies are directed against the lamina lucida of the basement membrane zone. It is characterized by blisters that arise at the subepidermal level. The blisters are typically non-scarring, and they may be associated with pruritus.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of pruritic erythema on the trunk and extremities that did not respond to topical corticosteroid, oral roxithromycin (300 mg/d), or narrow-band UV-B phototherapy. The patient also had a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and was treated with glimepiride, sitagliptin phosphate hydrate, and amlodipine besylate. The patient also had polymyalgia, which was treated with a low dose of prednisolone. The prednisolone therapy had been discontinued 2 months before her visit to the dermatology clinic when she had been hospitalized with pneumonia. Multiple tense blisters had subsequently appeared on the palms. Physical examination at the first visit revealed scaly erythematous plaques on the whole body and tense blisters on the arms, hands, soles, and buttocks. Neither scar formation or mucosal involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a bulla on the forearm. Histopathologic analysis revealed a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils. The results of an IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 noncollagenous (NC) 16A were negative. After treatment with oral prednisolone, 20 mg/d, the lesions healed without scar or milia formation.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disease that is characterized by subepidermal blisters. The disease is caused by antibodies directed against the laminin γ1 chain of the basement membrane zone. The blisters are typically non-scarring, and they may be associated with pruritus. The disease is typically treated with oral corticosteroids.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by tense blisters that arise at the subepidermal level. The blisters are typically scarring, and they may be associated with pruritus. In this case, the blisters were non-scarring.
* Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is characterized by blisters that arise at the dermal-epidermal junction. The blisters are typically scarring, and they may be associated with pain and tenderness. In this case, the blisters were non-scarring.
* Linear IgA dermatosis is characterized by blisters that arise at the subepidermal level. The blisters are typically non-scarring, and they may be associated with pruritus. In this case, the blisters were non-scarring.

 54%|█████▍    | 824/1525 [3:22:26<3:04:12, 15.77s/it]The correct diagnosis is Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), a rare, autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fever, urticaria, arthralgias, and sensorineural hearing loss. The median age of onset is 2 years, and the disease typically follows a relapsing and remitting course.

The classic triad of symptoms in MWS is fever, urticaria, and arthralgias. The fevers are typically recurrent and high-grade, and they may last for several days. The urticaria is nonpruritic and typically involves the trunk and extremities. The arthralgias are usually migratory and involve the large joints.

Other features of MWS that may be present include sensorineural hearing loss, kidney disease, and eye problems. The hearing loss is typically progressive and may lead to deafness. The kidney disease may manifest as proteinuria, hematuria, and nephrotic syndrome. The eye problems may include uveitis, scleritis, and episcleritis.

The diagnosis of MWS is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory testing. The laboratory findings in MWS may include elevated levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6. Genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for MWS, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and colchicine. In some cases, immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary.

The prognosis for patients with MWS is variable. Some patients have a mild form of the disease with few complications, while others have a more severe form with significant morbidity and mortality. The major causes of death in MWS are kidney disease and sepsis.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Chronic urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by hives that last for more than 6 weeks. It is not associated with fever, arthralgias, or hearing loss.
* Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is a rare, autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fever, urticaria, and arthralgias that are precipitated by exposure to cold. It is not associated with hearing loss.
* Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID) is a rare, autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterized by fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. It is not associated with urticaria or hearing loss.

 54%|█████▍    | 825/1525 [3:22:41<3:03:58, 15.77s/it]The correct answer is D. Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm is a blood-filled sac that forms when the wall of an artery is damaged. This can happen due to trauma, infection, or medical procedures such as catheterization. In this case, the patient developed a pseudoaneurysm after an attempt to insert a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) into the right basilic vein. The PICC is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into a vein in the arm and threaded into the heart. It is used to deliver medication or fluids directly into the bloodstream.

The most common symptom of a pseudoaneurysm is pain and swelling in the affected area. The swelling may be warm and tender to the touch. In some cases, the pseudoaneurysm may rupture, which can lead to serious bleeding.

To diagnose a pseudoaneurysm, a doctor will perform a physical examination and order imaging tests such as an ultrasound or an MRI. Treatment for a pseudoaneurysm typically involves surgery to repair the damaged artery. In some cases, a procedure called thrombin injection may be used to close the pseudoaneurysm.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity: This is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a deep vein in the arm. It is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, such as pain, swelling, and redness in the arm.
* Compartment syndrome resulting from infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues of the upper extremity: This is a condition in which the pressure inside a muscle compartment increases, causing damage to the nerves and muscles. It is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome, such as pain, swelling, and numbness in the arm.
* Secondary lymphedema of the upper extremity: This is a condition in which the lymph nodes in the arm become swollen and blocked. It is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of lymphedema, such as swelling, pain, and tenderness in the arm.

 54%|█████▍    | 826/1525 [3:22:53<2:49:53, 14.58s/it]The correct answer is C. Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm.

Acute abdominal pain in a man in his 50s with a history of smoking and chronic hypertension is a common presentation. The differential diagnosis is broad, but the most likely causes in this patient are:

* Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm
* Acute perforation of a bleeding peptic ulcer
* Hemorrhagic pancreatitis
* Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm

Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm is a rare but serious condition that can be fatal if not treated promptly. It is most commonly seen in patients with atherosclerosis, hypertension, and smoking. The diagnosis is often made on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or angiography. Treatment typically involves surgical repair of the aneurysm.

Acute perforation of a bleeding peptic ulcer is another common cause of acute abdominal pain in the elderly. It is usually caused by a break in the lining of the stomach or duodenum, which allows stomach acid and digestive enzymes to leak into the abdominal cavity. This can cause severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and shock. The diagnosis is often made on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as CT or endoscopy. Treatment typically involves surgery to repair the ulcer and stop the bleeding.

Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is a serious condition that can occur when the pancreas becomes inflamed and bleeds. It is most commonly seen in patients with gallstones, alcohol abuse, and certain medications. The diagnosis is often made on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as fluid resuscitation and pain management. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to drain the pancreas or remove a part of the organ.

Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm is a rare condition that can occur when a collection of blood (hematoma) forms around the pancreas. It is most commonly seen in patients with pancreatitis, trauma, or infection. The diagnosis is often made on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as CT or angiography. Treatment typically involves surgery to drain the hematoma or repair the aneurysm.

In this case, the patient's history of smoking and chronic hypertension makes him a high-risk for developing a jejunal artery aneurysm. His presentation with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting is also consistent with a ruptured aneurysm. The CT scan shows an intra-abdominal hyperdense mass (arrowhead) and free fluid in the upper abdomen, which are both suggestive of a ruptured aneurysm. The mesenteric angiogram reveals an aneurysm (arrowhead), which confirms the diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm.

 54%|█████▍    | 827/1525 [3:23:10<2:58:02, 15.30s/it]The correct answer is C. Treat with oral corticosteroids.

The patient has a choroidal mass that is causing a shallow anterior chamber and serous retinal detachment. The mass is non-enhancing on MRI, which suggests that it is not a malignant tumor. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is already clear. Plaque radiotherapy is also not necessary, as the mass is not malignant. Sclerotomies (creation of scleral windows) are only necessary if the choroidal detachment is causing severe pain or visual loss. In this case, the patient is only experiencing mild symptoms, so sclerotomies are not necessary.

Oral corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for choroidal masses that are causing a shallow anterior chamber and serous retinal detachment. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and swelling, which can help to improve the symptoms and prevent further vision loss. In this case, the patient should be started on a course of oral corticosteroids and followed closely by an ophthalmologist.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* FNAB is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is already clear. The mass is non-enhancing on MRI, which suggests that it is not a malignant tumor.
* Plaque radiotherapy is also not necessary, as the mass is not malignant. Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment option for malignant choroidal tumors, but it is not necessary for benign tumors.
* Sclerotomies (creation of scleral windows) are only necessary if the choroidal detachment is causing severe pain or visual loss. In this case, the patient is only experiencing mild symptoms, so sclerotomies are not necessary.

 54%|█████▍    | 828/1525 [3:23:27<3:01:50, 15.65s/it]The correct answer is C: Obtain blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.

The patient in the case study presents with several symptoms consistent with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, including bilateral mydriasis with a reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation, progressive generalized autonomic dysfunction, and a negative workup for other causes of these symptoms. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is an autoimmune disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. The disorder can cause a variety of symptoms, including those that the patient in the case study is experiencing.

Obtaining a blood sample to test for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. If the test is positive, it will confirm the diagnosis and allow the patient to receive treatment for the disorder. If the test is negative, it will help to rule out autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and allow the physician to consider other possible diagnoses.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Prescribing phototropic variofocal glasses would not treat the underlying cause of the patient's mydriasis, and starting pilocarpine eyedrops would not treat the underlying cause of the patient's autonomic dysfunction. Recommending genetic testing would not be helpful at this stage in the patient's management, as the patient has already undergone a negative workup for other causes of their symptoms.

UBM is a type of ultrasound that is used to image the anterior segment of the eye. It is particularly useful in evaluating the structures of the iris and the ciliary body. In this case, UBM would be helpful in evaluating the peaked pupil and determining if there is any evidence of tumor recurrence.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Continue administering mitomycin C and schedule a follow-up visit in 6 to 8 weeks. This is not the best option because it does not address the underlying cause of the peaked pupil, which is likely tumor recurrence.
* C. Biopsy the limbal area around 9:30. This is not the best option because it is a destructive procedure that may not be necessary. A more conservative approach, such as UBM, should be used first.
* D. Delay mitomycin C therapy for a few weeks. This is not the best option because it does not address the underlying cause of the peaked pupil, which is likely tumor recurrence.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with congenitally anomalous optic nerves. This is a rare condition in which the optic nerves are abnormally shaped. It can cause visual field loss, but it is usually not progressive.

In this case, the patient's visual field loss has been stable for 5 years. This suggests that it is not due to a progressive condition such as glaucoma. The patient's intraocular pressure is also within the normal range.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's visual field loss is congenitally anomalous optic nerves. The patient should be reassured that this is a benign condition and that his vision is not at risk. However, he should have an annual evaluation to monitor his visual field.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Remote ischemic optic neuropathy is a condition that can cause sudden vision loss. It is not consistent with the patient's history and examination findings.
* B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary in this case. The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with congenitally anomalous optic nerves.
* D. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is a treatment for glaucoma. It is not indicated in this case because the patient's intraocular pressure is within the normal range.

The patient is a 34-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy requiring a heart transplant 11 months earlier. He is now presenting with subacute onset of shortness of breath, new ST elevations on ECG, and an apical thrombus on echocardiogram. These findings are concerning for acute coronary syndrome, which is a leading cause of death after heart transplant.

The next step in management is to order an emergent coronary angiogram to assess for coronary artery disease. This is the most definitive way to diagnose acute coronary syndrome and to determine the best course of treatment. If coronary artery disease is found, the patient may need to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

In addition to a coronary angiogram, an endomyocardial biopsy should also be performed. This procedure involves taking a small sample of heart muscle to assess for rejection. Rejection is a common complication after heart transplant, and it can cause a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. If rejection is found, the patient will need to be treated with immunosuppressive medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option B, checking cytomegalovirus viral load, is not the next step in management. Cytomegalovirus is a viral infection that can cause heart problems in transplant patients. However, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case. Option C, administering empirical pulse-dose corticosteroids, is also not the next step in management. Corticosteroids are immunosuppressive medications that can be used to treat rejection. However, they should not be given empirically without first confirming the diagnosis of rejection. Option D, performing an endomyocardial biopsy alone, is also not the next step in management. An endomyocardial biopsy can be helpful in diagnosing rejection, but it is not a definitive test. A coronary angiogram is needed to assess for coronary artery disease, which is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.

Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the skin that is characterized by a well-demarcated, erythematous, and edematous plaque. It is most commonly caused by group A streptococcus, but can also be caused by other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Erysipelas is typically seen in older adults and in people with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lymphedema, or alcoholism. The most common symptom of erysipelas is a sudden onset of fever, chills, and malaise. The skin lesion is typically warm, tender, and indurated. Erysipelas can spread to other parts of the body, such as the face, neck, and extremities. If left untreated, erysipelas can lead to serious complications, such as sepsis and death.

Radiation dermatitis is a skin condition that can develop after radiation therapy. It is caused by damage to the skin cells from the radiation. Radiation dermatitis can range from mild to severe, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including redness, itching, pain, and blistering. In severe cases, radiation dermatitis can lead to scarring and loss of skin.

Radiation-induced morphea is a rare skin condition that can develop after radiation therapy. It is characterized by the formation of hard, thickened skin plaques. Radiation-induced morphea is typically seen in people who have received radiation therapy to the head or neck. The condition is often asymptomatic, but can cause pain, itching, and numbness. Radiation-induced morphea is not life-threatening, but can be disfiguring.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the skin. The patient's skin lesions are consistent with carcinoma erysipeloides, which is a rare form of cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer. Carcinoma erysipeloides is characterized by the development of erythematous, edematous plaques on the skin that are associated with underlying breast cancer. The diagnosis of carcinoma erysipeloides is confirmed by biopsy, which reveals the presence of metastatic breast cancer cells in the skin.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the skin, and radiation dermatitis and radiation-induced morphea are both skin conditions that can develop after radiation therapy. However, these conditions do not explain the patient's history of breast cancer or the presence of metastatic breast cancer cells in the skin.

A. Administering topical antifungals is not the correct answer because the lesions are not caused by a fungal infection.

B. Taking a more detailed drug history is not the correct answer because the lesions are not caused by a drug reaction.

C. Performing a skeletal survey and referring for ophthalmologic consultation is not the correct answer because the lesions are not associated with any skeletal or ocular abnormalities.

D. Stroking the skin lesion is the correct answer because it is a common way to test for café au lait spots, which are a type of birthmark that is often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Café au lait spots are flat, brown macules that can appear anywhere on the body. They are usually harmless, but they can be a sign of NF1, a genetic disorder that can cause tumors to grow on the nerves. If you are concerned about a café au lait spot, you should see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

Here are some additional information about café au lait spots:

* Café au lait spots are usually present at birth or appear within the first few years of life.
* They are more common in people with darker skin.
* The number and size of café au lait spots can vary from person to person.
* Café au lait spots are usually harmless, but they can be a sign of NF1.
* If you have café au lait spots, you should see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for proliferative glomerulonephritis. She also has elevated serum creatinine, which is a marker of kidney damage. The urine studies show proteinuria, hematuria, and red blood cell casts, which are all characteristic of proliferative glomerulonephritis. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

A urinary tract infection is unlikely because the patient does not have any symptoms of a urinary tract infection, such as fever, flank pain, or dysuria. Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis is unlikely because the patient has proteinuria, hematuria, and red blood cell casts, which are all characteristic of proliferative glomerulonephritis. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is unlikely because the patient does not have any signs of hypertensive retinopathy or left ventricular hypertrophy, which are both common in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis.

In conclusion, the patient most likely has proliferative glomerulonephritis. This is a serious condition that can lead to kidney failure. The patient should be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and treatment.

 55%|█████▍    | 835/1525 [3:24:52<2:34:33, 13.44s/it]The correct answer is B. Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease.

Pemphigus foliaceus, IgA pemphigus, and pemphigus vulgaris are all autoimmune bullous diseases characterized by the formation of blisters in the skin. However, they are all distinct entities with different clinical features, histopathology, and treatment.

Pemphigus foliaceus is characterized by flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving behind eroded or crusted areas. The lesions are typically located on the scalp, face, and upper trunk. Histologically, pemphigus foliaceus is characterized by suprabasilar acantholysis, which is the separation of cells in the epidermis. Treatment is with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs.

IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the basement membrane zone of the skin. The lesions are typically blisters and erosions that are located on the oral mucosa, but they can also occur on the skin. Histologically, IgA pemphigus is characterized by subepithelial blister formation and the deposition of IgA antibodies in the basement membrane zone. Treatment is with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs.

Pemphigus vulgaris is a severe autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the formation of flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving behind eroded or crusted areas. The lesions are typically located on the oral mucosa, but they can also occur on the skin. Histologically, pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by suprabasilar acantholysis. Treatment is with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs.

In the case of the patient presented in the question, the most likely diagnosis is generalized Hailey-Hailey disease. This is because the patient has a long-standing history of recurrent skin lesions limited to the axillae and groin, which are the typical sites of involvement in Hailey-Hailey disease. The patient also has multiple annular erythematous plaques surrounded by a peripheral crusted and pustular collarette on her trunk, which is a characteristic clinical presentation of Hailey-Hailey disease. Histologically, the biopsy specimens revealed suprabasilar acantholysis, which is the hallmark of Hailey-Hailey disease.

The other possible diagnoses, pemphigus foliaceus, IgA pemphigus, and pemphigus vulgaris, are less likely in this case. This is because the patient does not have any of the typical clinical features of these diseases, such as flaccid blisters that rupture easily, oral lesions, or subepithelial blister formation. Histologically, the biopsy specimens did not show any evidence of IgA deposition in the basement membrane zone or of suprabasilar acantholysis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient presented in the question is generalized Hailey-Hailey disease.

 55%|█████▍    | 836/1525 [3:25:06<2:34:43, 13.47s/it]The correct answer is D. Oral melanoacanthoma.

Oral melanoacanthoma is a rare, benign neoplasm that is characterized by a proliferation of melanocytes in the epithelium of the oral mucosa. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly adults, and there is a slight female predilection. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and solitary, but they can be multiple. They most commonly occur on the gingiva, but they can also be found on the buccal mucosa, lips, tongue, and palate. The lesions are usually brown or black in color, and they can be smooth or verrucous in appearance. Biopsy is usually required to make the diagnosis, and the histopathologic features are characteristic of oral melanoacanthoma. The treatment of oral melanoacanthoma is usually surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the patient's presentation.

* Oral melanotic macule is a benign lesion that is characterized by a localized area of increased pigmentation in the oral mucosa. It is most commonly seen in older adults, and there is no gender predilection. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and solitary, but they can be multiple. They most commonly occur on the buccal mucosa, lips, and tongue. The lesions are usually brown or black in color, and they are flat or slightly raised. Biopsy is usually not required to make the diagnosis, and the histopathologic features are non-specific. The treatment of oral melanotic macule is usually not necessary, but it can be removed if it is cosmetically unacceptable. The prognosis is excellent.
* Oral malignant melanoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of melanocytes in the oral mucosa. It is most commonly seen in older adults, and there is no gender predilection. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and solitary, but they can be multiple. They most commonly occur on the gingiva, but they can also be found on the buccal mucosa, lips, tongue, and palate. The lesions are usually black in color, and they can be smooth or verrucous in appearance. Biopsy is usually required to make the diagnosis, and the histopathologic features are characteristic of oral malignant melanoma. The treatment of oral malignant melanoma is usually surgical excision with adjuvant therapy, and the prognosis is poor.
* Oral melanocytic nevus is a benign lesion that is characterized by a localized proliferation of melanocytes in the oral mucosa. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and there is no gender predilection. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and solitary, but they can be multiple. They most commonly occur on the lips, but they can also be found on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and palate. The lesions are usually brown or black in color, and they are flat or slightly raised. Biopsy is usually not required to make the diagnosis, and the histopathologic features are non-specific. The treatment of oral melanocytic nevus is usually not necessary, but it can be removed if it is cosmetically unacceptable. The prognosis is excellent.

The patient is a female infant with relapsed refractory infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia, blast crisis (>60% blasts), and central nervous system involvement. She was admitted for reinduction chemotherapy with cytarabine, vincristine, daunorubicin, methotrexate, and dexamethasone. Seventeen days after her last day of chemotherapy, while neutropenic, she became febrile and developed several vesicles with an erythematous base on the lower back (Figure, A) and left thigh. Tissue and blood cultures and a punch biopsy specimen of a vesicle on the lower back were obtained. Hematoxylin-eosin (Figures, B and C), gram (Figure, D), and periodic acid-Schiff stains were performed on the punch biopsy. Testing for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus were also ordered.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with a cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in soil and water. It can cause a variety of infections, including food poisoning, pneumonia, and meningitis. In immunocompromised patients, such as the patient in this case, Bacillus cereus can also cause cutaneous infections.

The skin lesions in this patient are consistent with a cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. The lesions are vesicles with an erythematous base, which is a typical presentation of this type of infection. The Gram stain of the biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods, which are also consistent with a Bacillus cereus infection. The patient's blood cultures were negative for Bacillus cereus, but this is not surprising, as blood cultures are often negative in patients with cutaneous Bacillus cereus infections.

The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics, and her skin lesions resolved. She made a good recovery and was discharged from the hospital.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of genital herpes and oral herpes. It is not a common cause of skin infections in immunocompromised patients.
* B. Disseminated varicella zoster virus is a serious infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients. It is characterized by a disseminated rash of vesicles. The patient in this case does not have a disseminated rash.
* C. Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients. It is characterized by fever, headache, and meningitis. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

 55%|█████▍    | 838/1525 [3:25:39<2:52:41, 15.08s/it]The correct answer is C. Neurocutaneous melanosis.

Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of melanocytic lesions (nevus) in the skin and central nervous system (CNS). The disorder is caused by mutations in the N-ras-2 gene, which is responsible for the production of a protein called ras. Ras is a protein that is involved in cell signaling, and mutations in the ras gene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division.

The clinical features of neurocutaneous melanosis vary depending on the location and number of melanocytic lesions. The most common skin lesions are congenital nevi, which are present at birth. Congenital nevi can be small or large, and they can be flat or raised. They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk and extremities.

Melanocytic lesions in the CNS can occur in the brain, spinal cord, or meninges (the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord). CNS lesions can be benign or malignant. Benign lesions are noncancerous, while malignant lesions are cancerous. Malignant lesions are the most serious complication of neurocutaneous melanosis, and they can be life-threatening.

The diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis is based on the clinical features and the results of imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. MRI and CT scans can help to identify the location and size of the melanocytic lesions.

There is no cure for neurocutaneous melanosis, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment options for neurocutaneous melanosis include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The prognosis for patients with neurocutaneous melanosis depends on the location and number of melanocytic lesions, as well as the presence of any malignant lesions. Patients with only benign lesions in the skin have a good prognosis. However, patients with malignant lesions in the CNS have a poor prognosis, and they may die from the disease.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Metastatic melanoma is a type of cancer that occurs when melanoma cells spread from the skin to other parts of the body. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of metastatic melanoma, as there are no lesions in the skin that suggest that the cancer has spread.
* Primary intracranial melanoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the brain. The patient in this case does have lesions in the brain, but they are not consistent with primary intracranial melanoma. The lesions are more consistent with neurocutaneous melanosis.
* Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of lymphoma, as there are no enlarged lymph nodes.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is C. Neurocutaneous melanosis.

 55%|█████▌    | 839/1525 [3:25:50<2:38:55, 13.90s/it]The correct answer is B. Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis).

Pyomyositis is an infection of the muscle, usually caused by bacteria. It is characterized by fever, pain, and swelling of the muscle. In severe cases, it can lead to abscess formation and necrosis of the muscle. The patient in this case did not have fever, and the swelling and purpura were not confined to the muscle. Therefore, pyomyositis is not the most likely diagnosis.

Retained foreign body is a foreign object that is left in the body after surgery or injury. It can cause inflammation and infection. The patient in this case did not have a history of surgery or injury to the thigh, and there was no evidence of a foreign object on physical examination or imaging studies. Therefore, retained foreign body is not the most likely diagnosis.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection of the skin and underlying tissues. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain, swelling, and necrosis. The patient in this case did not have the rapid progression of symptoms that is characteristic of necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, the skin biopsy showed no evidence of infection. Therefore, necrotizing fasciitis is not the most likely diagnosis.

Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis) is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by purplish discoloration of the skin. It is thought to be caused by inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin. The patient in this case had a history of intramuscular injection in the thigh, and the purpura was confined to the area of the injection. In addition, the skin biopsy showed evidence of inflammation of the blood vessels. Therefore, Nicolau syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.

 55%|█████▌    | 840/1525 [3:26:02<2:30:33, 13.19s/it]The correct diagnosis is ectopic ovarian torsion.

Perforated appendicitis is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed and ruptures. This can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. However, the patient in this case did not have a fever, and her abdominal pain did not localize to the right lower quadrant. Additionally, her abdominal ultrasonography images showed no evidence of appendicitis.

Meckel diverticulitis is a condition in which a small, outpouching of the lining of the small intestine becomes inflamed. This can cause abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. However, the patient in this case did not have a fever, and her abdominal pain did not localize to the right lower quadrant. Additionally, her abdominal ultrasonography images showed no evidence of Meckel diverticulitis.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. This can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. However, the patient in this case did not have a fever, and her abdominal pain did not localize to the right lower quadrant. Additionally, her abdominal ultrasonography images showed no evidence of Crohn disease.

Ectopic ovarian torsion is a condition in which an ovary becomes twisted on its own blood supply. This can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient in this case presented with abdominal pain that localized to the right lower quadrant, anorexia, nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, voluntary guarding, and focal right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation. Her laboratory analyses demonstrated a mild leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasonography images obtained at the referring facility failed to show her appendix and demonstrated no secondary signs of inflammation. Computed tomography images of the abdomen and pelvis obtained at our facility demonstrated an inflamed retrocecal mass. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ectopic ovarian torsion.

The treatment for ectopic ovarian torsion is surgical detorsion. This is usually performed laparoscopically, which involves making small incisions in the abdomen and inserting a camera and surgical instruments. The ovary is then untwisted and sutured in place to prevent it from twisting again.

The prognosis for patients with ectopic ovarian torsion is generally good. Most patients make a full recovery after surgery. However, if the ovary is not detorsed within 24 hours, it may die. This can lead to infertility.

 55%|█████▌    | 841/1525 [3:26:18<2:41:36, 14.18s/it]The correct answer is B. Spontaneous chylothorax.

Acute jugular thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot forms in one of the jugular veins, which are large veins that drain blood from the head and neck to the heart. This can cause swelling and pain in the neck, as well as headache, fever, and difficulty breathing. However, acute jugular thrombosis is not typically associated with chest pain or pleural effusions, and it would not be expected to cause the findings seen on the patient's CT scan.

Contained esophageal perforation is a condition in which a hole develops in the esophagus, the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. This can cause chest pain, fever, and difficulty swallowing. However, contained esophageal perforation is not typically associated with swelling in the neck or pleural effusions, and it would not be expected to cause the findings seen on the patient's CT scan.

Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a serious infection of the mediastinum, the space in the chest that contains the heart, lungs, and other organs. This can cause fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. However, descending necrotizing mediastinitis is not typically associated with swelling in the neck or pleural effusions, and it would not be expected to cause the findings seen on the patient's CT scan.

Spontaneous chylothorax is a condition in which chyle, a milky fluid that contains lymph and fat, leaks into the chest cavity. This can cause chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. It is often caused by a tear in the thoracic duct, the main lymphatic vessel that drains lymph from the chest and upper abdomen. Spontaneous chylothorax is a rare condition, but it is more common in people with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, connective tissue disorders, and HIV/AIDS.

The patient in the case presented with several symptoms that are consistent with spontaneous chylothorax, including chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The patient also had swelling in the neck and pleural effusions, which are both common findings in spontaneous chylothorax. The patient's CT scan also showed findings that are consistent with spontaneous chylothorax, such as mediastinal edema and bilateral pleural effusions.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is spontaneous chylothorax.

 55%|█████▌    | 842/1525 [3:26:35<2:50:36, 14.99s/it]The correct answer is C: Evaluate for systemic infectious disease.

The patient presented with aseptic meningitis, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by fever, headache, and a stiff neck in the absence of bacterial meningitis. Aseptic meningitis can be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In the United States, the most common cause of aseptic meningitis is viral meningitis, which is typically caused by enteroviruses.

The patient in this case had a number of clinical features that are suggestive of viral meningitis, including fever, headache, neck stiffness, and a left-shifted leukocytosis. In addition, her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were suggestive of aseptic meningitis, with elevated protein levels and increased neutrophils.

The patient's blurred vision on day 2 of her hospitalization is concerning for a complication of viral meningitis, such as optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause blurred vision, pain in the eye, and a loss of color vision. It is a common complication of viral meningitis, and it can be a sign of serious underlying disease.

In the setting of a patient with aseptic meningitis and new-onset blurred vision, it is important to evaluate for systemic infectious disease. This includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as laboratory testing, such as blood cultures and a lumbar puncture. In addition, imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, may be helpful to rule out other causes of the patient's blurred vision.

Therapy for aseptic meningitis is supportive. This includes providing the patient with adequate fluids and electrolytes, as well as medications to relieve headache and fever. In some cases, antiviral medications may be used to treat the underlying infectious agent.

The patient in this case was diagnosed with viral meningitis and was treated with supportive care. She made a good recovery and her blurred vision resolved.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not appropriate for the patient's clinical presentation.

* Option A: Initiate systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are not indicated for the treatment of viral meningitis. In fact, they may actually worsen the patient's symptoms.
* Option B: Treat with an intraocular corticosteroid injection. Intraocular corticosteroid injections are not indicated for the treatment of optic neuritis. In fact, they may actually worsen the patient's condition.
* Option D: Begin administering intravenous acyclovir. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. It is not indicated for the treatment of viral meningitis.

 55%|█████▌    | 843/1525 [3:26:51<2:54:48, 15.38s/it]The correct answer is C. Order computed tomography of the head/facial bones.

The patient has a deep midfacial laceration with a significant amount of clear fluid draining from the wound site. This suggests that the laceration may have penetrated the nasolacrimal duct, which is a small tube that carries tears from the eye to the nose. If the nasolacrimal duct is damaged, it can lead to a condition called nasolacrimal duct obstruction, which can cause a buildup of tears in the eye and a persistent discharge of mucus or pus from the nose.

A computed tomography (CT) scan is a type of X-ray that can provide detailed images of the bones and soft tissues of the head and face. A CT scan can be used to assess the extent of the laceration and to determine if the nasolacrimal duct has been damaged. If the nasolacrimal duct has been damaged, the patient may need surgery to repair the duct.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Perform nasolacrimal duct irrigation is not the correct first step because it is not possible to know for sure whether the nasolacrimal duct has been damaged without further evaluation.
* Option B: Explore, irrigate, and close the wound is not the correct first step because it is not possible to close the wound without first repairing the nasolacrimal duct, if it has been damaged.
* Option D: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the head is not the correct first step because a CT scan is a more appropriate imaging modality for assessing the bones and soft tissues of the head and face.

 55%|█████▌    | 844/1525 [3:27:07<2:57:35, 15.65s/it]The correct answer is B: Obtain more information on the patient's history.

The patient in this case has developed multiple spots of retinal whitening with tiny intraretinal hemorrhages concentrated in the posterior pole after undergoing cataract surgery in the right eye. This is a concerning finding, as it could be a sign of a number of serious conditions, including infectious retinitis, autoimmune retinopathy, or a reaction to the surgical procedure.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's retinal whitening, it is important to obtain more information on her history. This includes her medical history, her ocular history, and her medication history. It is also important to ask about any recent changes in her vision, as well as any systemic symptoms she may be experiencing.

Once the patient's history has been obtained, a physical examination will be performed. This will include a dilated fundus examination, which will allow the doctor to see the retina in more detail. The doctor may also order additional tests, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or visual field testing.

The results of the physical examination and diagnostic tests will help the doctor to determine the cause of the patient's retinal whitening. Once the cause has been determined, the doctor can then recommend the appropriate treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not represent the best course of action for this patient.

A: Start systemic steroids. Systemic steroids are a type of medication that can be used to treat inflammation. However, in this case, there is no evidence that the patient's retinal whitening is caused by inflammation. Therefore, starting systemic steroids would not be the best course of action.

C: Vitreous tap and injection of foscarnet. A vitreous tap is a procedure in which a small amount of fluid is removed from the vitreous, the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye. Foscarnet is an antiviral medication that can be injected into the vitreous to treat viral retinitis. However, in this case, there is no evidence that the patient's retinal whitening is caused by a virus. Therefore, a vitreous tap and injection of foscarnet would not be the best course of action.

D: Infectious and autoimmune workup. An infectious and autoimmune workup is a series of tests that can be used to identify infections or autoimmune conditions. However, in this case, there is no evidence that the patient's retinal whitening is caused by an infection or an autoimmune condition. Therefore, an infectious and autoimmune workup would not be the best course of action.

The patient has a dual-chamber pacemaker implant for intermittent symptomatic second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The AV delay is the time between the atrial pacing stimulus and the ventricular pacing stimulus. A longer AV delay can cause symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue. In this case, the patient has been experiencing generalized weakness and fatigue for several weeks. The most likely cause of these symptoms is a prolonged AV delay.

Shortening the AV delay will allow the ventricles to contract more forcefully, which will improve cardiac output and relieve the patient's symptoms. Increasing the atrial pacing rate or the postventricular atrial refractory period will not improve the patient's symptoms. Referencing the patient for pacemaker lead revision is not necessary at this time.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Increase the atrial pacing rate to 70 beats per minute. This would increase the heart rate, but it would not address the underlying problem of the prolonged AV delay.
* B. Shorten the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds. This would allow the ventricles to contract more forcefully, which would improve cardiac output and relieve the patient's symptoms.
* C. Increase the postventricular atrial refractory period to 250 milliseconds. This would prevent the pacemaker from pacing the ventricles prematurely, but it would not address the underlying problem of the prolonged AV delay.
* D. Refer the patient for pacemaker lead revision. This is not necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms are likely due to a prolonged AV delay, which can be treated by shortening the programmed AV delay.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is typically a raised, red or purple lesion that can occur anywhere on the body. Hemangiomas are most common in infants and children, but they can occur in adults as well.

Neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of skin disorders characterized by inflammation and an increase in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. These disorders can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and medication reactions.

Leukemia cutis is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the presence of leukemia cells in the skin. Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood cells. Leukemia cutis can occur as a primary skin cancer or as a secondary manifestation of systemic leukemia.

The patient in the case presented with multiple painful cutaneous nodules that had developed over the previous 2 months. The patient had a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, diagnosed approximately 6 months earlier. Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. The patient's plasmacytoma is a localized growth of plasma cells that is likely a metastasis from her multiple myeloma.

The patient's physical examination revealed scattered red-violaceous nodules, with the largest measuring approximately 6.0 × 5.5 × 2.5 cm. These lesions are consistent with the appearance of plasmacytomas. The patient's serum protein levels were normal. This is not consistent with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which is typically associated with an elevated level of monoclonal protein in the blood.

An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis of the largest lesion on the patient’s right shoulder were performed. The biopsy revealed a proliferation of plasma cells with a monoclonal immunoglobulin Gκ light chain restriction. This is consistent with the diagnosis of plasmacytoma.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and biopsy results are all consistent with the diagnosis of plasmacytoma. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

The patient is at high risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) due to his underlying granulomatous polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and mild pulmonary fibrosis. He also has several clinical features of IPA, including worsening dyspnea and dry cough, bilateral nodular infiltrates and a 1.3-cm cavitary nodule on chest CT scan, and positive galactomannan antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

While the patient does not meet the criteria for definitive diagnosis of IPA, the presence of multiple risk factors and suggestive clinical features, along with a positive galactomannan antigen test, is highly suggestive of probable IPA. Therefore, the patient should be treated with antifungal therapy.

* A. The patient does not have proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The criteria for definitive diagnosis of IPA include positive galactomannan antigen in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, histopathologic evidence of invasive aspergillosis, or a positive culture for Aspergillus. The patient in this case does not meet these criteria.
* C. The patient does not meet criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The criteria for definitive diagnosis of IPA include positive galactomannan antigen in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, histopathologic evidence of invasive aspergillosis, or a positive culture for Aspergillus. The patient in this case does not meet these criteria.
* D. The patient is not at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the results reflect colonization. The patient is at high risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to his underlying granulomatous polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and mild pulmonary fibrosis. The results of the galactomannan antigen test are not consistent with colonization.

A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue from the body for examination under a microscope. This is the most accurate way to diagnose a skin lesion.

Hematoxylin-eosin stain is a type of staining that is used to color tissue samples. This staining helps to highlight the different structures in the tissue, which makes it easier for the pathologist to diagnose the lesion.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most accurate way to diagnose a skin lesion.

* **B. Obtain a biopsy for fungal culture:** A fungal culture is a test that is used to grow fungi in a laboratory. This test is used to diagnose fungal infections. However, a fungal infection is not the most likely diagnosis for a pink nodule on a child's cheek.
* **C. Treat with cryotherapy:** Cryotherapy is a treatment that uses extreme cold to destroy tissue. This treatment is used to treat a variety of skin conditions, including warts, moles, and skin tags. However, cryotherapy is not the most appropriate treatment for a pink nodule on a child's cheek.
* **D. Treat with pulsed dye laser therapy:** Pulsed dye laser therapy is a treatment that uses a laser to destroy tissue. This treatment is used to treat a variety of skin conditions, including birthmarks, hemangiomas, and port-wine stains. However, pulsed dye laser therapy is not the most appropriate treatment for a pink nodule on a child's cheek.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain.

 56%|█████▌    | 849/1525 [3:28:13<2:24:38, 12.84s/it]The correct answer is C: The patient may be using hydrocodone but is using cocaine.

The patient has a history of cocaine use, which is a risk factor for opioid misuse. She is also taking hydrocodone for chronic pain, which is a controlled substance. The urine immunoassay drug screen shows the presence of hydrocodone, but not cocaine. This could mean that the patient is taking hydrocodone as prescribed, but is also using cocaine recreationally. It is also possible that the patient is not taking hydrocodone as prescribed, and is using cocaine to get high.

The only way to know for sure whether the patient is using hydrocodone and cocaine is to do further testing, such as a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test. This test is more sensitive than the urine immunoassay test and can detect the presence of even small amounts of drugs.

If the patient is using hydrocodone and cocaine, it is important to address this issue. Opioid misuse and cocaine use can both have serious consequences, such as addiction, overdose, and death. The patient should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not take into account the patient's history of cocaine use and the fact that the urine immunoassay drug screen shows the presence of hydrocodone.

* Choice A is incorrect because the patient does have a history of cocaine use.
* Choice B is incorrect because the patient is taking hydrocodone, which is a controlled substance.
* Choice D is incorrect because the patient may not be using both hydrocodone and cocaine.

The patient has a history of ischemic stroke 10 years ago, which is a thrombotic event. He also has a recent history of right calf swelling and shortness of breath, which is suspicious for pulmonary embolism. These findings suggest that the patient may have a hypercoagulable state.

Antiphospholipid antibodies are antibodies that can bind to phospholipids, which are a type of fat found in the blood. These antibodies can increase the risk of thrombosis, or blood clots.

The patient's test results showed elevated levels of anticardiolipin and anti–β2 glycoprotein I antibodies. These are two types of antiphospholipid antibodies. However, it is important to note that these antibodies can also be found in people who do not have antiphospholipid syndrome.

To confirm the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, the patient's test results should be repeated in 12 weeks. If the results are still positive, then the patient may have antiphospholipid syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Results are sufficient to diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome. This is incorrect because the patient's test results are only suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome. A definitive diagnosis can only be made after the results have been repeated in 12 weeks.
* C. Results are uninterpretable due to heparin therapy. This is incorrect because heparin therapy does not affect the results of antiphospholipid antibody tests.
* D. Results are uninterpretable due to warfarin therapy. This is incorrect because warfarin therapy can affect the results of some blood tests, but it does not affect the results of antiphospholipid antibody tests.

 56%|█████▌    | 851/1525 [3:28:34<2:15:25, 12.06s/it]The correct diagnosis is carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when a tumor (usually in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs) produces excessive amounts of hormones called serotonin and other substances. These hormones can cause a variety of symptoms, including flushing, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and heart problems.

The patient in the case presented with several symptoms that are consistent with carcinoid syndrome, including flushing, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. The patient also has a history of a pulmonary tumor, which is the most common type of tumor that causes carcinoid syndrome. The CT scan showed multiple metastatic hepatic masses, which are also common in patients with carcinoid syndrome.

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness. The patient in the case does not have any of the characteristic skin lesions of leprosy.

Mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in the body. Mast cells are cells that release histamine and other substances in response to an allergic reaction. The patient in the case does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of mastocytosis, such as hives, itching, and flushing.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania. It is characterized by skin ulcers, fever, and weight loss. The patient in the case does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of leishmaniasis.

Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the skin that causes ring-shaped lesions. The lesions are typically scaly, erythematous, and pruritic. Tinea corporis is most commonly caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum. Treatment for tinea corporis includes topical antifungal medications, such as clotrimazole or terbinafine.

Duhring disease is a rare, chronic, autoimmune blistering skin disease. The lesions are typically small, flaccid pustules on an erythematous base. Duhring disease is most commonly seen in children and young adults. Treatment for Duhring disease includes oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone.

Psoriasis pustulosa is a severe form of psoriasis that is characterized by widespread pustules. Psoriasis pustulosa is most commonly seen in middle-aged and older adults. Treatment for psoriasis pustulosa includes systemic medications, such as methotrexate or acitretin.

The patient in the case presentation presents with multiple flaccid pustules on scaly, erythematous plaques on her trunk, with an annular and circinate pattern. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of IgA pemphigus. IgA pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering skin disease that is characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies at the subcorneal level. The lesions of IgA pemphigus are typically flaccid pustules that are easily ruptured. The lesions are often annular or circinate in shape. IgA pemphigus is most commonly seen in adults. Treatment for IgA pemphigus includes systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone.

The patient in the case presentation did not have any of the clinical features that are characteristic of tinea corporis, Duhring disease, or psoriasis pustulosa. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. IgA pemphigus.

 56%|█████▌    | 854/1525 [3:29:14<2:21:58, 12.69s/it]The correct answer is D. Herpes simplex virus.

The most common cause of neonatal herpes is herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), followed by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The risk of transmission is highest when the mother has a primary infection during pregnancy. Other risk factors include rupture of membranes for more than 4 hours, a low birth weight, and prematurity.

The most common clinical presentation of neonatal herpes is skin lesions, which are present in 70-80% of cases. The lesions typically start as small vesicles that become grouped and then ulcerate. They can be found anywhere on the body, but are most common on the face, scalp, and extremities. Other symptoms may include fever, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, and seizures.

The diagnosis of neonatal herpes is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is viral culture, but this can be difficult to obtain in neonates. Other tests that may be used include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, serologic testing, and skin biopsy.

The treatment of neonatal herpes is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. These medications are most effective if started early in the course of infection. The prognosis for neonates with herpes simplex virus infection depends on the severity of the infection. With early diagnosis and treatment, most neonates will have a good outcome. However, some neonates may develop serious complications, such as encephalitis, meningitis, or disseminated disease.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Candidiasis is a fungal infection that is often seen in neonates. The lesions of candidiasis are typically white or yellow and are surrounded by an erythematous halo. They are most common in the diaper area, but can also be found on the mouth, skin, and nails.
* Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is a benign skin condition that is seen in neonates. The lesions of transient neonatal pustular melanosis are small, pustular lesions that are found on the face, scalp, and trunk. They typically resolve spontaneously within a few weeks.
* Congenital varicella is a rare condition that occurs when a fetus is infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) during pregnancy. The most common clinical presentation of congenital varicella is skin lesions, which can be found anywhere on the body. Other symptoms may include fever, irritability, and lethargy. The prognosis for neonates with congenital varicella depends on the severity of the infection. With early diagnosis and treatment, most neonates will have a good outcome. However, some neonates may develop serious complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, or disseminated disease.

Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that typically presents with a sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the breast. It is often accompanied by skin redness, warmth, and swelling. The patient in this case did not have any of these clinical signs of inflammation or infection, making inflammatory breast cancer an unlikely diagnosis.

Tuberculous mastitis is a rare form of mastitis caused by infection with the tuberculosis bacterium. It is most common in women who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have undergone organ transplantation. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for tuberculosis, and her blood tests were negative for tuberculosis infection.

Mastitis caused by immunosuppression is a rare complication of immunosuppressive therapy, such as that used to treat cancer or autoimmune disorders. It is characterized by inflammation of the breast tissue, often with fever and chills. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for immunosuppression, and her blood tests were normal.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare inflammatory condition of the breast that is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of immune cells. The cause of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. The patient in this case had all of the classic features of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, including a sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the breast with edema and palpable axillary lymph nodes without clinical signs of inflammation or infection. Her blood tests were also consistent with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, as they showed no evidence of infection or immunosuppression.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are most consistent with this diagnosis.

 56%|█████▌    | 856/1525 [3:29:44<2:37:36, 14.14s/it]The correct answer is D. Unicentric Castleman disease.

Unicentric Castleman disease is a rare, non-neoplastic, lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by a proliferation of B lymphocytes. It is typically seen in middle-aged and older adults, and most often presents as a solitary mass in the abdomen, chest, or neck. Unicentric Castleman disease is often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of unicentric Castleman disease is made based on clinical findings, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies typically show a large, well-circumscribed mass that is hypervascular on contrast-enhanced CT scan. Laboratory tests may show an elevated white blood cell count, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an elevated C-reactive protein level.

The treatment of unicentric Castleman disease depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, treatment may consist of observation or surgery to remove the mass. In more advanced disease, treatment may include chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The prognosis for unicentric Castleman disease is generally good. With treatment, the majority of patients experience remission. However, the disease can recur in some patients.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case.

* Angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of endothelial cells. It is most commonly seen in the skin, but can also occur in the liver, heart, and other organs. Angiosarcoma typically presents as a rapidly growing mass that is often associated with bleeding and ulceration.

 56%|█████▌    | 857/1525 [3:30:00<2:43:54, 14.72s/it]The correct answer is C. Observe and repeat spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year.

The patient has Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and the eyes. In the eyes, Alport syndrome can cause a condition called pseudohole formation. Pseudohole formation is a condition in which the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, becomes distorted. This can cause blurred vision, distortion of images, and difficulty reading.

The patient in the case report has pseudohole formation in both eyes. The doctor has ordered a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan, which is a test that uses sound waves to create a detailed image of the retina. The OCT scan shows that the patient's pseudohole formation is stable and has not progressed in the past 6 months.

Based on this information, the doctor has decided to observe the patient and repeat the OCT scan in 6 months. This will allow the doctor to monitor the patient's condition and see if the pseudohole formation progresses. If it does, the doctor may need to take further action, such as performing a pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling.

A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. The internal limiting membrane is a thin membrane that covers the inside of the retina. In some cases, peeling the internal limiting membrane can help to improve vision in patients with pseudohole formation.

However, a pars plana vitrectomy is a major surgery with potential risks, such as infection and retinal detachment. Therefore, it is only recommended for patients who have severe pseudohole formation that is affecting their vision.

In the case of the patient in the case report, the doctor has decided to observe the patient and repeat the OCT scan in 6 months. This is a conservative approach that is unlikely to cause any harm to the patient. If the patient's pseudohole formation progresses, the doctor can then consider taking further action, such as performing a pars plana vitrectomy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, Perform pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling, is incorrect because the patient does not have severe pseudohole formation that is affecting their vision.
* Option B, Perform aqueous/vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction and inject foscarnet intravitreally, is incorrect because there is no evidence of infection in the patient's eyes.
* Option D, Perform intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin, is incorrect because ocriplasmin is a medication that is used to treat macular hole, a different condition than pseudohole formation.

 56%|█████▋    | 858/1525 [3:30:17<2:50:14, 15.31s/it]The correct answer is D. Start systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery. The patient's history and examination are consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that predominantly affects the medium- and large-sized arteries. GCA can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, fever, and weight loss. Visual symptoms, such as amaurosis fugax (fleeting blindness), are a common presenting feature of GCA and can be a harbinger of permanent visual loss.

The diagnosis of GCA is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are typically elevated in GCA. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not always necessary if the clinical suspicion is high.

Treatment of GCA consists of high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the arteries. The initial dose of prednisone is typically 1-2 mg/kg per day. The dose is then tapered over several weeks or months, depending on the response to treatment.

Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is often performed to confirm the diagnosis of GCA. The biopsy should be performed in the affected area, which is usually the temporal artery. The biopsy specimen is then examined under a microscope to look for characteristic findings of GCA, such as giant cells.

If GCA is not treated, it can lead to serious complications, such as blindness, stroke, and aortic dissection. Early diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroids can help to prevent these complications.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option A, observe and recommend smoking cessation, would not be appropriate in this case because the patient's symptoms are likely due to GCA, not smoking. Option B, obtain a hypercoagulable laboratory workup, would not be necessary in this case because the patient does not have any risk factors for a hypercoagulable disorder. Option C, perform diagnostic vitreous paracentesis and intravitreal antibiotic injection, would not be appropriate in this case because the patient does not have an infection in the eye.

 56%|█████▋    | 859/1525 [3:30:34<2:54:43, 15.74s/it]The correct answer is A: Observe and repeat imaging in 6 months.

The patient is a woman in her 40s with a circumscribed elevation of the right iris. She has no significant medical or family history, and review of symptoms is unremarkable. On examination, her corrected distance Snellen acuity is 20/20 OU, intraocular pressures are 12 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS, and slitlamp examination reveals a circumscribed elevation of the right iris inferotemporally. Her iris is uniformly pigmented, and gonioscopy reveals an iridocorneal angle open to scleral spur with a circumscribed area of iris insertion anterior to the Schwalbe line inferotemporally, not deepening on compression. Her lens is clear, and no iridociliary lesions are appreciated after pupillary dilation. The optic nerve and fundus appear normal. The left eye appears healthy with a uniformly deep anterior chamber.

The differential diagnosis for a circumscribed elevation of the iris includes iris cyst, iris nevus, iris melanoma, and ciliary body tumor. Iris cysts are the most common, followed by nevi. Iris melanomas are rare, but they are the most serious of these lesions. Ciliary body tumors are also rare, but they can be aggressive.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with an iris nevus. Iris nevi are benign lesions that are usually asymptomatic. They are often small, but they can grow larger over time. The most common treatment for an iris nevus is observation. If the nevus grows or changes in appearance, it may need to be removed.

The patient in this case has a small, asymptomatic iris nevus. There is no evidence of malignancy, and the patient is not at risk for vision loss. Therefore, the best management is to observe the nevus and repeat imaging in 6 months. If the nevus grows or changes in appearance, it can be removed at that time.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B: Lesion biopsy is not necessary in this case because the patient has a small, asymptomatic iris nevus. Biopsy is only indicated if there is concern for malignancy.
* C: Systemic workup for occult malignancy is not necessary in this case because the patient has no symptoms or signs of malignancy.
* D: Attempt lesion rupture with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser is not necessary in this case because the patient has a small, asymptomatic iris nevus. Rupture of the nevus could lead to inflammation and bleeding.

 56%|█████▋    | 860/1525 [3:30:51<2:57:52, 16.05s/it]The correct answer is A: Observe.

The patient has a history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessels. This can lead to a number of complications, including bleeding in the brain, eyes, and other organs. In this case, the patient has a fusiform heterogeneous peripherally enhancing extraconal mass within the superior orbit on the right, resulting in proptosis with downward displacement of the right globe. This suggests that the patient may have a cavernous hemangioma, which is a type of abnormal blood vessel that can grow in the orbit.

Cavernous hemangiomas are usually benign (noncancerous), but they can grow and cause problems, such as double vision, pain, and pressure in the eye. In some cases, they can also bleed.

The best course of treatment for a cavernous hemangioma is usually observation. This is because most cavernous hemangiomas do not grow or cause problems. However, if the hemangioma is growing or causing problems, surgery may be necessary to remove it.

In this case, the patient's double vision is likely due to the proptosis (bulging of the eye). The proptosis is likely due to the pressure of the hemangioma on the optic nerve. The patient's pain and pressure sensation in the right eye are also likely due to the pressure of the hemangioma on the optic nerve.

The patient's visual blur has resolved, but double vision persists. This suggests that the hemangioma is not growing or causing further damage to the optic nerve. However, it is important to continue to monitor the patient to see if the hemangioma grows or causes further problems.

If the patient's double vision becomes worse or if he develops other symptoms, such as decreased vision, pain, or pressure in the eye, he should be seen by a doctor right away.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the best course of treatment for a cavernous hemangioma.

* Canthotomy and cantholysis are surgical procedures that are used to widen the opening of the eye. They are not necessary for the treatment of a cavernous hemangioma.
* Fine-needle aspiration is a procedure in which a needle is used to remove a sample of tissue from a tumor. This procedure is not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of a cavernous hemangioma.
* Surgical drainage of the collection is a procedure in which a surgical incision is made to drain a collection of fluid. This procedure is not necessary for the treatment of a cavernous hemangioma.

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplant approximately 9 months prior. Her bone marrow transplant had been complicated with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of skin and liver, diagnosed by biopsies 1 month after her transplant.

The patient is now presenting with a new onset of bradycardia. The first-degree AV block that she had on her baseline ECG is a non-symptomatic, benign arrhythmia that is often seen in patients with GVHD. The new onset of bradycardia is likely due to an exacerbation of her GVHD.

The treatment for GVHD is to increase the dose of steroids and immunosuppressive medications. The patient is already receiving these medications, so the next step is to continue these treatments and observe her for improvement. If the bradycardia does not improve, then a pacemaker may be necessary. However, at this time, there is no indication that the patient needs a pacemaker.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Place a dual chamber pacemaker is incorrect because the patient does not have a symptomatic arrhythmia. A dual chamber pacemaker is only necessary for patients with symptomatic arrhythmias.
* Option C: Place an emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker is incorrect because the patient does not have a life-threatening arrhythmia. An emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker is only necessary for patients with life-threatening arrhythmias.

Rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor of skeletal muscle that typically occurs in children. It is the most common soft tissue tumor in the pediatric population. Rhabdomyomas are usually solitary and asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms if they grow large enough to compress surrounding structures. The most common symptoms of rhabdomyoma are respiratory distress, dysphagia, and voice changes.

Rhabdomyomas are typically diagnosed on imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI. The appearance of a rhabdomyoma on imaging studies is variable, but it is often described as a well-circumscribed, non-enhancing mass. Rhabdomyomas can also be diagnosed on biopsy. The characteristic histologic finding of a rhabdomyoma is the presence of cells with cross-striations, which are visible on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining.

Rhabdomyomas are typically treated with surgical excision. In most cases, surgical excision is curative. However, some rhabdomyomas can recur, and a small number of patients may develop metastatic disease.

Fusarium species infection is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but these are typically small and papular, not the large, edematous plaques seen in this case. Bartonella henselae infection is a bacterial infection that can cause cat scratch disease, which can also cause skin lesions. However, these lesions are typically small, red papules or nodules, not the large, edematous plaques seen in this case. Leukemia cutis is a skin manifestation of leukemia, which can cause skin lesions. However, these lesions are typically small, red papules or nodules, not the large, edematous plaques seen in this case.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and painful skin lesions.

 57%|█████▋    | 865/1525 [3:32:00<2:30:50, 13.71s/it]The correct answer is B. Evaluate for systemic vasculitis.

The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a risk factor for systemic vasculitis. The patient also has purpuric, erythematous macules coalescing into patches on the upper extremities, abdomen, and lower extremities, which are characteristic of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A skin punch biopsy showed extravasated erythrocytes, a neutrophilic infiltrate, fibrinoid necrosis, and broken-down neutrophils releasing nuclear debris, which are also consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

A second skin punch biopsy was performed for direct immunofluorescence, which was negative. This finding does not rule out the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis, as direct immunofluorescence is not always positive.

Results of a complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were unremarkable. These findings do not provide any additional information about the patient's condition.

Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step is to evaluate the patient for systemic vasculitis. This evaluation should include a review of systems, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. If systemic vasculitis is diagnosed, the patient should be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Prescribe prednisone is incorrect because the patient's condition has not been fully evaluated. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. However, in the absence of a diagnosis, it is not clear whether prednisone would be beneficial or harmful to the patient.

C. Prescribe a topical glucocorticoid is incorrect because the patient's condition is not localized to the skin. Topical glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammation of the skin. However, the patient's condition involves multiple organ systems, so a topical glucocorticoid would not be effective.

D. Provide reassurance and observe patient is incorrect because the patient's condition is potentially serious. Systemic vasculitis can lead to life-threatening complications, such as kidney failure, heart attack, and stroke. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the patient thoroughly and initiate treatment as soon as possible.

Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation of the skin, nail dystrophy, and corneal dystrophy. It is usually seen in adults and is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.

Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, and aplastic anemia. It is usually seen in children and is associated with an increased risk of cancer.

X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation of the skin, hypohidrosis, and sinopulmonary infections. It is usually seen in children and is associated with an increased risk of cancer.

The patient in the case presented with reticulate hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, and sinopulmonary infections. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder. The patient also has a family history of the disorder, which further supports the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis is not associated with hypohidrosis or sinopulmonary infections. Dowling-Degos disease is not associated with hypohidrosis. Dyskeratosis congenita is not associated with reticulate hyperpigmentation.

Lichen planus pigmentosus is a chronic skin condition that causes flat-topped, purple-red bumps on the skin. It is most commonly seen in adults, but it can also occur in children. The lesions are often itchy and can cause scarring. There is no cure for lichen planus pigmentosus, but treatment can help to relieve the symptoms.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that affects small blood vessels. It can cause inflammation and bleeding in the skin, joints, and other organs. Symptoms of leukocytoclastic vasculitis can vary depending on the affected organs. The most common symptoms are skin lesions, such as red, raised bumps or bruises. Other symptoms may include fever, joint pain, and fatigue.

Erythema dyschromicum perstans is a chronic skin condition that causes patches of discolored skin. The patches are usually brown or black and can be anywhere on the body. Erythema dyschromicum perstans is most common in people of African descent. The cause of erythema dyschromicum perstans is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no cure for erythema dyschromicum perstans, but treatment can help to improve the appearance of the skin.

The patient in the case presented with asymptomatic hyperpigmented lesions on her lower extremities. The lesions were symmetrically distributed and were not associated with any other symptoms. The physical examination revealed several 2-mm to 4-mm round, hyperpigmented macules symmetrically distributed over the lower extremities and dorsal feet. A skin biopsy was performed, which showed lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of macular lymphocytic arteritis.

Lichen planus pigmentosus, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and erythema dyschromicum perstans are all possible diagnoses for the patient's presentation. However, the findings on the skin biopsy are most consistent with a diagnosis of macular lymphocytic arteritis. Macular lymphocytic arteritis is a rare, chronic skin condition that is characterized by lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and are often found on the lower extremities. There is no cure for macular lymphocytic arteritis, but treatment can help to improve the appearance of the skin.

Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare, non-hereditary disorder characterized by the eruption of multiple yellow-brown papules on the skin. The lesions are typically found on the upper eyelids, infraorbital rims, bilateral axillae, inframammary creases, lower back, buttocks, hips, inguinal folds, and proximal thighs. The papules are often asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic or painful.

The underlying cause of xanthoma disseminatum is unknown, but it is thought to be a disorder of lipid metabolism. The lesions are composed of foamy histiocytes, which are cells that accumulate lipids.

Xanthoma disseminatum is typically diagnosed based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings. There is no specific treatment for xanthoma disseminatum, but the lesions may respond to treatment with corticosteroids, retinoids, or other medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Xanthogranuloma is a type of xanthoma that is characterized by the eruption of single or multiple yellow-brown papules or nodules. The lesions are typically found on the eyelids, face, scalp, and mucous membranes. Xanthogranuloma is most commonly associated with juvenile xanthogranuloma, which is a benign disorder of infancy and childhood.

 57%|█████▋    | 870/1525 [3:33:19<2:52:44, 15.82s/it]The correct answer is C. Mucocele of the appendix.

A mucocele is a cystic lesion of the appendix that is filled with mucus. It is caused by a blockage of the appendix, which can be caused by inflammation, infection, or a tumor. Mucoceles are usually benign, but they can rarely become cancerous.

The symptoms of a mucocele can vary depending on the size of the lesion. Small mucoceles may not cause any symptoms, but larger mucoceles can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

The diagnosis of a mucocele is usually made with a CT scan or MRI. Treatment for a mucocele depends on the size of the lesion and the symptoms. Small mucoceles that do not cause any symptoms may be monitored without treatment. Larger mucoceles or mucoceles that cause symptoms may be treated with surgery to remove the appendix.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's history and physical examination findings.

* Appendix abscess: An appendix abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the appendix. It is usually caused by infection. The patient would likely have a fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness in the right lower abdomen.
* Cecal carcinoma: Cecal carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. The patient would likely have abdominal pain, weight loss, and a change in bowel habits.

A. Tumor recurrence is incorrect because the patient had a Whipple procedure 2 years prior to presentation, and the tumor was not found to have recurred on imaging.

B. Marginal ulcer is incorrect because the patient did not have any risk factors for marginal ulcers, such as steroid use or a history of peptic ulcer disease. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings were not consistent with a marginal ulcer.

C. Afferent loop syndrome is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Afferent loop syndrome is a complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy that can occur when the afferent loop, which is the portion of the jejunum that is connected to the stomach, becomes obstructed. This obstruction can cause gastric distention, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of afferent loop syndrome is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings. Treatment of afferent loop syndrome may involve surgery to relieve the obstruction, or medical management with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications.

D. Internal hernia is incorrect because the patient did not have any risk factors for internal hernia, such as a history of abdominal surgery or a congenital defect. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings were not consistent with an internal hernia.

 57%|█████▋    | 872/1525 [3:33:47<2:39:43, 14.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform a biopsy of the lesion.

A time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, iris, lens, and anterior chamber angle. It can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including corneal edema, glaucoma, and anterior uveitis. However, it cannot be used to diagnose conjunctival lesions.

Observing the patient is not an appropriate management option for a patient with a conjunctival lesion. The lesion could be a sign of a serious condition, such as cancer, and it is important to obtain a diagnosis as soon as possible.

Obtaining a culture of the lesion is not an appropriate management option for a patient with a conjunctival lesion. A culture can be used to identify the bacteria or fungi that are causing an infection, but it cannot be used to diagnose a malignancy.

A biopsy of the lesion is the most appropriate management option for a patient with a conjunctival lesion. A biopsy will allow the doctor to determine the nature of the lesion and to develop a treatment plan.

The patient in the case presented has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. He also has a history of herpes simplex keratitis with fungal infection in the right eye that led to corneal perforation requiring penetrating keratoplasty. These factors increase his risk of developing cancer. The conjunctival lesion is a new finding and has not been noted on a routine examination 6 months prior. This suggests that the lesion may be malignant. A biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose the lesion and to determine the best course of treatment.

 57%|█████▋    | 873/1525 [3:33:58<2:26:35, 13.49s/it]The correct answer is D. Excisional biopsy.

A is incorrect because observation alone is not an adequate management for a patient with a known orbital mass. The patient in this case has a 6-month history of a gradually enlarging orbital mass, which is concerning for malignancy. Observation alone would not allow for definitive diagnosis or treatment of the mass.

B is incorrect because steroids and antibiotics are not indicated for a patient with a known orbital mass. Steroids may be used to treat inflammation in the orbit, but they would not be effective in treating a malignant mass. Antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of infection.

C is incorrect because fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not a reliable diagnostic test for orbital masses. FNAB may be used to obtain cells for cytologic analysis, but it is not always possible to obtain enough cells to make a definitive diagnosis. In addition, FNAB can potentially spread malignant cells if the mass is malignant.

D is the correct answer because excisional biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of orbital masses. Excisional biopsy allows for complete removal of the mass, which is the only way to ensure that the mass is benign. In addition, excisional biopsy allows for pathologic examination of the mass, which can provide information about the type of mass and its potential for recurrence.

In the case of the patient in this question, excisional biopsy is the best option for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the orbital mass. Excisional biopsy will allow for complete removal of the mass, which is the only way to ensure that the mass is benign. In addition, excisional biopsy will allow for pathologic examination of the mass, which can provide information about the type of mass and its potential for recurrence.

 57%|█████▋    | 874/1525 [3:34:14<2:34:57, 14.28s/it]The correct answer is C. Discuss the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy.

The patient in this case has bilateral macular lesions that are consistent with serpiginous choroiditis. Serpiginous choroiditis is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the choroid, the layer of tissue that nourishes the retina. The disease is characterized by the development of multiple, serpiginous (snake-like) lesions in the choroid. These lesions can lead to significant vision loss, particularly if they involve the macula, the central part of the retina that is responsible for sharp vision.

There is no cure for serpiginous choroiditis, but there are treatments that can help to control the inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. One of the most effective treatments is oral corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce the inflammation in the choroid. However, corticosteroids also have a number of potential side effects, including weight gain, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

Therefore, it is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits of oral corticosteroid therapy with the patient before starting treatment. The patient should be made aware of the potential side effects of the medication and the need to monitor their blood pressure and blood sugar levels. The patient should also be informed that oral corticosteroid therapy is not a cure for serpiginous choroiditis and that the disease may continue to progress despite treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Recommend multivitamin supplementation is incorrect because multivitamin supplementation is not an effective treatment for serpiginous choroiditis.
* Option B: Give an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection is incorrect because intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are not effective treatments for serpiginous choroiditis.
* Option D: Insist on observation for spontaneous resolution is incorrect because serpiginous choroiditis is a progressive disease and spontaneous resolution is not expected.

 57%|█████▋    | 875/1525 [3:34:31<2:41:50, 14.94s/it]The correct answer is A. Perform rapid plasma reagin and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with neurosyphilis, a late-stage complication of syphilis that can cause a variety of symptoms, including optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can lead to visual loss, which is often the presenting symptom of neurosyphilis.

The diagnosis of neurosyphilis is made by laboratory testing. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is a screening test for syphilis. The confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test is a more specific test for syphilis.

If the RPR test is positive, the FTA-ABS test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If the FTA-ABS test is positive, the patient should be treated with intravenous penicillin G.

Oral corticosteroids are not indicated in the treatment of neurosyphilis. Intravitreous tap and antiviral injection are not indicated in the treatment of neurosyphilis.

Observe is not a correct answer because the patient has a potentially serious condition that requires treatment.

 57%|█████▋    | 876/1525 [3:34:43<2:32:09, 14.07s/it]The correct answer is D. Give adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.

Adenosine is a medication that is used to treat supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVT is a type of fast heart rhythm that originates in the upper chambers of the heart. It is the most common type of tachycardia, and it can be caused by a number of things, including stress, caffeine, and alcohol.

Adenosine works by slowing down the electrical signals in the heart. This can help to stop the SVT and restore a normal heart rhythm. Adenosine is usually given as a rapid injection into a vein. It can cause some side effects, including flushing, chest pain, and shortness of breath. These side effects are usually mild and go away quickly.

In the case of the woman in the question, she is experiencing chest pain and dyspnea. These symptoms are consistent with SVT. The 12-lead electrocardiogram also shows wide complex tachycardia, which is a characteristic of SVT.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, perform direct current cardioversion followed by coronary angiography, is incorrect because the woman is not in ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is a life-threatening arrhythmia that requires immediate treatment. Direct current cardioversion is a procedure that uses an electric shock to stop the arrhythmia. It is the most effective treatment for ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not necessary in this case because the woman is not in ventricular tachycardia.
* Option B, give amiodarone for treatment of ventricular tachycardia, is incorrect for the same reason as option A. Amiodarone is a medication that is used to treat ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not necessary in this case because the woman is not in ventricular tachycardia.
* Option C, give procainamide for treatment of preexcited atrial fibrillation, is incorrect because the woman does not have preexcited atrial fibrillation. Preexcited atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia that is caused by a condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, there is an extra electrical pathway between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. This can cause a rapid heart rhythm. Procainamide is a medication that is used to treat preexcited atrial fibrillation. However, it is not necessary in this case because the woman does not have preexcited atrial fibrillation.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Give adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.

Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a condition in which the kidneys excrete too much calcium in the urine. This can lead to the formation of kidney stones. The exact cause of idiopathic hypercalciuria is unknown, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The patient in this case has several risk factors for idiopathic hypercalciuria, including a family history of kidney stones and a high intake of animal protein. The patient's 24-hour urine calcium level is also elevated, which is consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Treatment for idiopathic hypercalciuria is aimed at reducing the amount of calcium in the urine. This can be done by reducing dietary calcium intake, increasing fluid intake, and taking medications such as thiazides or potassium citrate.

A. The patient has hypercalciuria due to distal renal tubular acidosis.

Distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to properly regulate the acid-base balance of the blood. This can lead to hypercalciuria, as well as other symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and muscle cramps.

The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of RTA. Additionally, the patient's serum bicarbonate level is normal, which is inconsistent with the diagnosis of RTA.

B. The patient has hypercalciuria due to high animal protein intake.

A high intake of animal protein can increase the risk of kidney stones, as animal protein is a source of both calcium and oxalate. However, the patient in this case has a normal serum calcium level and a normal 24-hour urine oxalate level. Additionally, the patient's intake of animal protein is not excessive.

C. The patient has hypercalciuria due to high salt intake.

A high salt intake can increase the risk of kidney stones, as salt can increase the amount of calcium that is excreted in the urine. However, the patient in this case has a normal serum calcium level and a normal 24-hour urine calcium level. Additionally, the patient's salt intake is not excessive.

IMT is characterized by a storiform growth pattern of spindle cells, which are admixed with a lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor cells are positive for activin-like kinase-1 (ALK-1), which is a useful diagnostic marker.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Nodular fasciitis is a benign, reactive lesion that is often mistaken for a neoplasm. It is typically located in the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck. Nodular fasciitis is characterized by a haphazard proliferation of spindle cells, which are not admixed with a lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor cells are negative for ALK-1.
* Spindle cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm that can arise from a variety of tissues, including the skin, soft tissues, and gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells that are often arranged in a fascicular pattern. The tumor cells may be positive for ALK-1, but this is not a specific marker.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from skeletal muscle. It is typically diagnosed in children and young adults. Rhabdomyosarcoma is characterized by a proliferation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that have the potential to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells. The tumor cells are positive for desmin and myogenin, which are specific markers for skeletal muscle differentiation.

In summary, the correct diagnosis is inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. This is a rare, benign tumor that most commonly affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a storiform growth pattern of spindle cells, which are admixed with a lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor cells are positive for ALK-1, which is a useful diagnostic marker.

This is a rare type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the inside of the nose and sinuses. It is most common in people over the age of 50, and men are more likely to be affected than women. The exact cause of sinonasal mucosal melanoma is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The most common symptoms of sinonasal mucosal melanoma are nasal congestion, epistaxis (nosebleed), and facial pain. Other symptoms may include headache, facial numbness, and vision problems. If you experience any of these symptoms, it is important to see a doctor right away.

Sinonasal mucosal melanoma is a serious disease, but it is treatable. The type of treatment that is recommended will depend on the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.

The prognosis for patients with sinonasal mucosal melanoma depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. Overall, the five-year survival rate for this type of cancer is about 20%. However, with early diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate can be much higher.

Here are some details on why the other choices are incorrect:

* Leiomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the smooth muscle cells. It is most common in the muscles of the arms and legs, but it can also occur in the muscles of the head and neck. The symptoms of leiomyosarcoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor. However, some common symptoms include a mass, pain, and swelling. The treatment for leiomyosarcoma depends on the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.
* Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the olfactory epithelium, which is the tissue that lines the inside of the nose. It is most common in children and young adults. The symptoms of olfactory neuroblastoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. However, some common symptoms include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. The treatment for olfactory neuroblastoma depends on the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.
* Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the inside of the nose and sinuses. It is most common in people over the age of 50. The symptoms of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. However, some common symptoms include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. The treatment for sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the patient's overall health.

 58%|█████▊    | 882/1525 [3:36:16<2:48:40, 15.74s/it]The correct answer is A. Administer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) after consulting a hematologist.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is characterized by a high white blood cell count with a predominance of promyelocytes, which are immature white blood cells. Promyelocytes can release a substance called procoagulant factor Xa, which can lead to widespread clotting and bleeding.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a drug that is used to treat APL. ATRA works by causing the promyelocytes to mature into normal white blood cells. This reduces the risk of clotting and bleeding. ATRA is often given in combination with chemotherapy drugs such as cytarabine and daunorubicin.

The patient in the case should be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and treatment. The hematologist will likely order additional tests, such as a bone marrow biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis of APL. The hematologist will also discuss the risks and benefits of ATRA and chemotherapy with the patient.

Choice B, Administer cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy after consulting a hematologist, is incorrect because chemotherapy is not always necessary to treat APL. ATRA alone can be effective in many cases. Chemotherapy is often used in combination with ATRA when the disease is more advanced.

Choice C, Perform a bone marrow biopsy, is incorrect because a bone marrow biopsy is not always necessary to diagnose APL. A peripheral blood smear can often be used to make the diagnosis. However, a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the disease.

Choice D, Place a central venous catheter in preparation for replacing blood products, is incorrect because the patient does not have a bleeding disorder. Blood products are only needed in patients who have severe bleeding.

 58%|█████▊    | 883/1525 [3:36:27<2:35:33, 14.54s/it]The correct answer is B. Pheochromocytoma; proceed with imaging studies.

The patient's symptoms of chronic paroxysmal palpitations, flushing, a pale complexion, and diaphoresis are consistent with pheochromocytoma, a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Pheochromocytomas are often associated with hypertension, but the patient's blood pressure was normal. However, pheochromocytomas can also cause false-positive results on blood pressure tests, so it is important to consider other diagnostic tests.

The patient's laboratory tests showed elevated urinary metanephrines, which are metabolites of catecholamines. This is a highly specific test for pheochromocytoma.

The next step in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is to confirm the location of the tumor with imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging studies can also help to determine the size and extent of the tumor.

If the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is confirmed, the treatment is surgical removal of the tumor. This is usually a curative procedure.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer of the adrenal gland. It is not associated with the patient's symptoms.
* Aldosterone-producing adenoma is a benign tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes aldosterone. It is not associated with the patient's symptoms.
* False-positive results on metanephrine tests can occur in patients with other conditions such as anxiety, hyperthyroidism, and certain medications. It is important to repeat the test to confirm the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.

 58%|█████▊    | 884/1525 [3:36:43<2:40:30, 15.02s/it]The correct answer is C: Refer to an oral surgeon for excision.

The patient is a 24-year-old pregnant woman with a soft-tissue mass on her upper maxillary gingiva. The mass has been present for 2 to 3 weeks and is increasing in size. It is not painful but bleeds when she brushes her teeth or eats sharp foods, which makes it difficult to eat. There is no discharge from the area. She has no fevers, no trauma to the area, and no history of a similar condition.

The most likely diagnosis is a pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign tumor of the gums. Pyogenic granulomas are common in pregnant women and are thought to be caused by hormonal changes. They are usually self-limiting and resolve on their own within a few weeks or months. However, they can also become infected, which can lead to pain, bleeding, and swelling.

In this case, the patient's mass is large and is causing her pain and bleeding. It is also increasing in size, which suggests that it may not be self-limiting. Therefore, the best course of action is to refer her to an oral surgeon for excision. The oral surgeon will be able to remove the mass and ensure that it is completely removed. This will prevent the mass from becoming infected and will also prevent it from growing larger.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Prescribing a course of prednisone would not be effective in treating a pyogenic granuloma. A needle biopsy would not be necessary, as the diagnosis is already clear. Watchful waiting would not be appropriate, as the mass is large and is causing the patient pain and bleeding.

 58%|█████▊    | 885/1525 [3:36:59<2:43:04, 15.29s/it]The correct answer is C: Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a large adrenal mass that shows marked 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET/CT scan. This finding is highly suggestive of malignancy. The patient has no symptoms of hormone excess, but this does not rule out malignancy. The next step in management is to perform a surgical consult for adrenalectomy. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the mass.

A biopsy of the mass is not necessary in this case. The PET/CT scan findings are highly suggestive of malignancy, and a biopsy would not change management. In addition, a biopsy carries a risk of complications, such as bleeding and infection.

Ordering a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months is not an appropriate management option. The PET/CT scan findings are highly suggestive of malignancy, and a repeat CT scan is unlikely to provide any additional information. In addition, waiting 3-6 months could allow the tumor to grow and spread.

Performing adrenal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not an appropriate management option. The PET/CT scan findings are highly suggestive of malignancy, and an MRI is unlikely to provide any additional information. In addition, MRI is more expensive and time-consuming than CT scan.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with rat bite fever. He has a recent history of a rat bite, which is a risk factor for the disease. He also has a fever, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias, which are common symptoms of rat bite fever. The patient's skin findings are also consistent with the disease, as he has petechiae, purpura, and hemorrhagic vesicles. These lesions are typically found on the hands and feet, as they are in this patient.

Rocky mountain spotted fever is an infection caused by the Rickettsia rickettsii bacterium. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with Rocky mountain spotted fever. He does not have a history of tick exposure, and he does not have the characteristic rash of Rocky mountain spotted fever, which is a maculopapular rash that starts on the wrists and ankles and spreads to the trunk.

Septic emboli are blood clots that are infected with bacteria. They can occur as a complication of a number of infections, including pneumonia, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with septic emboli. He does not have a fever, and he does not have any evidence of infection in any other organ system.

Disseminated gonococcemia is a disseminated infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria. It can occur as a complication of untreated gonorrhea. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with disseminated gonococcemia. He does not have a history of gonorrhea, and he does not have the characteristic rash of disseminated gonococcemia, which is a pustular rash that starts on the palms and soles and spreads to the trunk.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and skin findings are most consistent with rat bite fever. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and signs.

 58%|█████▊    | 887/1525 [3:37:25<2:31:41, 14.27s/it]The correct answer is D. Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma.

Papillary/exophytic squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the nasal cavity. It is characterized by a raised, wart-like growth that bleeds easily. The patient in this case did not have any of the risk factors for papillary/exophytic squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or a history of chronic rhinosinusitis. Additionally, the biopsy specimen showed no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

Verruca vulgaris is a common skin condition that is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is characterized by a raised, wart-like growth that is usually found on the hands or feet. The patient in this case did not have any of the typical lesions of verruca vulgaris, and the biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of HPV.

Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous infection of the nasal mucosa that is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is characterized by a firm, indurated mass in the nasal cavity that can cause obstruction of the airway. The patient in this case did not have any of the typical symptoms of rhinoscleroma, and the biopsy specimen did not show any evidence of Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis.

Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schneiderian membrane, which is the lining of the nasal cavity. It is characterized by a raised, wart-like growth that bleeds easily. The patient in this case had all of the classic features of an exophytic Schneiderian papilloma, and the biopsy specimen showed no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D. Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma.

 58%|█████▊    | 888/1525 [3:37:42<2:38:15, 14.91s/it]The correct diagnosis is Majocchi granuloma, a rare cutaneous infection caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum. It is characterized by the formation of small, red, crusted papules and pustules that often have a linear or "sporotrichoid" distribution. The infection is most commonly seen in women, and it is often associated with tinea pedis (athlete's foot).

The patient in the case presentation is a woman in her 20s who developed a cutaneous eruption on her left leg 3 days after returning from a trout fishing trip in a freshwater lake. She recalled having a small abrasion on her left leg before wading waist-deep in search of trout. This history is consistent with a possible exposure to Trichophyton rubrum, which is a common fungus found in soil and water.

The patient's physical examination revealed erythematous, crusted, edematous plaques and pustules with weeping of yellow exudate on the left leg. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of Majocchi granuloma. The patient also had a palpable enlarged lymph node in the left groin, which is a common finding in patients with Majocchi granuloma.

The patient's laboratory work-up, potassium hydroxide scraping, and punch biopsies were all consistent with a diagnosis of Majocchi granuloma. The laboratory work-up showed an elevated white blood cell count, which is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in a variety of infections. The potassium hydroxide scraping showed the presence of fungal hyphae, which is a specific finding for Majocchi granuloma. The punch biopsy showed a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate, which is another specific finding for Majocchi granuloma.

The patient was treated with oral terbinafine, which is a medication that is effective against Trichophyton rubrum. The patient's symptoms improved after treatment, and she was discharged from the hospital after 1 week.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Bacterial folliculitis is a common skin infection that is caused by bacteria. It is characterized by the formation of small, red, pustules that are often located around hair follicles. The patient in the case presentation does not have any history of bacterial folliculitis, and her physical examination does not reveal any evidence of bacterial folliculitis.
* Mycobacterium marinum is a bacterium that can cause a skin infection called granulomatous pyoderma. It is characterized by the formation of large, deep, ulcers that often have a "punched-out" appearance. The patient in the case presentation does not have any evidence of granulomatous pyoderma.
* Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that is caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. It is characterized by the formation of small, red, nodules that often have a linear or "sporotrichoid" distribution. The patient in the case presentation does not have any evidence of sporotrichosis.

AGEP is a rare, self-limiting, febrile skin eruption that occurs predominantly in adults. It is characterized by the sudden onset of widespread erythematous macules and papules that rapidly evolve into sterile pustules. The pustules typically resolve within a few days to weeks, leaving no scarring.

The most common cause of AGEP is drug eruption, particularly with antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulfonamides. Other possible causes include infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancy.

The diagnosis of AGEP is based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. A skin biopsy may be helpful to rule out other possible diagnoses.

There is no specific treatment for AGEP. Treatment is supportive and includes rest, fluids, and antipyretics. In severe cases, systemic corticosteroids may be necessary.

The prognosis for AGEP is excellent. The vast majority of patients recover completely within a few weeks.

Here are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Pustular psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent episodes of erythematous plaques covered with pustules. It is a distinct entity from AGEP.
* Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including recurrent infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and skin lesions. It is not a common cause of AGEP.
* Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a serious, life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, irritability, and a widespread, tender, erythematous rash that rapidly evolves into flaccid bullae and desquamation. It is not a common cause of AGEP.

 58%|█████▊    | 890/1525 [3:38:11<2:39:05, 15.03s/it]The correct answer is C. Brown tumor.

A giant cell tumor is a benign bone tumor that is characterized by the presence of giant cells. It is the most common primary bone tumor of adults. Giant cell tumors typically occur in the long bones of the extremities, but can also occur in the pelvis, ribs, and skull. They are more common in women than men.

A giant cell reparative granuloma is a benign lesion that is similar to a giant cell tumor. However, it is not a true neoplasm, but rather a reactive lesion that occurs in response to trauma or inflammation. Giant cell reparative granulomas typically occur in children and young adults. They are more common in the hands and feet than in other bones.

A brown tumor is a benign lesion that is characterized by the accumulation of hemosiderin in the bone. It is most commonly seen in patients with hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. Brown tumors can also occur in patients with other conditions, such as Paget's disease of bone and multiple myeloma.

Metastatic lytic bone lesions are lesions that occur in the bone as a result of the spread of cancer from another organ. The most common cancers that metastasize to the bone are breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. Metastatic lytic bone lesions can cause pain, fractures, and other problems.

In the case of the 43-year-old woman in the question, the most likely diagnosis is a brown tumor. This is because she has a history of hyperparathyroidism, which is a known cause of brown tumors. She also has a number of other features that are consistent with a brown tumor, including an elevated calcium level and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. The other possible diagnoses are less likely because they do not explain all of the features of the patient's presentation.

 58%|█████▊    | 891/1525 [3:38:28<2:43:00, 15.43s/it]The correct answer is C. A recurrent herpetic whitlow.

A foreign body reaction is unlikely because the patient did not have any history of foreign body exposure. An osteitis is also unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms of bone infection, such as fever or chills. A bacterial cellulitis is also unlikely because the patient did not respond to antibiotic therapy.

A recurrent herpetic whitlow is the most likely diagnosis because the patient had a history of exposure to herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the virus that causes herpetic whitlow. The patient also had a classic presentation of herpetic whitlow, with a small, painful vesicle that progressed to a pustule and then to an abscess. The patient's symptoms resolved with treatment with antiviral medication.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. A foreign body reaction is unlikely because the patient did not have any history of foreign body exposure.

The patient in this case has bilateral decreased vision during pregnancy. Her medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes, which is well-controlled with insulin. Her blood pressure is 102/54, and her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/50 OD and 20/40 OS without afferent pupillary defect, motility disturbance, or intraocular pressure abnormalities. A fundus examination reveals bilateral hyperemic discs and macular edema and subretinal fluid, with numerous flame-shaped hemorrhages in 4 quadrants without microaneurysms, exudates, or neovascularization. There is no evidence of intraocular inflammation. Fluorescein angiography was deferred because of her pregnancy.

A complete blood cell count, antithrombin III, protein C, prothrombin mutation, antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin, diluted Russell viper venom test, and antinuclear antibody testing results were within normal limits. Her protein S level was decreased (61%) and factor V Leiden testing results revealed heterozygosity in the R506Q mutation.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with bilateral posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare, reversible neurological disorder that can occur in association with a number of medical conditions, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The underlying pathophysiology of PRES is thought to be vasogenic edema secondary to endothelial dysfunction.

The treatment of PRES is supportive and includes blood pressure control, seizure control, and reversal of the underlying cause. In some cases, anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent thromboembolic complications.

In this case, the patient should be referred to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation. The patient's protein S level is decreased, which is a risk factor for thromboembolic complications. In addition, the patient has a factor V Leiden mutation, which is a genetic predisposition to venous thromboembolism. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin is recommended for patients with PRES who have a risk of thromboembolic complications.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Perform an intravitreous injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is not indicated in this case. Anti-VEGF agents are used to treat retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, which are not present in this patient.
* Option C: Observe the patient is not an appropriate management option for this patient. The patient's vision is declining, and she is at risk for further vision loss.
* Option D: Perform panretinal photocoagulation in both eyes is not indicated in this case. Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, which is not present in this patient.

 59%|█████▊    | 893/1525 [3:38:57<2:39:27, 15.14s/it]The correct diagnosis is cholesterol granuloma. This is a benign lesion that is thought to arise from obstruction of the sinus ostium, leading to accumulation of cholesterol crystals and inflammatory cells. The lesion is typically seen in middle-aged adults and is more common in men than women. It can occur in any sinus, but is most common in the sphenoid sinus.

The clinical presentation of cholesterol granuloma is variable. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may present with headache, facial pain, or sinusitis. On examination, there may be tenderness over the involved sinus. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, typically show a well-circumscribed, expansile mass that does not enhance with contrast.

The treatment of cholesterol granuloma is surgical excision. This can be performed endoscopically or through an open approach. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients experiencing complete resolution of symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Mucocele: A mucocele is a benign, cystic lesion that is filled with mucus. It is most commonly seen in the frontal sinus. Mucoceles can cause symptoms such as headache, facial pain, and sinusitis. Treatment is surgical excision.
* Chondrosarcoma: A chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage. It is most commonly seen in the long bones, but can also occur in the head and neck. Chondrosarcomas can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and deformity. Treatment is surgical excision and radiation therapy.
* Chordoma: A chordoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the notochord. It is most commonly seen in the sacrum, but can also occur in the skull base. Chordomas can cause symptoms such as pain, cranial nerve palsies, and hydrocephalus. Treatment is surgical excision and radiation therapy.

Skull base osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone at the base of the skull. It is most commonly caused by bacteria, but can also be caused by viruses or fungi. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for skull base osteomyelitis, such as a recent head injury or dental infection. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with skull base osteomyelitis. Skull base osteomyelitis typically causes fever, headache, and facial pain. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

Chronic nonsuppurative otitis media is a chronic inflammation of the middle ear. It is most commonly caused by a build-up of fluid in the middle ear. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for chronic nonsuppurative otitis media, such as a recent upper respiratory infection. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with chronic nonsuppurative otitis media. Chronic nonsuppurative otitis media typically causes ear pain, hearing loss, and drainage from the ear. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone is a rare condition that affects the cells of the immune system. It is most commonly diagnosed in children. The patient in this case is an adult, so it is less likely that he has Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone. Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone typically causes hearing loss, facial paralysis, and vertigo. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. It is most commonly diagnosed in older adults. The patient in this case is an older adult, and he has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia can cause hearing loss, otorrhea, and facial nerve paralysis. The patient in this case has all of these symptoms.

The patient's biopsy specimen also supports the diagnosis of extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The biopsy specimen showed numerous, small, basophilic cells. These cells are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

 59%|█████▊    | 895/1525 [3:39:29<2:45:11, 15.73s/it]The correct answer is A. Intraosseous meningioma.

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, accounting for 23% of all intracranial tumors. They are usually benign, slow-growing tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Intraosseous meningiomas are a rare subtype of meningioma that arise within the bone. They are typically seen in middle-aged to older adults, with a female predominance. The most common presenting symptom is headache, followed by seizures, visual changes, and cranial nerve palsies. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for intraosseous meningiomas is generally good, with most patients experiencing long-term survival.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Mucoceles are benign, cystic lesions that can arise in any of the paranasal sinuses. They are typically caused by obstruction of the sinus ostium, which leads to accumulation of mucus and inflammation. Mucoceles typically present with symptoms of sinusitis, such as facial pain, headache, and nasal congestion. They are diagnosed with CT or MRI imaging. Treatment is typically with surgery to drain the cyst and open up the sinus ostium.
* Fibrous dysplasia is a non-cancerous bone disorder that can affect any bone in the body. It is characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. Fibrous dysplasia typically presents in childhood or adolescence with pain, swelling, and deformity of the affected bone. It is diagnosed with imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT, or MRI. Treatment is typically with surgery to remove the affected bone and replace it with a bone graft.
* Osteosarcoma is a cancerous tumor of the bone. It is the most common type of primary bone cancer in children and adolescents. Osteosarcoma typically presents with pain, swelling, and a mass in the affected bone. It is diagnosed with imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT, or MRI. Treatment is typically with surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

 59%|█████▉    | 896/1525 [3:39:46<2:46:57, 15.93s/it]The correct answer is A. Pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm is a bulge in an artery that forms when the wall of the artery is weakened and blood leaks out. This can happen due to trauma, infection, or a medical condition such as atherosclerosis.

The patient in this case presented with sudden onset of left-sided neck swelling, pain, and progressive respiratory distress. He reported a 2-day history of left-sided jaw pain preceding the swelling. These symptoms are consistent with a pseudoaneurysm.

On physical examination, the patient had trismus, rightward tracheal deviation, and a hoarse voice. Trismus is a tightening of the muscles of the jaw that makes it difficult to open the mouth. This can be caused by a mass in the neck that compresses the nerves that control the muscles of the jaw. Rightward tracheal deviation is a deviation of the trachea (windpipe) to the right. This can be caused by a mass in the neck that pushes on the trachea. A hoarse voice can be caused by a mass in the neck that compresses the nerves that control the vocal cords.

A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck showed a large hyperdense mass interposed between the left common carotid artery and the hypopharynx. The density of the mass was identical to that of the adjacent vasculature. This is consistent with a pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm can be treated with surgery, endovascular therapy, or conservative management. Surgery is the most common treatment for pseudoaneurysms. Endovascular therapy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a catheter into the artery and using it to close the aneurysm. Conservative management is sometimes used for small, stable pseudoaneurysms. This involves monitoring the patient and treating any symptoms that may develop.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A parapharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the parapharyngeal space, which is a space between the pharynx and the mandible. Parapharyngeal abscesses are most commonly caused by dental infections. They can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing.

A paraganglioma is a tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are found throughout the body. Paragangliomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck. They can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their location.

A venolymphatic malformation is a type of vascular malformation that involves abnormal connections between veins and lymphatic vessels. Venolymphatic malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck. They can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size and location.

 59%|█████▉    | 897/1525 [3:40:02<2:48:48, 16.13s/it]The correct answer is "Systemic antimicrobial treatment." The patient has acute and painless monocular vision loss, which is a classic presentation of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC). The patient also has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is a risk factor for ASPPC. The physical examination findings of bilateral lower leg swelling, a rash of the torso, painful “bumps” on his neck, reduced hearing abilities, and tinnitus are also consistent with ASPPC.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs that suggest a brain lesion. Serologic testing for syphilis is appropriate, but it will not provide any immediate treatment for the patient's vision loss. Chorioretinal biopsy is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of ASPPC can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and ophthalmologic examination findings.

Antimicrobial treatment with penicillin G is the most effective treatment for ASPPC. The patient should be treated for at least 10 days. The patient's vision loss should improve within a few weeks of treatment. However, the patient may have some permanent vision loss, depending on the severity of the initial infection.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs that suggest a brain lesion.
* Serologic testing for syphilis is appropriate, but it will not provide any immediate treatment for the patient's vision loss.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute pancreatitis, which is a common cause of bilateral retinal whitening. The characteristic findings on fluorescein angiography, including hypofluorescence in the areas of retinal whitening and nasal peripapillary hyperfluorescence, are also consistent with acute pancreatitis.

A lipase level is a sensitive and specific test for acute pancreatitis. A normal lipase level essentially rules out acute pancreatitis. An elevated lipase level, on the other hand, is highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

Ordering human immunodeficiency virus serologies, bacterial and fungal blood cultures, and antinuclear antibodies are not necessary in the evaluation of this patient. Human immunodeficiency virus serologies are not indicated in the absence of any risk factors for HIV infection. Bacterial and fungal blood cultures are not indicated in the absence of any fever or other signs of infection. Antinuclear antibodies are not indicated in the absence of any clinical features suggestive of an autoimmune disorder.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Order a lipase level.

 59%|█████▉    | 899/1525 [3:40:30<2:33:54, 14.75s/it]The correct answer is D. Schedule enucleation with orbital implant. The patient has a history of cutaneous melanoma, and the current lesion is a pigmented iris lesion with several satellite lesions. These findings are concerning for metastatic melanoma of the uvea. The goal of treatment for metastatic melanoma of the uvea is to preserve vision and quality of life. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been used to treat this condition, but they have not been shown to be effective in preventing metastasis or prolonging survival. Enucleation is the only treatment that has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma of the uvea. Enucleation involves removing the entire eye, including the globe, optic nerve, and muscles that control eye movement. An orbital implant is then placed in the empty socket to help maintain the shape of the face and prevent socket collapse.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not effective treatments for metastatic melanoma of the uvea. A transvitreal biopsy of the tumor would not be helpful, as it would not provide any information that would change the treatment plan. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have not been shown to be effective in preventing metastasis or prolonging survival in patients with metastatic melanoma of the uvea. Iridocyclectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing a portion of the iris and ciliary body. This procedure would not be effective in treating a metastatic melanoma of the uvea, as the tumor would have already spread beyond the iris and ciliary body.

 59%|█████▉    | 900/1525 [3:40:46<2:38:13, 15.19s/it]The correct answer is A. The patient is more likely to have a worse prognosis.

The patient has a 44-base pair (bp) internal tandem duplication in the FLT3 gene. This is a type of mutation that is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In particular, patients with FLT3 mutations are more likely to relapse after treatment and have a shorter overall survival.

The length of the duplication is not associated with prognosis in AML. In fact, a recent study found that patients with FLT3 mutations of any size had a worse prognosis than patients without FLT3 mutations.

The mutation burden is also not associated with prognosis in AML. In fact, a recent study found that patients with FLT3 mutations and a low mutation burden had a worse prognosis than patients with FLT3 mutations and a high mutation burden.

Therefore, the patient is more likely to have a worse prognosis because of the FLT3 mutation.

The other choices are incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because the length of the duplication is not associated with prognosis in AML.

Choice C is incorrect because the mutation burden is also not associated with prognosis in AML.

Choice D is incorrect because gene sequencing is not necessary to identify the FLT3 mutation. The FLT3 mutation can be detected with multigene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

 59%|█████▉    | 901/1525 [3:40:52<2:09:58, 12.50s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy sample.

The patient has a nonblanchable purpuric rash, which is a characteristic finding of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). HSP is a small vessel vasculitis that typically affects children, but it can also occur in adults. The most common presenting symptoms are purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement.

The diagnosis of HSP is made based on the clinical presentation and the findings on skin biopsy. The skin biopsy typically shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is characterized by a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of the skin biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis of HSP by demonstrating the deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and C3 in the walls of small blood vessels.

The treatment of HSP is generally supportive. Steroids may be used to treat severe cases, but they are not always necessary. In most cases, HSP resolves spontaneously within a few weeks to months.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Check serologies for hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, and streptococcal infections. These tests are not necessary in the diagnosis of HSP.
* B. Check antinuclear antibody (ANA). ANA is an antibody that can be found in the blood of people with a variety of autoimmune diseases. It is not specific for HSP and is not necessary for the diagnosis.
* D. Prescribe steroids with a slow and prolonged tapering regimen. Steroids may be used to treat severe cases of HSP, but they are not always necessary. In most cases, HSP resolves spontaneously within a few weeks to months.

She also has clinical features of MPN, including ascites, diffuse abdominal pain, and hepatic vein thrombosis. The laboratory workup shows an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as a JAK2 V617F mutation. The bone marrow biopsy shows increased numbers of myeloid precursors. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of MPN.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by hemolysis and thrombosis. It is caused by a mutation in the PIGA gene, which results in a deficiency of the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). GPI is essential for the attachment of proteins to the cell membrane, and its deficiency leads to hemolysis and thrombosis. PNH is not associated with obesity, smoking, oral contraceptive use, or MPN.

Hereditary protein C deficiency (APC deficiency) and hereditary antithrombin III deficiency (ATIII deficiency) are both inherited disorders that can lead to thrombosis. APC is a protein that helps to regulate blood clotting, and ATIII is a protein that helps to inactivate thrombin. Deficiencies in either of these proteins can lead to an increased risk of thrombosis. However, these disorders are not associated with obesity, smoking, oral contraceptive use, or MPN.

In conclusion, the patient in the case has a number of risk factors for MPN, including obesity, smoking, and oral contraceptive use. She also has clinical features of MPN, including ascites, diffuse abdominal pain, and hepatic vein thrombosis. The laboratory workup shows an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as a JAK2 V617F mutation. The bone marrow biopsy shows increased numbers of myeloid precursors.

Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is a rare, benign, inflammatory skin disease that typically presents as solitary or multiple, well-circumscribed, erythematous to violaceous papules or plaques on the extremities, especially the hands and feet. The lesions may be pruritic or painful. Histopathologic examination shows a granulomatous infiltrate with prominent giant cells and destruction of elastic fibers.

Granuloma annulare is a common, benign, inflammatory skin disease that typically presents as solitary or multiple, annular or arciform plaques on the hands, feet, and trunk. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Histopathologic examination shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with palisading of histiocytes at the periphery of the lesion.

Porokeratosis is a rare, chronic, autosomal dominant skin disease that typically presents as single or multiple, circumscribed, keratotic papules or plaques on sun-exposed skin. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Histopathologic examination shows a characteristic cornoid lamella at the base of the epidermis.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare, inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by fragile skin, easy bruising, joint hypermobility, and vascular fragility. The skin is typically thin, translucent, and easily bruised. The joints are hypermobile and may dislocate or subluxate. The vascular system is fragile and may rupture, leading to life-threatening bleeding. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a skin condition that is often seen in patients with vEDS. It is characterized by the development of small, brown papules that coalesce to form annular or serpiginous plaques. The lesions are typically located on the lower extremities. Histopathologic examination shows the presence of fragmented elastic fibers in the papillary dermis.

The patient in the case presented with multiple arciform to annular plaques on her extremities, favoring the antecubital and popliteal fossae. The plaques were asymptomatic and had been present since her adolescence. She was also easily bruised with minimal trauma since birth. There was no family history of similar cutaneous findings. The patient's skin was generally pale and translucent with visible veins, especially on the chest and abdomen. The face appeared to be emaciated, with a pinched nose, thin lips, sunken cheeks, and prominent eyes. A punch biopsy specimen from an individual papule from the left arm was obtained and analyzed under Verhoeff–van Gieson stain. The results showed the presence of fragmented elastic fibers in the papillary dermis.

The patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of vEDS with elastosis perforans serpiginosa. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

 59%|█████▉    | 904/1525 [3:41:37<2:26:05, 14.12s/it]The correct answer is B. Umbilical mucosal polyp.

The patient is an 8-month-old white male with a red, bleeding umbilical mass. The lesion has been present since loss of the umbilical stump at 1 week of life. It bled easily with Valsalva maneuver or trauma. The lesion was treated as an infantile hemangioma with timolol by an outside dermatologist and as an umbilical pyogenic granuloma with silver nitrate by the patient’s pediatrician, with minimal improvement.

On examination, the patient is an alert and healthy-appearing child. The umbilicus demonstrates a bright red, friable, 5-mm papule. A shave biopsy specimen was obtained for histologic examination.

The histologic examination shows an ulcerated epidermis, colonic mucosa, and granulation tissue. This finding is consistent with an umbilical mucosal polyp.

An umbilical mucosal polyp is a benign growth that arises from the lining of the umbilicus. It is usually caused by inflammation or infection of the umbilical stump. Umbilical mucosal polyps are most common in infants and young children. They are usually asymptomatic, but they may bleed or discharge mucus. Treatment is usually not necessary, but small polyps may be removed surgically.

Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the skin. It is usually caused by trauma or infection. Pyogenic granulomas are typically red, raised, and bleeding lesions. They may be painful or itchy. Treatment is usually not necessary, but pyogenic granulomas may be removed surgically or with laser therapy.

Umbilical hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents through the umbilical ring. It is caused by a weakness in the abdominal wall at the site of the umbilical cord. Umbilical hernias are common in infants and young children. Most umbilical hernias close on their own by the age of 5. However, some umbilical hernias may require surgery.

Patent urachus is a congenital anomaly in which the urachus, the tube that connects the bladder to the umbilicus, does not close properly after birth. This can allow urine to leak from the umbilicus. Patent urachus is usually diagnosed in infancy. Treatment is usually surgical.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Umbilical mucosal polyp. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

 59%|█████▉    | 905/1525 [3:41:49<2:18:45, 13.43s/it]The correct answer is C. Amyloidosis.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues, causing a variety of symptoms. The most common type of amyloidosis is primary amyloidosis, which is caused by the production of an abnormal protein called AL amyloid. AL amyloid can affect the heart, kidneys, liver, nerves, and other organs.

The patient in this case has a number of symptoms that are consistent with amyloidosis, including purpura (purple spots on the skin), ecchymoses (bruises), anorexia (loss of appetite), weight loss, anemia, abnormal liver function test results, renal impairment with moderate proteinuria, and a waxy yellow discoloration of the skin. The patient's serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis test results were normal, which suggests that the amyloidosis is not caused by a monoclonal gammopathy (a type of cancer). The patient's radiological studies were unremarkable, which means that there is no evidence of metastatic disease.

The punch biopsy specimen obtained from the patient shows the presence of amyloid deposits. Amyloid deposits are made up of abnormal proteins that form fibrils. These fibrils can be stained with Congo red, which causes them to turn apple green under polarized light. The presence of amyloid deposits in the biopsy specimen is diagnostic of amyloidosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. Myeloma can cause a variety of symptoms, including anemia, bone pain, kidney problems, and fatigue. However, myeloma does not typically cause the symptoms that the patient in this case is experiencing.
* Metastatic disease is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. Metastatic disease can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the organ or tissue that is affected. However, metastatic disease does not typically cause the symptoms that the patient in this case is experiencing.
* Leukemia cutis is a type of leukemia that affects the skin. Leukemia cutis can cause a variety of skin lesions, including purpura, ecchymoses, and nodules. However, leukemia cutis does not typically cause the other symptoms that the patient in this case is experiencing.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Amyloidosis. The patient's symptoms are consistent with amyloidosis, and the biopsy specimen shows the presence of amyloid deposits.

 59%|█████▉    | 906/1525 [3:42:03<2:21:46, 13.74s/it]The correct diagnosis is B. Mycotic meningomyelitis.

Tubercular meningomyelitis is an infection of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is a rare disease, but it is more common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV infection or cancer. The symptoms of tubercular meningomyelitis include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. The diagnosis is made by testing the cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Treatment is with antibiotics, such as isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

Neurosarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, including the central nervous system. The symptoms of neurosarcoidosis vary depending on the part of the central nervous system that is affected. Common symptoms include headache, seizures, vision problems, and numbness or weakness in the arms or legs. The diagnosis is made by testing the cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of granulomas, which are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Treatment is with corticosteroids, such as prednisone.

Central nervous system lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the central nervous system. The symptoms of central nervous system lymphoma vary depending on the part of the central nervous system that is affected. Common symptoms include headache, seizures, and weakness in the arms or legs. The diagnosis is made by a biopsy of the brain or spinal cord. Treatment is with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient in the case presented has a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of mycotic meningomyelitis. These include:

* Progressive quadriplegia, which is a characteristic symptom of mycotic meningomyelitis.
* Urinary retention, which is a common complication of spinal cord injury.
* A history of contact with moist earth, which is a risk factor for exposure to fungal infections.
* The presence of multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes, which can be a sign of disseminated infection.
* The results of the cerebrospinal fluid testing, which showed pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, and a decreased glucose level. These findings are consistent with an inflammatory process, such as that caused by a fungal infection.
* The results of the magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine, which showed multiple intramedullary lesions with enhancement. These lesions are characteristic of mycotic meningomyelitis.

In contrast, the patient does not have any features that are consistent with a diagnosis of tubercular meningomyelitis. These include:

* No history of tuberculosis.
* No immunosuppression.
* No fever or other systemic symptoms.
* No positive test results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the cerebrospinal fluid.

The patient also does not have any features that are consistent with a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. These include:

* No history of sarcoidosis.
* No systemic symptoms, such as fever or weight loss.
* No evidence of granulomas in the cerebrospinal fluid.

The patient also does not have any features that are consistent with a diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma. These include:

* No history of cancer.
* No systemic symptoms, such as fever or weight loss.
* No evidence of cancer cells in the cerebrospinal fluid.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented has a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of mycotic meningomyelitis. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

A herpes simplex virus infection is a viral infection that causes blisters on the skin, mouth, or genitals. It is not the correct answer because the patient's history does not include fever or other rashes, and the lesions are not associated with herpes simplex virus infection.

A mucocele is a small, fluid-filled sac that can develop on the gums, lips, or inside of the cheeks. It is not the correct answer because the patient's lesions are not filled with fluid.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on the nerves. It is not the correct answer because the patient's history does not include any other signs or symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1.

An oral lymphangioma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that grows from the lymphatic system. It is the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with an oral lymphangioma. The lesions are described as being pale, nontender papules that are distributed over the anterior third of the tongue. This is the typical appearance of an oral lymphangioma. Additionally, the patient has a history of recurrent lesions that develop and resolve spontaneously over the course of days to weeks. This is also consistent with the clinical course of an oral lymphangioma.

 60%|█████▉    | 908/1525 [3:42:35<2:33:33, 14.93s/it]The correct answer is C. Sigmoid volvulus.

A sigmoid volvulus is a twisting of the sigmoid colon, which is the lower part of the large intestine. It is a type of large bowel obstruction.

The most common symptoms of sigmoid volvulus are abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation. The pain is usually severe and comes on suddenly. The distention is caused by the blockage of the bowel. The constipation is caused by the inability of the stool to pass through the blocked bowel.

The diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus is made with a physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies. The physical examination may reveal abdominal tenderness and distention. The blood tests may reveal an elevated white blood cell count, which is a sign of infection. The imaging studies, such as a CT scan or an X-ray, may show the twisted sigmoid colon.

The treatment of sigmoid volvulus is usually surgical. The goal of surgery is to untwist the sigmoid colon and relieve the obstruction. In some cases, the sigmoid colon may need to be removed.

The prognosis for sigmoid volvulus is good if it is treated promptly. However, if it is not treated, it can lead to serious complications, such as perforation of the bowel, sepsis, and death.

Aerophagia is the excessive swallowing of air. It is a common condition that can cause abdominal distention, belching, and flatulence. It is not a cause of large bowel obstruction.

Colonic ileus/colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) is a condition in which the large intestine stops working properly. It is a rare condition that can be caused by a number of factors, such as surgery, medications, and underlying medical conditions. It is not a cause of sigmoid volvulus.

 60%|█████▉    | 909/1525 [3:42:50<2:33:10, 14.92s/it]The correct answer is C. Phytobezoar.

A phytobezoar is a mass of undigested plant material that forms in the stomach or small intestine. It is most commonly seen in people with conditions that slow down the passage of food through the digestive system, such as gastroparesis, Crohn's disease, and scleroderma. Phytobezoars can also form in people who eat a lot of fiber-rich foods, such as beans, nuts, and seeds.

The symptoms of a phytobezoar can vary depending on its size and location. Small bezoars may not cause any symptoms, but larger bezoars can block the passage of food and cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. In rare cases, a phytobezoar can rupture the small intestine, causing peritonitis.

The diagnosis of a phytobezoar is usually made with a CT scan or abdominal X-ray. Treatment may involve removing the bezoar with endoscopy or surgery. In some cases, a medication called metoclopramide may be used to help move the bezoar through the digestive system.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic lung cancer is a cancer that has spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. It is unlikely that a patient with metastatic lung cancer would present with the symptoms described in the case.
* Small-bowel intussusception is a condition in which a segment of the small intestine telescopes into itself, causing blockage. It is more common in children than in adults.
* Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause pain, infertility, and other problems. However, it is not a common cause of small-bowel obstruction.

 60%|█████▉    | 910/1525 [3:43:05<2:33:30, 14.98s/it]The correct answer is B. Transposition of the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta.

The patient has a history of hypertension and presents with irregular heartbeats, premature ventricular contractions, and a medium-sized area of moderate stress-induced ischemia throughout the right coronary artery (RCA) territory. The cardiac catheterization shows retrograde filling of the RCA emptying into the main pulmonary artery. This indicates that the RCA is originating from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta, a condition known as anomalous origin of the RCA from the pulmonary artery (AORCA).

AORCA is a rare congenital heart defect that occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 live births. It is more common in males than females. The severity of AORCA varies depending on the length of the anomalous vessel and the presence of other associated cardiac defects.

The most common symptoms of AORCA are chest pain, palpitations, and syncope. These symptoms are caused by ischemia and infarction of the right ventricle and right atrium. In some cases, AORCA can lead to sudden cardiac death.

The treatment for AORCA is surgical correction. The goal of surgery is to redirect the RCA to the aorta. This can be done by anastomosis, which is the surgical joining of two blood vessels, or by translocation, which is the surgical transfer of the RCA from one location to another.

Anastomosis is the preferred method of treatment for AORCA. It is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed with minimal risk. Translocation is a more complex procedure that is associated with a higher risk of complications. However, it may be the only option for patients with short anomalous vessels or other associated cardiac defects.

In the case of the 67-year-old man with AORCA, the correct treatment is transposition of the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. This is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed with minimal risk. It will redirect the RCA to the aorta and restore normal blood flow to the right ventricle and right atrium. This will improve the patient's symptoms and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Medical therapy with β-blockers, nifedipine, long-acting nitrates, and flecainide acetate may be used to control the patient's symptoms, but they will not cure the AORCA. Left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery and percutaneous coronary intervention of the total RCA occlusion are both procedures that are used to treat coronary artery disease. However, they are not appropriate for the patient with AORCA because the RCA is not originating from the aorta.

 60%|█████▉    | 911/1525 [3:43:18<2:26:49, 14.35s/it]The correct answer is C. The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).

The direct LDL-C level is measured directly, while the calculated LDL-C level is calculated using a formula that takes into account the total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides. The formula is not accurate in all cases, and can be inaccurate in people with high levels of VLDL, IDL, and/or Lp(a).

In this case, the patient has a high level of Lp(a), which is a lipoprotein that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The Lp(a) is not included in the formula used to calculate LDL-C, so the calculated LDL-C level is lower than the direct LDL-C level.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A laboratory error is unlikely, as the direct LDL-C level was measured on two different occasions and was consistent with the patient's high Lp(a) level. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by high levels of VLDL and IDL. The patient does not have any of the symptoms of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, so it is unlikely that he has this condition. The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is not the result of excess VLDL cholesterol only, as the patient also has high levels of IDL and Lp(a).

 60%|█████▉    | 912/1525 [3:43:33<2:26:07, 14.30s/it]The correct answer is C. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the peripheral nerves. It is typically a spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for BCL2 protein and neural marker, S-100 protein. However, it does not typically show focal immunoreactivity for smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35. In addition, MPNSTs are typically highly mitotic and have a high rate of tumoral necrosis. The patient in this case did not have any of these features, making MPNST an unlikely diagnosis.

Monophasic synovial sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that typically arises from the synovium of joints. It is a spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for CD34 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). However, it does not typically show focal immunoreactivity for smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35. In addition, monophasic synovial sarcomas are typically highly mitotic and have a high rate of tumoral necrosis. The patient in this case did not have any of these features, making monophasic synovial sarcoma an unlikely diagnosis.

Glomus tumor is a rare, benign tumor that typically arises from the glomus body, a small vascular structure located in the skin. It is a spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin. However, it does not typically show focal immunoreactivity for S-100 protein. In addition, glomus tumors are typically non-infiltrative and do not have a high rate of metastasis. The patient in this case had a large, infiltrative mass with a high risk of metastasis, making glomus tumor an unlikely diagnosis.

Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that typically arises from the sinonasal mucosa. It is a spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for BCL2 protein, S-100 protein, and smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35. It is also typically non-infiltrative and has a low rate of metastasis. The patient in this case had a large, infiltrative mass with a high risk of metastasis, but the tumor also showed immunoreactivity for BCL2 protein, S-100 protein, and smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35, making biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma the most likely diagnosis.

 60%|█████▉    | 913/1525 [3:43:49<2:32:09, 14.92s/it]The correct answer is A. Plasmacytoma.

A plasmacytoma is a type of cancer that starts in plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. Plasmacytomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the bones.

The patient in the case presented with mild to moderate trismus and swelling on the left side of the face of a few months’ duration. Her medical history was significant for herpes zoster and self-limited vertigo approximately 3 years prior. Her physical examination was remarkable for left-sided facial swelling. No deficits of the facial or trigeminal nerves were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed a mass lying on the anterior surface of the eroded left mandibular condyle with homogeneous isointensity relative to skeletal muscle. Postcontrast T1-weighted image with fat suppression showed homogeneous, avid enhancement of the mass. T2-weighted image showed homogeneous moderately hyperintense signal. Diffusion-weighted image is significant for marked diffusion restriction.

These findings are consistent with a plasmacytoma. Plasmacytomas are typically solitary lesions, but they can also be multiple. They are often associated with multiple myeloma, a disease in which plasma cells multiply abnormally in the bone marrow.

The treatment of plasmacytoma depends on the stage of the disease. Solitary plasmacytomas can be treated with radiation therapy or surgery. Multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation.

The prognosis for plasmacytoma is variable. Solitary plasmacytomas have a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of over 90%. Multiple myeloma has a poorer prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of around 50%.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Ameloblastoma is a benign tumor that arises from the tooth-forming cells. It is most common in the mandible, but it can also occur in the maxilla. Ameloblastomas are typically slow-growing and non-aggressive.
* Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from bone-forming cells. It is the most common primary bone cancer in adults. Osteosarcomas are typically aggressive tumors that can spread to other parts of the body.
* Venous malformation is a congenital abnormality of the veins. It is a collection of abnormal veins that can occur anywhere in the body. Venous malformations are typically benign tumors that do not cause any symptoms.

Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common type of parotid tumor, but it is not typically associated with a slowly enlarging neck mass. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a more aggressive type of tumor that is also not typically associated with a slowly enlarging neck mass. HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cyst is a rare condition that is not typically associated with a slowly enlarging neck mass.

Acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is characterized by the presence of acinar cells. Acinar cells are cells that produce saliva. Acinic cell carcinoma is usually a slow-growing tumor that is often diagnosed at an early stage. The treatment for acinic cell carcinoma usually involves surgery to remove the tumor.

The patient in the case presented with a slowly enlarging, nontender, left-sided neck mass at the angle of the mandible that had been present for 4 years. Fine-needle aspiration was performed twice, each time with inconclusive results. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed a heterogeneous mass located immediately adjacent to the tail of the left parotid. No other masses were noted. He underwent a left superficial parotidectomy with en bloc removal of the mass. Pathologic findings revealed a 3.0 × 2.9 × 1.9-cm, encapsulated, tan, soft nodule within the specimen. The nodule had peripheral cystic spaces as well as focal areas of hemorrhage and a 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.4-cm area of calcification within the periphery. The entire tumor was confined within a periparotid lymph node, almost completely replacing it. Histopathologic findings (Figure) showed a mixture of dark, granular, basophilic acinar cells and eosinophilic intercalated ductal cells. The acinar cells contained periodic acid–Schiff–positive, diastase–resistant intracytoplasmic granules, whereas the ductal cells were both fusiform and cuboidal forming small ductlike structures. The neoplasm also exhibited focal areas of hyaline sclerosis without necrosis.

The findings of the case are consistent with a diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. The patient's history of a slowly enlarging neck mass, the presence of a heterogeneous mass on CT scan, and the histopathologic findings of a mixture of acinar cells and ductal cells are all characteristic of acinic cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history and physical findings. Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is characterized by the presence of a variety of cell types, including acinar cells, ductal cells, and myoepithelial cells. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is characterized by the presence of mucus-producing cells and squamous cells. HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cyst is a rare condition that is characterized by the enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck.

 60%|██████    | 915/1525 [3:44:22<2:39:56, 15.73s/it]The correct answer is B. Rhabdomyosarcoma.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the muscles. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. Rhabdomyosarcoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the head and neck, arms, legs, and bladder.

The symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma can vary depending on where the cancer starts. In the case of the patient in the case study, the symptoms include blurred vision, right eye pain, right ear pain, right eye swelling, forehead tenderness, right eye proptosis, and restricted eye movement. These symptoms are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma because they are all caused by a mass in the right anterior nasal cavity that is invading the right orbit.

The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma is made with a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the body and examined under a microscope. The biopsy can determine the type of cancer and the stage of the cancer.

The treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma depends on the stage of the cancer. In early-stage rhabdomyosarcoma, the cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In later-stage rhabdomyosarcoma, the cancer may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and stem cell transplantation.

The prognosis for rhabdomyosarcoma depends on the stage of the cancer. The overall survival rate for children with rhabdomyosarcoma is 70%. The survival rate for children with rhabdomyosarcoma that has spread to other parts of the body is 50%.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms as well as rhabdomyosarcoma does.

A. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the olfactory epithelium, which is the tissue that lines the nose. Esthesioneuroblastoma is most common in adults in their 30s and 40s. The symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nasal obstruction, headache, facial pain, and anosmia (loss of smell).

C. Ethmoid mucocele is a noncancerous growth that occurs in the ethmoid sinus. The ethmoid sinus is one of the four pairs of sinuses that are located in the skull. Ethmoid mucoceles are most common in adults in their 50s and 60s. The symptoms of ethmoid mucocele include nasal obstruction, headache, facial pain, and double vision.

D. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the lining of the nose and sinuses. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is most common in adults in their 50s and 60s. The symptoms of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma include nasal obstruction, headache, facial pain, and bleeding from the nose.

 60%|██████    | 916/1525 [3:44:38<2:41:57, 15.96s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis.

The patient is a young woman with a 2-month history of frequent headaches and 1 week of blurry vision in her left eye. She has a history of systemic hypertension, depression, and obesity. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and fluoxetine. On review of systems, she endorses nausea as well as paresthesia in her hands.

The patient's examination is significant for bilateral optic disc swelling (Frisén grade 2 in each eye) as well as unilateral macular exudates, subretinal fluid, and subretinal hemorrhages in the left eye. Results from brain magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance venography with and without contrast were normal.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, and pseudotumor cerebri. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause sudden vision loss. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease that can affect the optic nerve, brain, and spinal cord. Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a known cause.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis. A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF is then analyzed for signs of infection, inflammation, or bleeding. The opening pressure is the pressure of the CSF when it is first released from the spinal canal. An elevated opening pressure is a characteristic finding in pseudotumor cerebri.

If the results of the lumbar puncture are normal, the patient may be diagnosed with optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is typically treated with corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. If the patient has multiple sclerosis, she may be treated with disease-modifying therapies, which can help to slow the progression of the disease. If the patient has pseudotumor cerebri, she may be treated with medications to reduce intracranial pressure, such as acetazolamide or furosemide.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Observe the patient and treat headaches conservatively is incorrect because the patient has significant visual changes and an abnormal fundus examination. These findings suggest that the patient has a serious underlying condition that requires further evaluation.
* Option B: Consult surgery for immediate surgical intervention is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms that require immediate surgery.
* Option D: Begin treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is incorrect because the patient's diagnosis is not yet known. Corticosteroids are a powerful medication that can have serious side effects, so they should only be used after a diagnosis has been made.

 60%|██████    | 917/1525 [3:44:55<2:43:08, 16.10s/it]The correct answer is B. Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion.

The patient in the case presented with atypical corneal deposits of the right eye. The deposits were located in the superior cornea and were associated with mild stromal thinning and pannus. There were no other abnormalities reported on examination. The patient was treated conservatively with lubrication.

One year later, the patient's best-corrected visual acuity had decreased to 20/30 OD with against-the-rule astigmatism. There was progressive corneal thinning and a dense, serpentine network of subepithelial deposits with adjacent neovascularization in the superior cornea, extending toward the visual axis.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's condition includes a number of corneal dystrophies, such as granular dystrophy, lattice dystrophy, and map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy. However, the most likely diagnosis is Terrien's marginal degeneration. Terrien's marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory, degenerative condition of the peripheral cornea that typically affects middle-aged and older men. The condition is characterized by the development of subepithelial deposits and pannus in the peripheral cornea. The deposits may eventually extend to the visual axis, causing visual impairment.

The treatment of Terrien's marginal degeneration is aimed at preventing the progression of the disease and preserving vision. Treatment options include topical steroids, lubricants, and bandage contact lenses. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the subepithelial deposits and improve vision.

In the case presented, the patient's best-corrected visual acuity has decreased significantly. The patient also has progressive corneal thinning and neovascularization. These findings suggest that the patient's condition is progressing and that further treatment is necessary.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is a thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion. This will allow the physician to assess the extent of the disease and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The physician may also perform a corneal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of Terrien's marginal degeneration.

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this case. Crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that is used to treat certain corneal dystrophies. However, this procedure is not indicated for Terrien's marginal degeneration. Subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication is a treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. However, this treatment is not indicated for Terrien's marginal degeneration. Refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting is a treatment option for patients with astigmatism. However, this treatment is not indicated for Terrien's marginal degeneration.

 60%|██████    | 918/1525 [3:45:08<2:33:36, 15.18s/it]Option A is incorrect because it would be premature to recommend an alternative to zoledronic acid without first re-challenging the patient with the drug. The patient's uveitis may have been a transient reaction to the initial dose of zoledronic acid, and it is possible that he would not experience any problems if he were to receive the drug again.

Option B is the correct answer because it is the most conservative approach. Re-challenging the patient with zoledronic acid will allow the physician to determine whether the uveitis was truly a drug reaction or if there is another underlying cause. If the uveitis does recur, the physician can then take steps to manage it.

Option C is incorrect because it would be unnecessarily aggressive. There is no evidence that the patient would benefit from preemptive treatment with steroids before his next dose of zoledronic acid.

Option D is incorrect because it is not supported by the evidence. The patient's uveitis is most likely related to his treatment with zoledronic acid, and there is no reason to believe that it is an unrelated idiopathic uveitis.

 60%|██████    | 919/1525 [3:45:19<2:21:20, 13.99s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform aggressive debridement of the eyelids in the operating room and give intravenous antibiotics.

The patient has a clinical picture consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening infection of the skin and underlying soft tissues. Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by a group of bacteria that can quickly spread through the body, causing extensive tissue damage and death.

The initial treatment for necrotizing fasciitis is aggressive debridement of the affected tissue. This involves removing all of the dead and infected tissue, which can help to stop the spread of the infection. Debridement is usually performed in the operating room under general anesthesia.

In addition to debridement, patients with necrotizing fasciitis also need to be treated with intravenous antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics will depend on the specific bacteria that are causing the infection.

Patients with necrotizing fasciitis typically require hospitalization for several days or weeks. The length of hospitalization will depend on the severity of the infection and the patient's response to treatment.

The prognosis for patients with necrotizing fasciitis varies depending on the severity of the infection. With prompt and aggressive treatment, most patients will survive. However, some patients may have long-term complications, such as scarring, nerve damage, and amputation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Begin oral antibiotics and discharge home with follow-up the next day is incorrect because the patient has a life-threatening infection that requires hospitalization and aggressive treatment.
* Answer B: Admit for intravenous antibiotics is incorrect because the patient also needs to undergo debridement of the affected tissue.
* Answer C: Perform bedside incision and drainage of the blisters and admit for intravenous antibiotics is incorrect because the patient needs to undergo more extensive debridement in the operating room.

 60%|██████    | 920/1525 [3:45:31<2:15:35, 13.45s/it]The correct answer is C: Osteosarcoma metastasis.

The patient's history of high-grade osteosarcoma with areas of leimyosarcoma of the tibia, which had been treated with right above-knee amputation and chemotherapy 4 years prior to presentation, is a strong risk factor for osteosarcoma metastasis. The patient also has a palpable nontender, firm mass in the left neck, which is a common presentation for osteosarcoma metastasis. The CT scan of the neck reveals a 6.0 × 3.4 × 4.4-cm calcified left thyroid lobe mass, which is also consistent with osteosarcoma metastasis. The PET-CT imaging shows increased uptake in the left thyroid gland, which is another finding that is consistent with osteosarcoma metastasis. The neoplastic cells were positive for p53, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for S-100, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and CD34. These findings are also consistent with osteosarcoma metastasis.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Thyroid lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland. It is not a common metastasis site for osteosarcoma.
* Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of thyroid cancer. It is not a common metastasis site for osteosarcoma.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can affect the skin, the cervix, and other organs. It is not a common metastasis site for osteosarcoma.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Osteosarcoma metastasis. The patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory findings are all consistent with osteosarcoma metastasis.

 60%|██████    | 921/1525 [3:45:47<2:23:51, 14.29s/it]The correct answer is C. Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

The infant's rash is consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE), which is an autoimmune disorder that can occur in infants born to mothers with certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). NLE can cause a variety of symptoms, including rash, fever, anemia, and heart problems.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are antibodies that can be found in the blood of people with SLE and other autoimmune diseases. Testing for ANAs is a common way to screen for NLE. If the infant's ANA test is positive, additional testing, such as testing for anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies, may be done to confirm the diagnosis of NLE.

Anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies are antibodies that are found in the blood of people with SLE and other autoimmune diseases. These antibodies can cross the placenta and affect the fetus during pregnancy. In some cases, anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies can cause the fetus to develop NLE.

If the infant's ANA test is positive and the infant also has anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies, the infant is at increased risk for developing certain complications, such as heart problems and anemia. These complications can be treated, but it is important to diagnose NLE early so that treatment can be started.

Treatment for NLE depends on the symptoms and the severity of the disease. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. In other cases, treatment may include medications to suppress the immune system, such as steroids.

The infant's mother should also be tested for ANAs, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. If the mother has these antibodies, she is at increased risk for developing SLE or other autoimmune diseases. She should also be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of these diseases.

A. Provide education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing is not the correct answer because the infant's rash is not caused by poor hygiene.

B. Administer topical antifungals is not the correct answer because the infant's rash is not caused by a fungal infection.

D. Order a serologic test for syphilis for the infant is not the correct answer because the infant's rash is not caused by syphilis.

 60%|██████    | 922/1525 [3:46:04<2:30:54, 15.02s/it]The correct answer is C. Cutaneous malakoplakia.

Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare, benign, inflammatory skin condition characterized by yellow-brown papules or plaques. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic renal failure, but can also occur in patients with other conditions such as hematologic malignancies, immunosuppression, and AIDS. The lesions are thought to be caused by the accumulation of macrophages that have phagocytosed bacteria, particularly _Klebsiella pneumoniae_.

The diagnosis of cutaneous malakoplakia is made by biopsy. The characteristic histopathologic findings include the presence of macrophages with large, foamy cytoplasm containing Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. These are round, basophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions that are composed of calcium, iron, and other minerals.

There is no specific treatment for cutaneous malakoplakia. The lesions usually resolve spontaneously with treatment of the underlying condition. However, in some cases, treatment with antibiotics may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Atypical mycobacterial infection is a rare, opportunistic infection that can occur in patients with weakened immune systems. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made by biopsy and culture of the infected tissue. Treatment is with antibiotics.
* Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, central nervous system, and skin. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, and headache. The diagnosis is made by blood tests, sputum cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Treatment is with antifungal medications.
* Calcinosis cutis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the skin. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including chronic renal failure, hyperparathyroidism, and tumors. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is with medications to reduce the level of calcium in the blood and to remove the calcium deposits from the skin.

A. Hypertrophic discoid lupus is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the skin. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous papules, plaques, and scarring. However, it does not typically cause verrucous nodules.

B. Eruptive keratoacanthomas are a type of skin cancer that can occur in clusters. They are typically dome-shaped, with a central crater. They can be mistaken for other skin lesions, such as molluscum contagiosum or verrucae. However, they do not typically occur in areas of tattoo pigment.

C. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is a non-neoplastic proliferation of the epidermis. It can occur in response to a variety of stimuli, including chronic irritation, inflammation, and foreign bodies. It can present as a verrucous nodule or plaque. In this case, the patient's history of discoid lupus and the fact that the lesions are restricted to areas of pink pigment within the tattoo are consistent with a diagnosis of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.

D. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ system in the body. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including erythema nodosum, lupus pernio, and sarcoidal nodules. However, it does not typically cause verrucous nodules.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is C. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. The patient's history of discoid lupus and the fact that the lesions are restricted to areas of pink pigment within the tattoo are consistent with this diagnosis.

Pemphigus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the desmoglein 1 and 3 proteins, which are essential for the adhesion of skin cells. The blisters in pemphigus erythematosus are typically flaccid and easily ruptured, and they can be very painful. The disease can be life-threatening if it is not treated.

Generalized fixed drug eruption is a type of allergic reaction that occurs when a person is exposed to a certain medication. The rash typically appears as a single, round or oval lesion that is red, raised, and itchy. The lesion may blister or ooze fluid. The rash usually disappears within a few weeks of stopping the medication, but it can sometimes recur if the person is re-exposed to the medication.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare, life-threatening skin disorder that is characterized by the widespread detachment of the skin from the underlying tissue. The rash typically begins with a fever and flu-like symptoms, followed by the appearance of red, blistering lesions on the skin. The lesions can then spread rapidly, causing large areas of skin to slough off. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a medical emergency that requires hospitalization and treatment with high doses of corticosteroids and other medications.

Rowell syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disease that is characterized by the development of blisters and target lesions on the skin. The blisters are typically flaccid and easily ruptured, and they can be very painful. The target lesions are round or oval lesions with a central area of dusky discoloration and a peripheral ring of erythema. Rowell syndrome is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, and it is thought to be caused by the deposition of immune complexes in the skin. The treatment of Rowell syndrome is aimed at controlling the underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. This may include the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and other medications.

The patient in the case presented with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and a generalized eruption of blisters and target lesions. The blisters were flaccid and easily ruptured, and the target lesions were round or oval with a central area of dusky discoloration and a peripheral ring of erythema. The patient's laboratory results showed hypocomplementemia, a speckled antinuclear antibody titer of 1:1280, and an antidouble-stranded DNA titer of 1:80. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of Rowell syndrome.

The blisters in pemphigus erythematosus are typically flaccid and easily ruptured, and they can be very painful. The disease can be life-threatening if it is not treated. However, the patient in the case presented with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the blisters in Rowell syndrome are typically not as painful as those in pemphigus erythematosus.
* Generalized fixed drug eruption is a type of allergic reaction that occurs when a person is exposed to a certain medication. The rash typically appears as a single, round or oval lesion that is red, raised, and itchy. The lesion may blister or ooze fluid.

 61%|██████    | 925/1525 [3:46:53<2:38:59, 15.90s/it]The correct diagnosis is X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1 (CMT1). This is a hereditary disorder of the peripheral nervous system that causes progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles in the hands, feet, and legs. It is the most common inherited neurological disorder, affecting about 1 in 2,500 people.

The patient in the case study presented with recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness over the course of 3 days. These symptoms are consistent with the symptoms of CMT1. The patient also had a positive family history of the disease, as his father and brother had been diagnosed with CMT1.

The patient's neurological examination revealed normal mental status, and the results of cranial nerve examination were normal. Although the patient had cavus feet, no atrophy was observed in the distal lower limbs. Muscle strength was classified as grade 4 for the left limbs and grade 3 for the right limbs, according to Medical Research Council criteria, and muscle tone was diminished. The sensory examination was unremarkable. Deep reflexes were diminished or absent. However, bilateral positive Babinski signs were observed.

Results from laboratory examinations, including blood electrolytes, cerebrospinal fluid, and lactate, were normal. Oligonucleotide bands and aquaporin 4 detection were negative. Craniocervical computed tomographic angiography results were normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal bilateral increases in T2 signal and diffusion restriction in the periventricular areas and the splenium of corpus callosum. Interestingly, a significant reduction of the abnormal signal was noted on MRI 3 months later. Electrophysiological examination of peripheral nerves revealed extensive bilateral nerve conduction abnormalities. Significantly reduced motor nerve conduction velocity was also observed in the median nerves (38.3 m per second in the left and 36.5 m per second in the right).

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with the diagnosis of CMT1. The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with the diagnosis, as they show demyelination of the white matter tracts in the brain. The patient's electrophysiological findings are also consistent with the diagnosis, as they show slowing of nerve conduction velocity.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain. It is caused by a blockage of an artery in the brain. TIAs are typically caused by a blood clot or a narrowing of the artery. The symptoms of a TIA usually resolve within 24 hours. The patient in the case study did not have any symptoms that were consistent with a TIA.
* Demyelinating disease is a condition that damages the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and tingling. There are several different types of demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The patient in the case study did not have any symptoms that were consistent with a demyelinating disease.
* Periodic paralysis is a rare disorder that causes episodes of muscle weakness. The weakness can be mild or severe, and it can affect any muscle in the body. Periodic paralysis is caused by a defect in the sodium channels in muscle cells. The patient in the case study did not have any symptoms that were consistent with periodic paralysis.

Ocular neuromyotonia is a rare disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions (myotonia) and repetitive nerve discharges (myokymia) of the extraocular muscles. It is often associated with other neurological disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, and multiple sclerosis.

The patient in the case report presents with several features consistent with ocular neuromyotonia, including intermittent diplopia, mild right ptosis, and mildly restricted supraduction, adduction, and infraduction of the right eye. The patient also has a history of a pituitary macroadenoma, which can be associated with ocular neuromyotonia.

This is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the cerebellum and other parts of the brain. It is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which is responsible for producing the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is important for the development and function of neurons in the cerebellum and other parts of the brain.

The symptoms of FXTAS typically begin in middle age or later. They can include tremor, ataxia (loss of coordination), cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes. The tremor is typically an intention tremor, which means it is worse when the person is trying to do something with their hands, such as writing or drinking from a glass. The ataxia can make it difficult to walk, stand, or coordinate movements. The cognitive impairment can include problems with memory, attention, and problem-solving. The behavioral changes can include anxiety, depression, and irritability.

There is no cure for FXTAS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments can include medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the autonomic nervous system, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. It is not caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, and it does not typically cause tremor or ataxia.
* Vascular dementia is a type of dementia that is caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain. It is not caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, and it does not typically cause tremor or ataxia.

Spinal dysraphism is a group of birth defects that affect the development of the spinal cord and the bones that protect it. It can occur anywhere along the spine, from the neck to the lower back.

The most common type of spinal dysraphism is spina bifida, which occurs when the spinal cord and its coverings do not close properly during fetal development. This can cause a range of problems, including paralysis, weakness, and problems with bladder and bowel control.

Other types of spinal dysraphism include tethered cord syndrome, meningocele, and myelomeningocele.

The exact cause of spinal dysraphism is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

There is no cure for spinal dysraphism, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment may include surgery, physical therapy, and medication.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not birth defects that affect the development of the spinal cord and the bones that protect it.

The patient has severe hypercholesterolemia and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts. It is a progressive disease that can lead to liver failure. Severe hypercholesterolemia is a common complication of PSC. It can cause xanthelasmata (yellow deposits of cholesterol under the skin around the eyes), palmar xanthomata (yellow deposits of cholesterol under the skin on the palms of the hands), and premature coronary artery disease.

Therapeutic plasma exchange is a procedure that removes harmful substances from the blood. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including severe hypercholesterolemia. Therapeutic plasma exchange is effective in lowering cholesterol levels in patients with PSC. It is also effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's hypercholesterolemia. A. Resolve obstructive cholestasis with biliary stent placement is not a treatment for severe hypercholesterolemia. B. Begin rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day is a treatment for hypercholesterolemia, but it is not likely to be effective in a patient with PSC. C. Begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day is a combination of the two most effective treatments for severe hypercholesterolemia in a patient with PSC. However, it is not the most effective treatment. D. Begin therapeutic plasma exchange is the most effective treatment for severe hypercholesterolemia in a patient with PSC.

 61%|██████    | 930/1525 [3:48:12<2:34:14, 15.55s/it]The correct diagnosis is middle ear paraganglioma. This is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of neuroendocrine cells that are found throughout the body, including the middle ear. Middle ear paragangliomas are most commonly found in adults over the age of 50, and they are more common in women than men. The most common symptom of a middle ear paraganglioma is hearing loss, which can be unilateral or bilateral. Other symptoms may include tinnitus, vertigo, facial nerve paralysis, and headaches.

The diagnosis of a middle ear paraganglioma is made based on a history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT scans typically show a well-defined, round or oval mass in the middle ear. MRI scans can provide more detailed information about the tumor, including its size, location, and relationship to surrounding structures.

The treatment for a middle ear paraganglioma is surgical removal. This can be performed through a transtemporal mastoidectomy, which is an incision behind the ear. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor completely while preserving the facial nerve and other important structures. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be recommended after surgery.

The prognosis for patients with middle ear paragangliomas is generally good. With complete surgical removal, the tumor is unlikely to recur. However, some patients may experience complications from surgery, such as facial nerve paralysis or hearing loss. These complications can be treated with rehabilitation or hearing aids.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms or imaging findings. Facial nerve hemangioma is a benign tumor that arises from the blood vessels of the facial nerve. Facial nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that surround the facial nerve. Middle ear adenoma is a benign tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the middle ear. These tumors are all rare, and they typically do not cause the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

OIDP is a benign epithelial tumor of the oral cavity that is characterized by an endophytic growth pattern with papillary projections of stratified squamous epithelium. The epithelium is often acanthotic and may contain mucinous cells. The subepithelial stroma may be inflamed and may contain lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. OIDP is most commonly seen in middle-aged adults and is more common in women. The most common location is the lower lip, followed by the tongue and buccal mucosa. The lesion is usually asymptomatic but may cause pain, bleeding, or ulceration. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Intraductal papilloma is a benign epithelial tumor of the breast that is characterized by a proliferation of ductal epithelium. The tumor is usually solitary and is most commonly seen in women in their 30s and 40s. The most common location is the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The lesion is usually asymptomatic but may cause pain, nipple discharge, or a lump. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent.
* Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor of the salivary glands that is characterized by a mixture of mucinous, epidermoid, and intermediate cells. The tumor is usually classified as low-grade, intermediate-grade, or high-grade. The most common location is the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular gland and the sublingual gland. The lesion is usually asymptomatic but may cause pain, facial paralysis, or a lump. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision, followed by radiation therapy in some cases. The prognosis depends on the grade of the tumor.
* Mucocele is a benign cystic lesion of the oral cavity that is caused by obstruction of a salivary gland duct. The lesion is usually small and asymptomatic but may cause pain, swelling, or ulceration. The diagnosis is made clinically. Treatment is usually incision and drainage. The prognosis is excellent.

JNA is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in adolescent males. It is thought to arise from the sphenopalatine artery and grows in the nasopharynx. JNA can cause a variety of symptoms, including nasal obstruction, epistaxis, facial pain, and proptosis.

The diagnosis of JNA is made based on clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. CT and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to diagnose JNA. CT scans typically show a mass that is isodense to muscle and enhances with contrast. MRI scans typically show a mass that is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and enhances with contrast.

The treatment of JNA is surgical resection. Radiation therapy may be used in patients who are not candidates for surgery or who have recurrent disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that typically occurs in adults. It is not a common cause of facial pain, fullness, and trismus in adolescents.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the head and neck. It is not a common cause of facial pain, fullness, and trismus in adolescents.

 61%|██████    | 933/1525 [3:49:02<2:40:30, 16.27s/it]The correct answer is A. Venous malformation.

A venous malformation is a congenital anomaly of the venous system characterized by abnormal collections of veins. Venous malformations are usually benign and do not require treatment, but they can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and bleeding.

The patient in this case has a history of intermittent left facial swelling and pain. She also has a palpable parotid lesion noted on physical examination. When asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver, she is noted to have more pronounced left facial swelling. This suggests that the lesion is a venous malformation, as venous malformations typically increase in size with Valsalva maneuver.

The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with a venous malformation. The T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image shows a T2 hyperintense lesion measuring 3.7 × 3.4 × 7.4 cm involving the left parotid gland and extending to the left side of the neck. The T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced angiography shows no evidence of significant high flow component. This suggests that the lesion is not an arteriovenous malformation.

The patient's history and physical examination findings, as well as her MRI findings, are all consistent with a diagnosis of venous malformation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Venous malformation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphatic malformation: Lymphatic malformations are congenital anomalies of the lymphatic system characterized by abnormal collections of lymphatic channels. Lymphatic malformations can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and infection. However, they do not typically increase in size with Valsalva maneuver. The patient's MRI findings are also not consistent with a lymphatic malformation.
* Arteriovenous malformation: Arteriovenous malformations are congenital anomalies of the arterial and venous system characterized by abnormal connections between arteries and veins. Arteriovenous malformations can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and bleeding. They can also be associated with high blood pressure and heart problems. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of arteriovenous malformation. Additionally, the T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced angiography shows no evidence of significant high flow component. This suggests that the lesion is not an arteriovenous malformation.
* Chronic sialadenitis: Chronic sialadenitis is a chronic inflammation of the salivary glands. It can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and tenderness of the salivary glands. Chronic sialadenitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, obstruction, and autoimmune disease. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of chronic sialadenitis. Additionally, the MRI findings are not consistent with chronic sialadenitis.

 61%|██████    | 934/1525 [3:49:16<2:34:46, 15.71s/it]The correct answer is C. Continue neuroimaging.

The patient is a 6-year-old girl with a history of upper respiratory tract infection and double vision. She has a complete absence of abduction on both eyes, consistent with bilateral sixth nerve palsy. The results of a fundus examination showed blurred optic nerve margins nasally.

The differential diagnosis for bilateral sixth nerve palsy in a child includes:

* Idiopathic sixth nerve palsy
* Neurological disorders such as meningitis, encephalitis, or brain tumor
* Vascular disorders such as stroke or migraine
* Infiltrative disorders such as sarcoidosis or leukemia
* Traumatic injury

In this case, the patient's history and examination are most consistent with an idiopathic sixth nerve palsy. However, it is important to rule out other causes, such as a neurological disorder or a vascular disorder.

Neuroimaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is the best way to rule out these other causes. CT is more sensitive for detecting acute hemorrhage, while MRI is more sensitive for detecting other abnormalities such as tumors or inflammation.

If neuroimaging is normal, then the patient can be managed conservatively with observation and prisms. If neuroimaging is abnormal, then the patient may need further treatment, such as steroids or surgery.

Continue oral antibiotics is not the correct answer because the patient's history and examination are not consistent with an infection. The patient has no fever, and there is no evidence of inflammation in the eyes.

Refer to neurology department is not the correct answer because the patient's history and examination are not consistent with a neurological disorder. The patient has no history of seizures or other neurological problems, and there is no evidence of focal neurological deficits.

Proceed with strabismus surgery is not the correct answer because the patient's double vision is likely to resolve on its own. Bilateral sixth nerve palsy in children is often idiopathic and self-limiting. Surgery is only indicated if the double vision is severe and persistent.
It is reasoning
 61%|██████▏   | 935/1525 [3:49:28<2:23:09, 14.56s/it]The correct answer is C. Electrophysiology.

The patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is concerning for the possibility of a secondary intraocular lymphoma. Secondary intraocular lymphoma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that can affect the retina and choroid. It is most commonly seen in patients with a history of systemic lymphoma, but it can also occur in patients with no known history of cancer.

The patient's presentation with rapid loss of vision and the presence of a white ring surrounding the optic nerve is also concerning for secondary intraocular lymphoma. This white ring, known as a peripapillary halo, is often seen in patients with secondary intraocular lymphoma. It is caused by the infiltration of the optic nerve by lymphoma cells.

Electrophysiology is a test that can be used to assess the function of the retina and optic nerve. It can be helpful in diagnosing secondary intraocular lymphoma. In patients with secondary intraocular lymphoma, electrophysiology studies typically show abnormal findings, such as decreased retinal potentials and optic nerve conduction times.

Treatment with oral prednisone is not the correct answer because it is not effective in treating secondary intraocular lymphoma. In fact, corticosteroids can actually worsen the disease.

A full laboratory workup for uveitis is not the correct answer because uveitis is not the likely diagnosis in this patient. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, redness, and blurred vision. However, uveitis is not typically associated with the development of a peripapillary halo.

Orbital imaging (B-scan or computed tomography) is not the correct answer because it is not necessary to diagnose secondary intraocular lymphoma. In most cases, a diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and electrophysiology studies. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, orbital imaging can be performed to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

The patient's presentation is consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis, a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. ANCA is a serological marker that is highly sensitive and specific for Wegener's granulomatosis. Testing for ANCA is the first step in the diagnostic workup for this condition.

Quantiferon gold is a test for tuberculosis infection. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) is a test for syphilis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is a test for sarcoidosis. None of these tests is specific for Wegener's granulomatosis.

ANCA testing is the most important diagnostic test for Wegener's granulomatosis. It is a sensitive and specific test that can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

The other tests mentioned are not specific for Wegener's granulomatosis and would not be helpful in the diagnosis of this condition.

The patient in the case report presents with a number of symptoms and signs that are consistent with Susac syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the brain, inner ear, and eyes. The characteristic findings on brain imaging in Susac syndrome are multifocal punctate areas of restricted diffusion, which are seen in the case report. The patient also has hearing loss and vertigo, which are common symptoms of Susac syndrome. The retinal vascular changes seen in the case report are also consistent with Susac syndrome.

The treatment for Susac syndrome is systemic steroids. Steroids help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the brain, inner ear, and eyes. In some cases, long-term immunosuppression may be necessary to prevent relapse of the disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. A is incorrect because dimethyl fumarate is a treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis, not Susac syndrome. C is incorrect because intravenous acyclovir and intravitreal foscarnet are treatments for viral retinitis, not Susac syndrome. D is incorrect because observing the patient for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy would not be appropriate for a patient with Susac syndrome.

The patient was in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. This type of injury is known to cause blunt abdominal trauma, which can result in diaphragmatic rupture. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with diaphragmatic rupture. He was hypotensive on arrival, which is a sign of hypovolemic shock. This can be caused by bleeding from a ruptured diaphragm. The chest X-ray showed marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. This is a sign of diaphragmatic rupture. The computed tomography scan of the chest showed a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta. This is a life-threatening injury that requires immediate surgery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Diaphragmatic eventration with lung collapse is a condition in which a portion of the diaphragm is displaced up into the chest cavity. This can cause lung collapse. However, the patient's chest X-ray did not show lung collapse.
* B. Pneumothorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is a condition in which air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause the lung to collapse and the diaphragm to be elevated. However, the patient's chest X-ray did not show a pneumothorax.
* C. Diaphragmatic rupture and a mediastinal hematoma is a condition in which the diaphragm is ruptured and a blood clot forms in the middle of the chest. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and shock. However, the patient's chest X-ray did not show a mediastinal hematoma.

 62%|██████▏   | 939/1525 [3:50:30<2:29:52, 15.35s/it]The correct answer is C. Sigmoid endometriosis.

Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the colon. It is the most common type of cancer of the colon. The risk of developing adenocarcinoma increases with age. Other risk factors include a family history of colon cancer, a personal history of colon polyps, and inflammatory bowel disease.

A rectosigmoid polyp is a growth that forms on the lining of the rectum or sigmoid colon. Polyps can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The risk of developing a polyp increases with age. Other risk factors include a family history of colon cancer, a personal history of colon polyps, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This tissue can grow in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, bowel, and other areas. Endometriosis can cause pain, infertility, and other problems.

Leiomyoma is a type of tumor that grows in the smooth muscle tissue of the body. Leiomyomas are most commonly found in the uterus, but they can also occur in the intestines, stomach, and other organs. Leiomyomas are usually benign (noncancerous), but they can sometimes become cancerous.

The patient in this case has a history of multiple episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding is associated with crampy abdominal pain. The patient has a history of factor 1 deficiency, which is a condition that makes her more likely to bleed. The patient also has a history of endometriosis. Endometriosis can cause bleeding from the uterus, but it can also cause bleeding from other organs, such as the bowel. The patient's computed tomography scan shows thickening and narrowing of the sigmoid colon. This finding is consistent with endometriosis. The patient's colonoscopy shows an exquisitely painful nodule at the rectosigmoid junction. This finding is also consistent with endometriosis. The patient's biopsy shows normal colonic mucosa. This finding suggests that the bleeding is not caused by a cancer or a polyp.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is sigmoid endometriosis.

 62%|██████▏   | 940/1525 [3:50:47<2:32:49, 15.67s/it]The correct answer is B. Immune-related hypophysitis.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab every 3 weeks developed headaches during the course of her treatment. The headaches started as mild morning headaches that improved with acetaminophen, but then progressed to daily headaches that were not relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient also reported low energy levels and difficulty reading. Physical examination showed no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup showed low ACTH and cortisol levels, a low TSH level, and a low sodium level. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed enlargement of the pituitary gland.

These findings are consistent with immune-related hypophysitis, which is an inflammatory condition of the pituitary gland that can occur in patients who are receiving immunotherapy for cancer. Immune-related hypophysitis is thought to be caused by an autoimmune response against the pituitary gland. The symptoms of immune-related hypophysitis can vary depending on the extent of the inflammation and the hormones that are affected. Common symptoms include headache, fatigue, vision problems, and changes in mood or behavior. Immune-related hypophysitis can be treated with corticosteroids, which can help to suppress the immune system and reduce the inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the damaged pituitary gland.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Brain metastasis: Brain metastasis is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the brain. The patient does not have any symptoms that are consistent with brain metastasis, such as seizures, weakness, or numbness. The MRI of the brain did not show any evidence of brain metastasis.
* Pituitary adenoma: A pituitary adenoma is a tumor that grows in the pituitary gland. The patient does not have any symptoms that are consistent with a pituitary adenoma, such as visual field defects, headaches, or changes in hormone levels. The MRI of the brain did not show any evidence of a pituitary adenoma.
* Mucocele: A mucocele is a cyst that is filled with mucus. Mucoceles can occur in the pituitary gland, but they are rare. The patient does not have any symptoms that are consistent with a mucocele, such as headache or visual field defects. The MRI of the brain did not show any evidence of a mucocele.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with carotenodermia, a benign condition caused by excessive intake of beta carotene. Carotenodermia is characterized by yellow-orange pigmentation of the skin, particularly the palms and soles. The pigmentation is usually reversible within a few weeks of discontinuing the offending agent.

In this case, the patient's laboratory tests are normal, which further supports the diagnosis of carotenodermia. There is no evidence of liver disease, which would be a more serious cause of yellowing skin.

A liver biopsy is not necessary in this case, as it is not likely to provide any additional information. Repeat liver function tests are also not necessary, as they are already normal. Empirical treatment with a topical steroid is not recommended, as carotenodermia is a benign condition that does not require treatment.

Therefore, the best course of action is to advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement. The pigmentation should resolve within a few weeks.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform a biopsy: A biopsy is not necessary in this case, as it is not likely to provide any additional information. Carotenodermia is a benign condition that does not require treatment.
* B. Order repeat liver function tests: Repeat liver function tests are not necessary in this case, as they are already normal.
* C. Empirically treat with a topical steroid: Empirical treatment with a topical steroid is not recommended, as carotenodermia is a benign condition that does not require treatment.

The patient has multiple myeloma, a plasma cell neoplasm that is characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Igs). The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made based on the presence of a monoclonal Ig in the serum or urine, bone marrow plasmacytosis, and lytic bone lesions.

The patient in this case has a monoclonal IgG κ band on serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis, a serum κ free light chain (FLC) level of 20 765 mg/L with a free κ to λ ratio of 296, and bone marrow biopsy showing a normocellular bone marrow with 10% κ-restricted plasma cells. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.

The treatment of multiple myeloma is based on the stage of disease. Patients with stage I or II disease are typically treated with a combination of chemotherapy and steroids. Patients with stage III or IV disease are typically treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.

The patient in this case has stage III disease, based on the presence of lytic bone lesions. He should be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and steroids. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen for multiple myeloma is bortezomib-dexamethasone. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that kills cancer cells by inhibiting the proteasome, a protein complex that is essential for the degradation of intracellular proteins. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Continue IV fluids and administer furosemide: This is not the appropriate treatment for multiple myeloma. IV fluids and furosemide are used to treat dehydration and hypervolemia, which are not present in this patient.
* C. Obtain renal biopsy: A renal biopsy is not necessary to diagnose multiple myeloma. The diagnosis can be made based on the findings on serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation electrophoresis, and bone marrow biopsy.
* D. Order skeletal survey: A skeletal survey is not necessary to diagnose multiple myeloma. The diagnosis can be made based on the findings on serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation electrophoresis, and bone marrow biopsy.

The patient in this case is a 35-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with 4 days of fever (temperature up to 39°C), extreme weakness, fatigue, and 1 to 2 days of progressive confusion. He was born in the United States but had traveled to Sierra Leone for a period of 3 weeks and had returned 1 week prior to presentation. He did not take any form of malaria prophylaxis, nor did he use insect repellent while traveling. He previously received the yellow fever vaccine but not hepatitis A or typhoid vaccination.

Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39.3°C, heart rate of 120/min, blood pressure of 119/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 32/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient was jaundiced, with scleral icterus, and was alert and oriented, although he had a fluctuating attention span and was unable to complete basic tasks. He was able to localize painful stimuli. No retinal lesions were present on dilated ophthalmologic examination. Laboratory tests were notable for a white blood cell count of 5000/μL with 88% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 1% bands, 5% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 0% eosinophils; hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 25 ×103/μL. Sodium level was 132 mEq/L; potassium, 4.0 mEq/L; chloride, 100 mEq/L; carbon dioxide, 15 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen, 40 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL. Total bilirubin level was 23.9 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 252 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 100 U/L. Venous lactate level was 49.6 mg/dL. A computed tomography scan of the head was unremarkable. A thin preparation blood smear was obtained (Figure).

The thin preparation blood smear shows malaria parasites, specifically Plasmodium falciparum. Plasmodium falciparum is the most severe form of malaria and is the most common cause of death from malaria. It is estimated that there are 200 million cases of P. falciparum malaria each year, resulting in 400,000 deaths.

The treatment for P. falciparum malaria is a combination of quinine and doxycycline. Quinine is a blood schizonticide, which means that it kills the malaria parasites that are in the blood. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic, which helps to prevent the development of complications from malaria, such as pneumonia and cerebral malaria.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Artemether-lumefantrine is a combination drug that is used to treat uncomplicated malaria. It is not effective against P. falciparum malaria.
* Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was once the mainstay of treatment for malaria. However, chloroquine resistance is now widespread, making it an ineffective treatment for P. falciparum malaria.
* An exchange transfusion is a procedure in which blood is removed from a patient and replaced with blood from a healthy donor. It is used to treat severe complications of malaria, such as cerebral malaria. However, it is not a first-line treatment for malaria and is only used in patients who are not responding to other treatments.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline.

Elastolytic granuloma is a rare, benign, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the accumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes in the dermis. It typically presents as multiple, small, erythematous nodules on the extremities. The nodules are often pruritic and may be associated with pain. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The treatment is usually with topical corticosteroids.

Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare, malignant soft tissue tumor that typically occurs in young adults. It is characterized by the proliferation of epithelioid cells, which are cells that resemble epithelial cells. The tumor can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the extremities. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The treatment is usually with surgery and chemotherapy.

Storiform collagenoma is a rare, benign, connective tissue tumor that typically occurs in adults. It is characterized by the proliferation of collagen fibers in a storiform pattern. The tumor can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the skin. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The treatment is usually with excision.

The patient in the case presented with multiple, asymptomatic, slightly erythematous cutaneous nodules, measuring 1.5 to 3.0 cm, over the calcanea and violaceous plaques, measuring 2 to 3 cm, on the extensor surface of the knees. The diagnosis of knee-located EED with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component is supported by the following findings:

* The patient's age and sex are consistent with the peak incidence of EED.
* The distribution of the lesions is consistent with EED, which typically involves the extensor surfaces of the extremities.
* The clinical appearance of the lesions is consistent with EED, which typically presents as multiple, small, erythematous nodules.
* The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimens are consistent with EED, which is characterized by the accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages in the dermis.

The diagnosis of elastolytic granuloma is less likely because the patient does not have any of the characteristic features of this disease, such as pain, pruritus, or a history of trauma.

The diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma is less likely because the patient is not in the typical age range for this disease, and the lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of this tumor.

The diagnosis of storiform collagenoma is less likely because the patient does not have any of the characteristic features of this disease, such as a history of trauma or a family history of the disease.

KVE is a severe, disseminated infection of the skin and mucous membranes caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). It is a rare but serious complication of varicella infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with Darier disease.

The patient in the case report is a primigravida woman in her 30s at 35 weeks’ gestation and with a history of Darier disease. She reported no history of pregnancy-related complications. Physical examination revealed confluent erythema with keratotic papulovesicles distributed on the face and neck (Figure, A). Honey-colored crusts were present on the left ear and preauricular area. The chest and inframammary area displayed occasional red, crusted papules. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 17.18 × 103/μL (reference range, 4.50-11.00 × 103/μL). A shave biopsy specimen and tissue culture were obtained from the center of an umbilicated papule on the neck (Figure, B and C).

The histopathological findings of the biopsy specimen are consistent with KVE. The epidermis shows full-thickness epidermal necrosis with focal areas of suprabasal acantholysis with corp ronds, corp grains, and parakeratosis. The dermis shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of lymphocytes and histiocytes. The tissue culture was positive for VZV.

The clinical and histopathological findings in this case are consistent with a diagnosis of KVE. The patient's history of Darier disease is a risk factor for the development of KVE. The elevated white blood cell count is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Impetigo is a superficial skin infection caused by group A streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by small, superficial vesicles that rupture and form honey-colored crusts. The patient in the case report does not have any of the typical features of impetigo.
* Pemphigoid gestationis is an autoimmune blistering disorder that occurs during pregnancy. It is characterized by blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. The patient in the case report does not have any of the typical features of pemphigoid gestationis.
* Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare, acute, vesicular eruption of the skin that is associated with group A streptococcal infection. It is characterized by small, grouped vesicles that are surrounded by an erythematous halo. The patient in the case report does not have any of the typical features of impetigo herpetiformis.

The patient in the case presented with gradual hair loss of the eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, and scalp for 4 years, swelling and painful hand joints for 13 months, and multiple asymptomatic nodules on the upper arms for 40 days. The patient exhibited no associated fever, analgesia or hypesthesia. He reported no previous infections or family or personal medical history of autoimmune diseases or psoriasis. He was previously treated for rheumatoid arthritis, but various arthritis treatments showed no improvements over 1 year. A physical examination showed diffuse infiltration of the face with loss of skin creases and diminished facial hair; all joints of both hands were swollen (Figure, A); multiple asymptomatic nodules without ulceration were present on his upper arms (Figure, B); decreased sensation to pain, temperature and/or touch and neuropathic changes were not found. Laboratory test results showed a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (27 mm/h) and significantly elevated rheumatoid factor (70.1 IU/mL). Additional immunology indicators, including C-reactive protein, anticyclic citrullinated peptide, antinuclear antibodies, and globulin levels were normal. X-ray and joint ultrasound results suggested osteoarthritis, synovitis, flexor tendon tenosynovitis, and bone erosions. Ultrasound results also indicated enlarged axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed uveitis.

A. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the joints. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. The patient in the case did not have any of the classic symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, such as fever, fatigue, or weight loss. Additionally, his rheumatoid factor was elevated, but his C-reactive protein and other immunology indicators were normal. This makes rheumatoid arthritis an unlikely diagnosis.

B. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of the joints. It is also characterized by a variety of other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, skin rash, and kidney problems. The patient in the case did not have any of these symptoms. Additionally, his antinuclear antibodies were normal, which is a finding that is typically seen in SLE. This makes SLE an unlikely diagnosis.

C. Arthritis associated with other connective tissue diseases is a diagnosis that is given when a patient has arthritis and another autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. The patient in the case did not have any of the other autoimmune diseases that are typically associated with arthritis. Additionally, his antinuclear antibodies were normal, which is a finding that is typically seen in these diseases. This makes arthritis associated with other connective tissue diseases an unlikely diagnosis.

D. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness. The patient in the case presented with many of the classic symptoms of leprosy, including skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness. Additionally, his skin biopsy showed numerous acid-fast bacilli, which is a finding that is typically seen in leprosy. This makes leprosy the most likely diagnosis.

 62%|██████▏   | 947/1525 [3:52:33<2:30:36, 15.63s/it]The correct answer is A. Trauma-focused psychotherapy.

The patient has a history of trauma, including combat exposure and early childhood trauma. He is experiencing symptoms of PTSD, including intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance, hyperarousal, and numbing. He is also experiencing symptoms of depression, including sadness, hopelessness, and anhedonia.

Trauma-focused psychotherapy is a type of psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD. It is a time-limited, structured therapy that helps patients to process their traumatic memories and to develop coping skills.

Pharmacotherapy with risperidone, prazosin, or propranolol may also be helpful in treating PTSD. However, these medications are not as effective as trauma-focused psychotherapy. Additionally, they can have side effects, such as weight gain, sedation, and sexual dysfunction.

Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is trauma-focused psychotherapy. This will help him to address the underlying causes of his PTSD and to develop coping skills that will help him to manage his symptoms.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

A. Trauma-focused psychotherapy: Trauma-focused psychotherapy is a type of psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD. It is a time-limited, structured therapy that helps patients to process their traumatic memories and to develop coping skills.

B. Pharmacotherapy with risperidone: Risperidone is an antipsychotic medication that is sometimes used to treat PTSD. However, it is not as effective as trauma-focused psychotherapy. Additionally, it can have side effects, such as weight gain, sedation, and sexual dysfunction.

C. Pharmacotherapy with prazosin: Prazosin is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that is sometimes used to treat PTSD. It is thought to work by reducing the symptoms of hyperarousal. However, it is not as effective as trauma-focused psychotherapy. Additionally, it can have side effects, such as dizziness, hypotension, and priapism.

D. Pharmacotherapy with propranolol: Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic blocker that is sometimes used to treat PTSD. It is thought to work by reducing the symptoms of hyperarousal. However, it is not as effective as trauma-focused psychotherapy. Additionally, it can have side effects, such as bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm.

 62%|██████▏   | 948/1525 [3:52:43<2:14:21, 13.97s/it]The correct answer is C. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).

Hypervitaminosis A is a condition that occurs when a person has too much vitamin A in their body. It can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, and dry skin. However, it does not cause the symptoms that the patient in the case study is experiencing.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition that causes lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting when a person stands up. It can also cause symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and nausea. However, it does not cause the symptoms that the patient in the case study is experiencing.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, hair loss, and amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods). However, it does not cause the symptoms that the patient in the case study is experiencing.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. This can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and salt cravings. The patient in the case study is experiencing all of these symptoms, which makes Addison disease the most likely diagnosis.

In addition to the symptoms described above, patients with Addison disease may also have hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), particularly in areas that are exposed to the sun, such as the hands, face, and knuckles. This is due to the body's attempt to compensate for the lack of cortisol by producing more of the hormone ACTH. ACTH stimulates the production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color.

The patient in the case study also has hyperpigmentation, which is another sign of Addison disease.

The diagnosis of Addison disease is confirmed with blood tests to measure the levels of cortisol and aldosterone. Treatment involves taking replacement hormones, such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. With treatment, most patients with Addison disease can lead normal, active lives.

 62%|██████▏   | 949/1525 [3:53:00<2:22:19, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is C. Pulmonary valve replacement for severe pulmonary regurgitation.

The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). She has had two previous surgeries, a Blalock-Taussig shunt in early childhood and subsequent TOF repair at age 3 years. She is now asymptomatic, but her recent echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary regurgitation.

Pulmonary regurgitation is a condition in which the pulmonary valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. In severe cases, it can lead to heart failure.

The treatment for severe pulmonary regurgitation is usually surgery to replace the pulmonary valve. This is a major surgery, but it is usually very successful in relieving symptoms and preventing complications.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Sildenafil is a medication used to treat pulmonary hypertension, but it is not effective for treating pulmonary regurgitation. Balloon valvotomy is a procedure that can be used to open a stenotic pulmonary valve, but it is not effective for treating pulmonary regurgitation. Surgical intervention for residual ventricular septal defect is a procedure that can be used to close a ventricular septal defect, but it is not appropriate for this patient because she does not have a ventricular septal defect.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pulmonary valve replacement for severe pulmonary regurgitation.

Atypical carcinoid is a rare, neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or other organs. It is typically slow-growing and metastasises late in the course of the disease. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Atypical carcinoid is not typically associated with dysphagia.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a rare, neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the thyroid gland. It is typically slow-growing and metastasises late in the course of the disease. The most common symptoms are a neck mass, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is not typically associated with dyspnea.

Hemangiopericytoma is a rare, vascular tumor that can occur in any part of the body. It is typically slow-growing and metastasises late in the course of the disease. The most common symptoms are a mass, pain, and swelling. Hemangiopericytoma is not typically associated with dysphagia.

Malignant carotid body tumor is a rare, neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the carotid body. It is typically fast-growing and metastasises early in the course of the disease. The most common symptoms are a neck mass, headache, and dysphagia. Malignant carotid body tumor is the most likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings.

A glioma is a type of brain tumor that starts in glial cells, which are the cells that support and protect neurons. Basal encephaloceles are herniations of the brain through a defect in the skull at the base of the skull. Teratomas are tumors that contain a mixture of tissues from different germ layers, such as skin, hair, teeth, and muscle.

The patient in this case presented with respiratory distress, which is a common symptom of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas. The mass was also located in the left mid-nasal cavity, which is a common location for these tumors. Additionally, the mass was smooth, epithelialized, and pedunculated, which are all features of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas. Histologic examination revealed a lesion characterized by regions of cartilage admixed with irregular areas of chondromyxoid stroma containing spindle cells, which is the characteristic appearance of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas.

Intranasal gliomas, basal encephaloceles, and teratomas are all rare tumors that can occur in the nasal cavity. However, they do not typically present with respiratory distress and they are not typically located in the left mid-nasal cavity. Additionally, they do not have the characteristic histologic appearance of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma.

 62%|██████▏   | 952/1525 [3:53:45<2:26:56, 15.39s/it]The correct answer is D. Chordoma.

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is a type of cancer that arises from a benign tumor called a pleomorphic adenoma. It is the most common type of salivary gland cancer. The patient in this case does not have a history of salivary gland disease, and the mass is located in the retropharyngeal space, which is not a common location for carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of the mass do not show the characteristic features of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, such as the presence of epithelial cells with malignant features.

Chordoid meningioma is a type of meningioma that arises from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It is a rare tumor that is most commonly diagnosed in adults. The patient in this case is in her 30s, which is a young age for chordoid meningioma. Additionally, the mass is located in the retropharyngeal space, which is not a common location for chordoid meningioma. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of the mass do not show the characteristic features of chordoid meningioma, such as the presence of meningothelial cells with malignant features.

Chondrosarcoma is a type of cancer that arises from cartilage. It is a rare tumor that is most commonly diagnosed in adults. The patient in this case is in her 30s, which is a young age for chondrosarcoma. Additionally, the mass is located in the retropharyngeal space, which is not a common location for chondrosarcoma. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of the mass do not show the characteristic features of chondrosarcoma, such as the presence of chondrocytes with malignant features.

Chordoma is a type of cancer that arises from the notochord, a structure that forms in the embryo and eventually gives rise to the spine. It is a rare tumor that is most commonly diagnosed in adults. The patient in this case is in her 30s, which is a young age for chordoma. Additionally, the mass is located in the retropharyngeal space, which is a common location for chordoma. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of the mass show the characteristic features of chordoma, such as the presence of chordoma cells with eosinophilic granular, clear, or bubbly cytoplasm on a basophilic myxoid stromal background. Additionally, the results from immunohistochemical analysis are positive for brachyury, a protein that is expressed in chordoma cells.

 62%|██████▏   | 953/1525 [3:54:02<2:30:03, 15.74s/it]The correct answer is C. Desmoid tumor.

Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterized by a rapid growth of a painful mass, and often metastasizes to the lungs, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. The patient in the case presentation is a 2-year-old boy with a unilateral neck mass that has persisted for 4 months. The mass is firm, immobile, and nontender, and is affixed to the underlying right mandible. These findings are not consistent with Ewing sarcoma, which typically presents as a painful mass.

Eosinophilic granuloma is a benign condition that is characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the bone marrow and other tissues. It typically occurs in children and adolescents, and most often affects the skull, ribs, and long bones. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the typical symptoms of eosinophilic granuloma, such as fever, bone pain, or anemia.

Lymphoma is a group of cancers that affect the lymphatic system. There are many different types of lymphoma, and they can vary in their presentation and prognosis. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the typical symptoms of lymphoma, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss.

Desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive tumors of fibroblasts. They are typically found in the abdomen, but can also occur in the head and neck region. The patient in the case presentation has a desmoid tumor of the mandible. This is consistent with the patient's history of a slowly growing, painless mass that is affixed to the underlying bone. Desmoid tumors are typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Desmoid tumor. The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation.

 63%|██████▎   | 954/1525 [3:54:18<2:31:53, 15.96s/it]The correct answer is B. Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats.

The patient has a strong family history of bilateral ptosis, which suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The most common cause of autosomal dominant ptosis is Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), which is caused by an expansion of CTG triplet repeats in the DMPK gene. Ptosis is one of the most common features of DM1, and it typically begins in the second or third decade of life. Other features of DM1 include muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction).

The patient in this case does not have any of the other features of DM1, so it is unlikely that he has the disease. However, it is still possible that he has a different genetic mutation that causes ptosis. Genetic testing can be used to identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the ptosis. This information can be used to make a diagnosis, to provide information about the prognosis, and to make decisions about treatment.

A. Ptosis repair by Müllerectomy or levator advancement is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms that would warrant surgery. The ptosis is mild and does not affect his vision. In addition, the patient is only in his late 50s, so it is likely that the ptosis will not progress significantly in the future.

C. Treatment with prednisone is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of an inflammatory condition. In addition, prednisone can have serious side effects, so it is not a first-line treatment for ptosis.

D. Observation is not the correct answer because the patient has a strong family history of bilateral ptosis. It is important to determine the cause of the ptosis so that appropriate treatment can be given.

 63%|██████▎   | 955/1525 [3:54:28<2:14:23, 14.15s/it]The correct answer is C. Start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper.

The patient in this case has a history of blurry vision associated with frontal headaches for a week. He has no past medical or ocular history. His symptoms prompted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, orbits, and cervical spine which were unremarkable. Laboratory test results for the presence of Lyme disease, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzymes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were normal.

The best corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye. Motility, intraocular pressures, and pupillary light reflexes were normal. The anterior segment examination results were normal, and the lenses were clear bilaterally. A fundus examination showed vitreous cells in both eyes, but the optic nerve and retinal vessels were visualized clearly. Also, both eyes had optic nerve hyperemia and multiple shallow serous retinal detachments. The fluorescein angiography of both eyes demonstrated optic disc leakage, multiple pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence, and fluorescein pooling in the areas of serous detachment.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause blurry vision, loss of color vision, and pain in the eye. The most common cause of optic neuritis is multiple sclerosis (MS). However, optic neuritis can also be caused by other conditions, such as Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, and vasculitis.

The treatment for optic neuritis depends on the underlying cause. In the case of MS, treatment is typically with steroids, such as prednisone. Steroids help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. Prednisone is typically started at a high dose and then tapered slowly over several weeks.

In the case of this patient, the best course of treatment is to start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper. This will help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of MS. If the patient develops new symptoms, such as numbness or tingling in the extremities, he should be evaluated for MS.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Surgical decompression of vortex veins is not a treatment for optic neuritis.
B. B-scan ultrasonography is a test that can be used to evaluate the optic nerve. However, it is not a treatment for optic neuritis.
C. Checking blood pressure is important in all patients, but it is not a specific treatment for optic neuritis.

 63%|██████▎   | 956/1525 [3:54:41<2:08:37, 13.56s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain a complete blood cell count.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a blood test that measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. It can help to diagnose a variety of conditions, including anemia, infection, and leukemia.

In the case of the man in his 30s with bilateral branch retinal vein occlusions, a CBC is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to his vision problems. For example, anemia can cause retinal hemorrhages, and infection can cause inflammation of the blood vessels in the retina. A CBC can also help to determine if the man is at risk for complications from his retinal vein occlusions, such as neovascularization (the growth of new blood vessels in the retina).

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not provide the necessary information to diagnose or treat the man's condition. Obtaining an infectious and inflammatory panel would not be helpful in this case, as the man's history and physical examination do not suggest an infection or inflammatory condition. Observing the man's condition would also not be helpful, as retinal vein occlusions can progress rapidly and can lead to permanent vision loss. Injecting an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drug would not be appropriate in this case, as anti-VEGF drugs are used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, not retinal vein occlusions.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain a complete blood cell count.

 63%|██████▎   | 957/1525 [3:54:51<1:58:53, 12.56s/it]The correct answer is B. Biopsy.

A vitrectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the vitreous humor, the clear gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. It is not the correct answer in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a vitreous hemorrhage or other condition that would require a vitrectomy.

Observing and managing glaucoma is not the correct answer in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve, which can lead to vision loss. The patient's visual acuity is 20/20 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye, which is not consistent with glaucoma. Additionally, the patient does not have any of the other classic symptoms of glaucoma, such as a halo around lights or eye pain.

Enucleation is the surgical removal of an eye. It is not the correct answer in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a condition that would require enucleation. Enucleation is typically reserved for cases of severe retinal detachment, cancer, or trauma.

The correct answer is B. Biopsy. A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. In this case, a biopsy would be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's white vitreous deposits. The deposits could be caused by a number of different conditions, including infection, inflammation, or cancer. A biopsy would help to determine the underlying cause and allow for the appropriate treatment.

 63%|██████▎   | 958/1525 [3:55:06<2:04:54, 13.22s/it]The correct answer is B. Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.

Acute cholecystitis is a condition in which the gallbladder becomes inflamed. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that sits under the liver. It stores bile, a fluid that helps digest fats.

Gallbladder stones are hard deposits that can form in the gallbladder. They are made of cholesterol, bile salts, and other substances. Gallbladder stones can block the opening of the gallbladder, which can cause pain, inflammation, and infection.

In intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder, the gallbladder ruptures and the bile leaks into the liver. This can cause infection and inflammation of the liver.

The patient in the case presented with right upper abdominal pain, fever, and chills. He also had a white blood cell count of 13,200/μL and an alkaline phosphatase of 259 U/L. These findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis.

The ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a large hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver along with gallstones. This finding is also consistent with acute cholecystitis.

The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan showed a large hypodense area measuring 16 × 11.8 × 12.4 cm, involving segments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, along with a gallstone. This finding is consistent with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Liver abscess is a collection of pus in the liver. It is usually caused by an infection with bacteria or fungi. The patient in the case did not have any findings consistent with liver abscess, such as fever, chills, or jaundice.
* Gallbladder cancer with contiguous liver infiltration is a rare type of cancer that starts in the gallbladder and spreads to the liver. The patient in the case did not have any findings consistent with gallbladder cancer, such as a mass in the right upper abdomen or a liver biopsy that shows cancer cells.
* Necrotic liver tumor is a tumor that has died and started to break down. It can be caused by cancer, infection, or other diseases. The patient in the case did not have any findings consistent with necrotic liver tumor, such as a mass in the right upper abdomen or a liver biopsy that shows cancer cells.

 63%|██████▎   | 959/1525 [3:55:22<2:14:02, 14.21s/it]The correct answer is A. Mucocele of the appendix.

A mucocele is a cystic lesion of the appendix that is filled with mucus. It is the most common type of cystic lesion of the appendix, accounting for up to 80% of cases. Mucoceles are typically asymptomatic and are often found incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally rupture, leading to peritonitis.

The most common cause of a mucocele is obstruction of the appendix lumen by a fecalith, foreign body, or tumor. This obstruction leads to distention of the appendix and accumulation of mucus. In some cases, the mucus may become infected, leading to inflammation and ulceration of the appendix wall.

The diagnosis of a mucocele is usually made on imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI. Mucoceles typically appear as a well-defined, cystic lesion in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. They may be associated with thickening of the appendix wall or periappendiceal inflammation.

Treatment of a mucocele is usually conservative, with antibiotics to treat any infection and observation to ensure that the lesion does not rupture. In some cases, surgical removal of the appendix may be necessary.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most common type of cystic lesion of the appendix.

* A cecal diverticulum is a saclike protrusion of the mucosa and submucosa through the muscularis propria of the cecum. It is the most common type of diverticulum in the colon, accounting for up to 70% of cases. Cecal diverticula are typically asymptomatic and are often found incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally become inflamed, leading to diverticulitis.
* A Meckel diverticulum is a remnant of the embryonic yolk stalk that is found in the distal ileum. It is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in up to 2% of the population. Meckel diverticula are typically asymptomatic, but they can occasionally become inflamed, leading to Meckel diverticulitis. They can also bleed or become obstructed.
* An ileal duplication cyst is a congenital anomaly that results from incomplete separation of the developing ileum. It is a rare condition, occurring in only 1 in 10,000 births. Ileal duplication cysts can be asymptomatic or they can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting. They can also become infected or obstructed.

 63%|██████▎   | 960/1525 [3:55:38<2:19:45, 14.84s/it]The correct diagnosis is gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are mesenchymal tumors that arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, a type of cell that helps to regulate intestinal movement. They are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for approximately 1% of all gastrointestinal tumors. GISTs can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, but they are most common in the stomach and small intestine.

The patient in the case presented with significant abdominal pain. A noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 15 × 13 × 11-cm heterogeneous cystic mass that appeared to originate from the body of the pancreas and protrude into the gastric wall. Results of CT scan also revealed a 3-cm hypodense lesion on the left lobe of the liver, ascites, and splenomegaly. Further evaluation with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed extrinsic compression of the gastric wall from a large mixed solid/cystic lesion with septations and well-defined margins with no clear involvement of the gastric wall. A thin, reddish-brown fluid (700 mL) was aspirated from the cystic component. Analysis of the aspirate showed no tumor cells or mucinous material, and normal carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, and amylase. Fine-needle aspiration was performed on the solid component of the cystic tumor, which showed positive staining for CD117 and negative staining for α-smooth muscle actin and CD34.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of GIST. GISTs are typically positive for CD117, a marker of KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor that is frequently mutated in GISTs. GISTs are typically negative for α-smooth muscle actin and CD34, which are markers of smooth muscle tumors and hematopoietic tumors, respectively.

The treatment of GISTs depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Small, localized tumors can be treated with surgical resection. Larger tumors or tumors that are not amenable to surgery can be treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In some cases, targeted therapy with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) may be used.

The prognosis for patients with GISTs is generally good. With treatment, the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized GISTs is approximately 90%. The 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic GISTs is approximately 50%.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Solid pseudopapillary neoplasia of the pancreas is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in young women. It is characterized by a solid and cystic appearance on imaging studies. The tumor is positive for α-smooth muscle actin and CD34, but negative for CD117.
* Atypical mucinous cystic neoplasia of the pancreas is a precancerous lesion that can progress to pancreatic cancer. It is characterized by a cystic appearance on imaging studies and the presence of mucinous cells in the cyst fluid. The tumor is positive for CA19-9, but negative for CD117.
* Pancreatic pseudocyst is a noncancerous fluid-filled cyst that typically develops after pancreatitis. It is characterized by a cystic appearance on imaging studies and the absence of tumor cells.

The patient has a herpetic whitlow, which is a viral infection of the fingers or toes. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which is the same virus that causes cold sores. Herpetic whitlow is usually not serious, but it can be painful and can spread to other parts of the body.

The treatment for herpetic whitlow is antiviral medication, such as valacyclovir. Valacyclovir works by preventing the herpes simplex virus from multiplying. It is important to start taking valacyclovir as soon as possible after you develop symptoms of herpetic whitlow.

The patient in the case study has been prescribed valacyclovir. He should continue to take this medication as prescribed. He should also avoid touching the rash, as this can spread the infection to other parts of his body. He should also wash his hands frequently to prevent the spread of the infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option A, perform local incision and debridement, is not necessary for herpetic whitlow. Option B, admit to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy, is also not necessary for herpetic whitlow. Option D, instruct the patient to take only the clindamycin, is incorrect because clindamycin is not an effective treatment for herpetic whitlow.

 63%|██████▎   | 962/1525 [3:56:06<2:11:21, 14.00s/it]The correct answer is D. Start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is a progressive disease that makes it difficult to breathe. He also has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. The patient's presentation of increasing dyspnea on exertion, requiring increasing flow rates of oxygen, is consistent with pulmonary embolism.

A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan was obtained, which showed multiple mismatched perfusion defects. This is a finding that is consistent with pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary angiogram was also performed, which showed multiple pulmonary emboli. This is a definitive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

The treatment for pulmonary embolism is anticoagulation with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by oral anticoagulation with warfarin for 3-6 months. In some cases, surgical embolectomy may be necessary. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove blood clots from the pulmonary arteries. It is typically reserved for patients with severe pulmonary embolism who do not respond to anticoagulation.

In this case, the patient should be started on anticoagulation with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. He should also be referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

Choice A is incorrect because parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators are not the first-line treatment for pulmonary embolism. These medications may be used to treat the symptoms of pulmonary embolism, such as dyspnea, but they do not treat the underlying cause of the condition.

Choice B is incorrect because starting heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months is the standard treatment for pulmonary embolism. However, in this case, the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is a risk factor for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Therefore, the patient should be referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

Choice C is incorrect because starting anticoagulation and referring the patient for surgical embolectomy is only necessary in patients with severe pulmonary embolism who do not respond to anticoagulation. In this case, the patient's pulmonary embolism is not severe and he is responding to anticoagulation. Therefore, surgical embolectomy is not necessary.

 63%|██████▎   | 963/1525 [3:56:16<2:01:49, 13.01s/it]The correct answer is B. Pseudoporphyria. The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplant, and graft-vs-host disease are all risk factors for pseudoporphyria. The patient's skin lesions are consistent with pseudoporphyria, as they are flaccid bullae and erosions on sun-exposed areas. The biopsy specimen shows characteristic findings of pseudoporphyria, including subepidermal bullae with minimal inflammation and scattered hemosiderin deposits in the papillary dermis.

Acquired epidermolysis bullosa is a rare, acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. It is not associated with a history of acute myeloid leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplant, or graft-vs-host disease. The patient's skin lesions are not typical of acquired epidermolysis bullosa.

Photoallergic drug reaction is a type of allergic reaction that occurs when the skin is exposed to both a drug and ultraviolet light. It is not associated with a history of acute myeloid leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplant, or graft-vs-host disease. The patient's skin lesions are not typical of a photoallergic drug reaction.

Graft-vs-host disease is a condition that can occur after an allogeneic stem cell transplant. It occurs when the transplanted immune cells attack the host's tissues. It is not associated with the development of bullae and erosions on sun-exposed areas. The patient's skin lesions are not typical of graft-vs-host disease.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. Pseudoporphyria.

Erythrodermic sarcoidosis is a rare form of sarcoidosis that affects the skin. It is characterized by widespread redness and scaling of the skin. The condition can be difficult to treat, and there is no cure.

The patient in the case presented with a 20- to 30-year medical history of occasionally pruritic erythematous papules involving the trunk and extremities. He denied associated fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, cough, difficulty breathing, or chest pain. Findings from the physical examination revealed red-brown monomorphic papules coalescing into plaques on the face, trunk, and extremities. There were thin erythematous plaques with overlying scale on bilateral extensor upper and lower extremities. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen from his right upper extremity was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathologic analysis. Periodic acid–Schiff and acid-fast bacilli stains were also performed.

The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed noncaseating granulomas in the dermis. The periodic acid–Schiff and acid-fast bacilli stains were negative.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of erythrodermic sarcoidosis. The differential diagnosis for erythrodermic sarcoidosis includes other causes of erythroderma, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and lymphoma.

The treatment for erythrodermic sarcoidosis is aimed at controlling the inflammation and relieving the symptoms. Treatment may include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and phototherapy.

The prognosis for erythrodermic sarcoidosis is variable. Some patients have a good response to treatment and experience a complete remission. Others have a more chronic course with persistent skin lesions.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Disseminated granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition characterized by small, raised, red or skin-colored bumps. The bumps are usually found on the hands, feet, arms, and legs. Disseminated granuloma annulare is not associated with erythroderma.

C. Mycosis fungoides is a type of skin cancer that starts in the T cells, a type of white blood cell. Mycosis fungoides is characterized by a rash that often starts on the trunk or upper back and then spreads to other parts of the body. The rash may be red, scaly, or crusty. Mycosis fungoides is not associated with erythroderma.

D. Tuberculid is a skin condition that is caused by an infection with the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculid is characterized by red, raised bumps that are often found on the hands, feet, and face. Tuberculid is not associated with erythroderma.

 63%|██████▎   | 965/1525 [3:56:46<2:11:59, 14.14s/it]The correct answer is A. Botryomycosis.

Botryomycosis is a chronic, pyogenic, suppurative infection caused by the gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacterium Actinomyces spp. It is most commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions, but can occur anywhere in the world. The infection typically presents as a single or multiple nodules or abscesses on the skin or subcutaneous tissues. The nodules are often painful and may drain a purulent exudate.

The diagnosis of botryomycosis is made based on clinical presentation, history, and laboratory findings. The characteristic finding on histopathology is the presence of sulfur granules, which are aggregates of bacteria and inflammatory cells. Gram staining and culture can be used to identify the causative organism.

The treatment of botryomycosis is with antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics are penicillin and tetracycline. Surgery may be necessary to drain abscesses or to remove infected tissue.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cutaneous tuberculosis is a chronic, granulomatous infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is most commonly seen in patients with HIV infection. The infection typically presents as a single or multiple papules or nodules on the skin. The papules are often painless and may not drain. The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis is made based on clinical presentation, history, and laboratory findings. The characteristic finding on histopathology is the presence of granulomas. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining and culture can be used to identify the causative organism. The treatment of cutaneous tuberculosis is with antituberculosis drugs.
* Digital mucous cyst is a benign, cystic lesion of the distal interphalangeal joint. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged women. The lesion typically presents as a small, painless, fluctuant swelling on the dorsal aspect of the distal interphalangeal joint. The diagnosis of digital mucous cyst is made based on clinical presentation and physical examination. Aspiration of the cyst may reveal a clear or viscous fluid. The treatment of digital mucous cyst is with aspiration or surgical excision.
* Foreign-body reaction is a localized inflammatory reaction to a foreign body. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most commonly seen in the skin. The reaction is typically caused by an insect bite, splinter, or other foreign object. The lesion typically presents as a small, red, raised area of skin. The area may be painful and may drain a serous or purulent exudate. The diagnosis of foreign-body reaction is made based on clinical presentation and history. The foreign body can often be seen on physical examination or with imaging studies. The treatment of foreign-body reaction is with removal of the foreign object.

 63%|██████▎   | 966/1525 [3:57:03<2:17:46, 14.79s/it]The correct answer is E. Congenital myasthenia gravis.

Congenital myasthenia gravis (CMG) is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the muscles. It is caused by a defect in the genes that control the production of acetylcholine receptors, which are essential for muscle contraction. Symptoms of CMG usually appear in infancy or early childhood and can vary from person to person. Some people with CMG have only mild symptoms, while others may have severe muscle weakness that can make it difficult to walk, talk, or swallow. There is no cure for CMG, but treatment can help to improve symptoms and quality of life.

The patient in the case study presented with muscle weakness that had been slowly increasing since infancy. He also had a waddling gait, hyperlordosis, and facial weakness. These symptoms are consistent with CMG. The patient's asthma attacks were also significant, as they were associated with a temporary improvement in his muscle strength. This is known as a myasthenic crisis, and it is a characteristic feature of CMG.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pompe disease is a rare, genetic disorder that affects the muscles. It is caused by a defect in the gene that codes for the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. This enzyme is essential for the breakdown of glycogen, a type of sugar that is stored in the muscles. Symptoms of Pompe disease usually appear in infancy or early childhood and can vary from person to person. Some people with Pompe disease have only mild symptoms, while others may have severe muscle weakness and heart failure. There is no cure for Pompe disease, but treatment can help to improve symptoms and quality of life.
* Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the nerves that control movement. It is caused by a defect in the gene that codes for the protein SMN1. This protein is essential for the survival of motor neurons, which are the nerves that control movement. Symptoms of SMA usually appear in infancy or early childhood and can vary from person to person. Some people with SMA have only mild symptoms, while others may have severe muscle weakness and respiratory problems. There is no cure for SMA, but treatment can help to improve symptoms and quality of life.
* Seronegative myasthenia gravis is a type of myasthenia gravis that does not produce antibodies against acetylcholine receptors. This type of myasthenia gravis is less common than the antibody-positive form of the disease. Symptoms of seronegative myasthenia gravis are similar to those of the antibody-positive form of the disease, but they may be more difficult to diagnose. Treatment for seronegative myasthenia gravis is similar to treatment for the antibody-positive form of the disease.
* Becker muscular dystrophy is a type of muscular dystrophy that affects males. It is caused by a defect in the gene that codes for the protein dystrophin. Dystrophin is essential for the structural integrity of muscle cells. Symptoms of Becker muscular dystrophy usually appear in adolescence or early adulthood and can vary from person to person. Some people with Becker muscular dystrophy have only mild symptoms, while others may have severe muscle weakness and difficulty walking. There is no cure for Becker muscular dystrophy, but treatment can help to improve symptoms and quality of life.

 63%|██████▎   | 967/1525 [3:57:20<2:23:20, 15.41s/it]The correct diagnosis is hypothyroidism. The patient is short for her age, has a relatively short, thick neck with acanthosis nigricans, dry skin, Tanner stage II breasts, and nonpitting edema of her hands. These findings are consistent with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, and hair loss. Hypothyroidism can also cause problems with the bones and joints, including slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). SCFE is a condition in which the head of the femur (the upper part of the thigh bone) slips off the neck of the femur. It is most common in children and adolescents, and it is more common in boys than girls. The risk of SCFE is increased in children with hypothyroidism.

Hyponatremia is a condition in which the blood sodium level is too low. It can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Hyponatremia is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin or does not use insulin effectively. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Diabetes mellitus can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, increased thirst and urination, and blurred vision. Diabetes mellitus is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Fatty liver disease is a condition in which the liver contains too much fat. It is a common condition, especially in people who are overweight or obese. Fatty liver disease can cause symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain. Fatty liver disease is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is hypothyroidism. The patient's symptoms are consistent with hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism can cause SCFE. The other choices are not likely causes of the patient's symptoms.

 63%|██████▎   | 968/1525 [3:57:34<2:20:22, 15.12s/it]The correct answer is C. Coronary angiography.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. These features include:

* A history of recent emotional distress (the death of her daughter)
* Chest pain that is consistent with angina (chest pain due to ischemia of the heart muscle)
* Electrocardiographic changes consistent with ischemia
* Echocardiographic evidence of apical ballooning of the left ventricle

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient condition that is thought to be caused by a surge of catecholamines (stress hormones) in response to an emotional or physical stressor. The catecholamine surge can cause the left ventricle to become weak and balloon out, leading to chest pain and shortness of breath. In most cases, takotsubo cardiomyopathy resolves on its own within a few weeks, but it can be life-threatening in some cases.

The gold standard for diagnosing takotsubo cardiomyopathy is coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into an artery in the groin and guides it up to the heart. The catheter is then used to inject a dye into the coronary arteries, which allows the doctor to see if there are any blockages.

In the case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, coronary angiography will typically show that the coronary arteries are normal. This helps to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as coronary artery disease.

In addition to coronary angiography, the patient in this case may also need to undergo other tests, such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. MRI is a test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the heart and other organs. These tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and assess the extent of the damage to the left ventricle.

The treatment for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is supportive. This includes measures such as rest, oxygen therapy, and medications to control blood pressure and heart rate. In most cases, the patient will make a full recovery within a few weeks. However, some patients may experience long-term problems, such as heart failure.

Echocardiography in 2 weeks to confirm Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not the correct answer because it would not provide any additional information that would not already be available from the patient's history, physical examination, and initial laboratory tests. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and her initial laboratory tests are normal. Therefore, there is no need to perform an echocardiography in 2 weeks to confirm the diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging to rule out myocarditis vs ischemia is not the correct answer because myocarditis and ischemia are both possible causes of the patient's symptoms. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, and ischemia is a condition in which the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen. Both myocarditis and ischemia can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and electrocardiographic changes. Therefore, it is not possible to rule out myocarditis or ischemia based on the patient's history, physical examination, and initial laboratory tests.

Computed tomographic coronary angiography is not the correct answer because it is not necessary to diagnose takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography is only necessary to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as coronary artery disease. In the case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, coronary angiography will typically show that the coronary arteries are normal.

Epidermoid cysts are the most common type of cyst, and they are usually found on the head, neck, and trunk. They are typically small, round, and filled with a cheesy white material. Dermoid cysts are less common than epidermoid cysts, and they are usually found on the head and neck. They are typically larger than epidermoid cysts, and they can contain hair, teeth, and other skin tissues. Chondromas are tumors that arise from cartilage, and they are most commonly found in the bones. They are typically slow-growing and benign, but they can sometimes become malignant. Solitary cutaneous myxomas are rare tumors that arise from the connective tissue, and they are most commonly found on the skin. They are typically small, round, and soft, and they can be either benign or malignant.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 50s who presented with a 5-year history of a slow-growing mass on the posterior surface of the left auricle. The mass was described as being solitary, 1-cm, dome-shaped, glistening, flesh-colored, and adherent to the posterior groove of the concha ridge. There were no abnormal pigmented skin lesions on the rest of his body, including the face, trunk, and extremities. Neither a palpable thyroid nodule nor enlargement of hands and feet was identified. Surgical excision was performed, and the histopathological examination revealed the tumor to be overall hypocellular and composed of bland spindle cells with no mitotic activity in a slightly basophilic myxoid matrix. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of solitary cutaneous myxoma.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Epidermoid cysts are typically small, round, and filled with a cheesy white material. Dermoid cysts are typically larger than epidermoid cysts, and they can contain hair, teeth, and other skin tissues. Chondromas are tumors that arise from cartilage, and they are most commonly found in the bones.

 64%|██████▎   | 971/1525 [3:58:11<2:03:11, 13.34s/it]The correct answer is D. Osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a bone disorder caused by excessive levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands that helps to regulate blood calcium levels. When PTH levels are too high, it can cause bones to become weak and brittle.

The patient in the case presented with a clinically significant elevation in serum calcium level to (14.1 mg/dL [reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL]) found on routine laboratory tests. This finding is consistent with hypercalcemia, which is a high blood calcium level. Hypercalcemia is a common finding in patients with osteitis fibrosa cystica.

The patient also had a significantly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level at 1377 pg/mL (reference range, 10-65 pg/mL). This finding is also consistent with osteitis fibrosa cystica.

The patient's physical examination was within normal limits. He did not have any palpable thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy. These findings are not consistent with parathyroid carcinoma, multiple myeloma, or primary bone tumor.

A technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan was obtained, which identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, measured at 2.2 cm. This finding is consistent with osteitis fibrosa cystica.

In addition, CT showed associated lytic bone lesions of the left mandibular ramus, left scapula, and C5 vertebra. These findings are also consistent with osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare cancer of the parathyroid glands. It is characterized by a rapidly rising serum calcium level and a palpable mass in the neck. The patient in the case does not have a rapidly rising serum calcium level or a palpable mass in the neck. Therefore, parathyroid carcinoma is not the most likely diagnosis.

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells. It is characterized by a high blood level of myeloma protein, bone pain, and anemia. The patient in the case does not have a high blood level of myeloma protein, bone pain, or anemia. Therefore, multiple myeloma is not the most likely diagnosis.

Primary bone tumor is a tumor that originates in the bone. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and a mass in the affected bone. The patient in the case does not have pain, swelling, or a mass in the affected bone. Therefore, primary bone tumor is not the most likely diagnosis.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that can affect any organ system, but most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and heart. It is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms or findings consistent with sarcoidosis, such as pulmonary infiltrates, hilar lymphadenopathy, or skin lesions.

Respiratory papillomatosis is a viral infection of the respiratory tract that can cause benign tumors to grow on the vocal cords, trachea, and bronchi. It is most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. The patient in this case is a young boy, which is a risk factor for respiratory papillomatosis. However, the patient does not have any symptoms or findings consistent with respiratory papillomatosis, such as hoarseness, stridor, or wheezing.

Metastatic neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in the adrenal glands. It is the most common cancer in infants and young children. Metastatic neuroblastoma can spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs, bones, and brain. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms or findings consistent with metastatic neuroblastoma, such as bone pain, abdominal pain, or headache.

Multifocal granular cell tumor is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but most commonly affects the skin, larynx, and oral cavity. It is composed of a mixture of Schwann cells and histiocytes. The patient in this case has two laryngeal lesions that are consistent with multifocal granular cell tumors. The histopathologic examination of the lesions showed mucosal infiltration by a monotonous population of cells with round nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm, positive for S-100 and lightly positive for CD68, with occasional interspersed more darkly staining cells, consistent with histiocytes and giant cells. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multifocal granular cell tumor.

An esophageal bronchus is a rare congenital anomaly in which a bronchus arises from the esophagus instead of the trachea. This can cause recurrent pneumonia and aspiration, as in the case of the patient described in the question.

Pulmonary sequestration is a congenital anomaly in which a portion of the lung is non-functional and does not communicate with the tracheobronchial tree. This can cause recurrent pneumonia, but it is not associated with aspiration.

Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation is a congenital anomaly in which there are multiple cysts in the lung. This can cause recurrent pneumonia, but it is not associated with aspiration.

Tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital anomaly in which there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. This can cause aspiration, but it is not associated with recurrent pneumonia.

The patient has a history of recurrent orbital pain, with new-onset visual loss and cranial neuropathies. The initial diagnosis was nonspecific orbital inflammation, but the patient's condition has worsened despite treatment with IV methylprednisolone. A repeat biopsy of the orbital apex and sinuses is the most appropriate next step to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and to guide further management.

A repeat IV methylprednisolone course with a slower taper is not the correct answer because the patient has already received a 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone, and her condition has worsened despite treatment. A steroid-sparing immunomodulator is not the correct answer because the patient has not had a response to steroids. Broad-spectrum IV antibacterials are not the correct answer because the patient has already been treated with IV antibacterials, and her condition has worsened despite treatment.

A repeat biopsy of the orbital apex and sinuses is the most appropriate next step to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and to guide further management. The biopsy may reveal a neoplasm, infection, or other inflammatory condition. The results of the biopsy will help to determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

The patient has a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface. This is a serious complication of canaloplasty. The blood in the interface can cause inflammation and scarring, which can lead to vision loss. A saline washout is a procedure that can be used to remove the blood from the interface. It is a safe and effective procedure that can help to improve vision in patients with Descemet membrane detachment.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A (Continue to observe) is incorrect because the patient has a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface. This is a serious complication that requires treatment.
* Choice C (Take the patient to the operating room for an alteplase washout with an air bubble) is incorrect because alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that is used to dissolve blood clots. It is not indicated for the treatment of Descemet membrane detachment.
* Choice D (Laser Descemet membrane membranotomy) is incorrect because laser Descemet membrane membranotomy is a procedure that is used to treat Descemet membrane detachment that is caused by trauma.

The patient has a posteriorly dislocated crystalline lens suspended in the vitreous cavity in her right eye. This is a complication of Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. The lens is normally held in place by the zonules, which are fibers that connect the lens to the ciliary body. In Marfan syndrome, the zonules can weaken and break, causing the lens to dislocate.

A posteriorly dislocated lens can cause a number of problems, including blurred vision, pain, and photophobia. In some cases, it can also lead to glaucoma, a condition in which the pressure inside the eye becomes too high.

The treatment for a posteriorly dislocated lens depends on the severity of the problem. In mild cases, the patient may be able to manage their symptoms with medication and lifestyle changes. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lens.

In this case, the patient is experiencing acute eye pain, which is a sign that the pressure inside her eye is too high. The first step in treatment is to lower the pressure inside the eye. This can be done with medication, such as beta blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

In addition to lowering the pressure inside the eye, it is also important to prevent the lens from rubbing against the cornea. This can be done by instilling atropine, which is a medication that dilates the pupil and prevents the lens from moving.

Finally, the patient should be placed in a supine position. This will help to keep the lens from moving and further irritating the eye.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not be effective in treating the patient's condition.

Laser iridotomy is a procedure that is used to create a small opening in the iris, the colored part of the eye. This procedure is used to treat glaucoma, but it would not be helpful in this case because the patient's glaucoma is caused by a posteriorly dislocated lens, not by an increase in pressure inside the eye.

An emergent pars plana vitrectomy/lensectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove the lens from the eye. This procedure is used to treat a variety of conditions, including glaucoma, but it would not be helpful in this case because the patient's glaucoma is caused by a posteriorly dislocated lens, not by a problem with the lens itself.

Pilocarpine is a medication that is used to constrict the pupil. This medication would not be helpful in this case because it would not lower the pressure inside the eye or prevent the lens from rubbing against the cornea.

 64%|██████▍   | 977/1525 [3:59:38<2:12:27, 14.50s/it]The correct answer is D: Fluorescein angiography.

A complete blood count and coagulation testing would not be helpful in this case because the patient has no history of bleeding disorders or anemia. Oral and topical corticosteroids are not indicated for diffuse retinal hemorrhages after uncomplicated glaucoma drainage implantation. Plasmapheresis is a treatment for hyperviscosity syndrome, which is a rare condition that is not typically associated with diffuse retinal hemorrhages after uncomplicated glaucoma drainage implantation.

Fluorescein angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye conditions, including diffuse retinal hemorrhages. In this case, fluorescein angiography would be helpful to determine the cause of the hemorrhages and to assess the extent of the damage to the retina.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* A: Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing. A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a test that measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. A coagulation test is a test that measures the ability of the blood to clot. These tests would not be helpful in this case because the patient has no history of bleeding disorders or anemia.
* B: Oral and topical corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids are medications that reduce inflammation. Topical corticosteroids are medications that are applied to the surface of the eye to reduce inflammation. These medications are not indicated for diffuse retinal hemorrhages after uncomplicated glaucoma drainage implantation.
* C: Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma or albumin. It is a treatment for hyperviscosity syndrome, which is a rare condition that is not typically associated with diffuse retinal hemorrhages after uncomplicated glaucoma drainage implantation.
* D: Fluorescein angiography. Fluorescein angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye conditions, including diffuse retinal hemorrhages. In this case, fluorescein angiography would be helpful to determine the cause of the hemorrhages and to assess the extent of the damage to the retina.

 64%|██████▍   | 978/1525 [3:59:48<1:59:27, 13.10s/it]The correct diagnosis is small-bowel adenocarcinoma. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient's history of hypochromic microcytic anemia, which is a common finding in small-bowel adenocarcinoma.
* The results of the capsule endoscopy, which showed an intraluminal hypodense mass in the mid-jejunum. This is a characteristic finding of small-bowel adenocarcinoma.
* The results of the contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography, which showed a small-bowel obstruction with a transition zone located at the mid-jejunum. This is also a characteristic finding of small-bowel adenocarcinoma.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphoma of the small bowel is a rare disease that is more common in people who are immunocompromised. The patient in this case has no history of immunosuppression.
* Carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that is more common in the small intestine than in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. However, carcinoid tumors are usually not associated with small-bowel obstruction.
* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the small bowel is a rare type of tumor that is usually not associated with small-bowel obstruction.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is small-bowel adenocarcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history, the results of the capsule endoscopy, and the results of the contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography. The other choices are incorrect for the reasons stated above.

 64%|██████▍   | 979/1525 [4:00:04<2:07:52, 14.05s/it]The correct diagnosis is cecal diverticulitis. The patient's history of colicky abdominal pain that worsened over time and was associated with nausea and vomiting is consistent with diverticulitis. The physical examination findings of tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant are also consistent with diverticulitis. The laboratory findings of an elevated white blood cell count and an elevated C-reactive protein level are further supportive of a diagnosis of diverticulitis. The plain radiograph of the abdomen was negative for air-fluid levels and for signs of perforation, which makes cecal carcinoma and retrocecal acute appendicitis less likely. The ultrasonographic images show thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins, which are consistent with diverticulitis.

Cecal carcinoma is a rare cancer that typically occurs in older adults. It is characterized by a mass in the cecum that can cause abdominal pain, obstruction, and bleeding. The patient in this case is in his early 30s, which makes cecal carcinoma less likely.

Retrocecal acute appendicitis is a type of appendicitis in which the appendix is located behind the cecum. It is characterized by abdominal pain that is typically located in the right lower quadrant, but it can also be located in the back or flank. The patient in this case has abdominal pain that is located in the right lower quadrant, which makes retrocecal acute appendicitis less likely.

Terminal ileitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the terminal ileum. It is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, which makes terminal ileitis less likely.

 64%|██████▍   | 980/1525 [4:00:21<2:13:59, 14.75s/it]The correct diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Here are the reasons why:

* The patient is an elderly woman with a rapidly enlarging scalp mass. This is a common presentation for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system.
* The patient also has progressive generalized weakness, slowed speech, and focal right-handed weakness. These symptoms are consistent with a neurological disorder, such as a brain tumor.
* The brain MRI shows a large enhancing left frontal-parietal mass extending both extracranially and intracranially into the superior sagittal sinus. This is a characteristic finding of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
* The CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis reveal a ground-glass sclerotic lesion of the right sacrum. This is another characteristic finding of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
* The ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Meningioma is a type of tumor that arises from the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults. Meningiomas are usually slow-growing and benign, but they can sometimes be malignant.

Glioblastoma multiforme is a type of brain tumor that is made up of a mixture of different cell types. It is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor in adults. Glioblastoma multiforme is usually fatal, with a median survival of 14 months.

Meningeal sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the meninges. It is usually a fast-growing tumor that is difficult to treat. Meningeal sarcoma has a poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than 1 year.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy results.

 64%|██████▍   | 981/1525 [4:00:37<2:17:26, 15.16s/it]The correct answer is B. Initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes zoster, or shingles. Shingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body. In some people, the virus can reactivate later in life and cause shingles.

Shingles typically presents with a painful rash that occurs in a single dermatome, or skin area supplied by a single nerve. The rash often starts with a burning or tingling sensation in the area, followed by the development of small, fluid-filled blisters. The blisters typically crust over and heal within a few weeks.

Antiviral medications are the most effective treatment for shingles. Valacyclovir is one of the most commonly used antiviral medications for shingles. It is taken orally and can help to shorten the duration of the rash and reduce the severity of the pain.

Blood cultures are not necessary for the diagnosis of shingles. The diagnosis is typically made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Blood cultures may be ordered to rule out other possible causes of the rash, such as bacterial infection.

Oral antihistamine agents are not effective for the treatment of shingles. They may be helpful for relieving the itching associated with the rash, but they will not shorten the course of the disease or reduce the severity of the pain.

Topical corticosteroid creams are not effective for the treatment of shingles. They may be helpful for relieving the itching associated with the rash, but they can actually prolong the course of the disease and increase the risk of complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir.

 64%|██████▍   | 982/1525 [4:00:53<2:19:20, 15.40s/it]The correct answer is A. Avoid further ibuprofen use and prescribe a topical steroid.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a rare but well-described drug reaction. AGEP typically presents with fever, a generalized pruritic rash, and subcorneal pustules. The rash often begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. Ibuprofen is a known trigger for AGEP.

The laboratory findings are consistent with an inflammatory process. The elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level suggest an acute inflammatory response. The Gram stain and cultures are negative, ruling out an infectious cause. The biopsy findings are also consistent with AGEP.

The treatment for AGEP is to stop the offending medication and to treat the symptoms with topical steroids and oral antihistamines. In severe cases, systemic steroids may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. It is not indicated for the treatment of AGEP.
* C. Cephalexin is an antibiotic. It is not indicated for the treatment of AGEP, which is a non-infectious condition.
* D. An HIV immunoassay is not indicated in this patient because there is no clinical evidence of HIV infection.

 64%|██████▍   | 983/1525 [4:01:02<2:03:16, 13.65s/it]The correct answer is "Obtain a brain biopsy." This is because the patient has a number of clinical features that are suggestive of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), including:

* A history of HIV infection
* A CD4 cell count of 73/mm3
* A brain mass lesion with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle
* Absence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies

PCNSL is a rare but aggressive type of lymphoma that affects the central nervous system. It is most commonly seen in patients with HIV infection, and is often associated with a CD4 cell count of less than 200/mm3. The diagnosis of PCNSL is made by biopsy of the brain lesion. Treatment typically consists of a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* "Begin antiretroviral therapy (ART)": ART is not indicated for the treatment of PCNSL. However, it is important to begin ART in all patients with HIV infection, regardless of the presence of PCNSL. This is because ART can help to improve the immune system and reduce the risk of opportunistic infections.
* "Perform a lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)": A lumbar puncture may be performed to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as meningitis or encephalitis. However, it is not necessary for the diagnosis of PCNSL.
* "Start treatment for central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis": Treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis is indicated in patients with HIV infection who have a positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody test. However, the patient in this case does not have a positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody test, and therefore does not have CNS toxoplasmosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is "Obtain a brain biopsy." This is because the patient has a number of clinical features that are suggestive of PCNSL, and a brain biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis of PCNSL.

 65%|██████▍   | 984/1525 [4:01:19<2:11:43, 14.61s/it]The correct answer is B. Methimazole-induced vasculitis.

Methimazole-induced vasculitis is a rare but serious side effect of methimazole, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to skin lesions, ulcers, and other problems.

The patient in the case report presented with several features that are consistent with methimazole-induced vasculitis. These include:

* Painful lesions on both legs
* Chills
* Bilateral lower extremity swelling
* Several small, painful, “pimple-like bumps” appearing on her bilateral lower legs, which ulcerated several days later
* Progression of the ulcers despite a recent course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for cultures growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
* Medication history that included methimazole and atenolol, which she had been taking since her diagnosis of Graves disease 1 year prior
* Physical examination findings of pitting edema and multiple discrete, round, dry ulcers, most with central eschars, dusky gray borders, and collarettes of scale
* Laboratory findings of elevated levels of C-reactive protein and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate
* Histopathological findings of a mid- and deep dermal marked lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and focal abscess, suggesting a nonspecific infection

In addition, the patient's symptoms began shortly after she started taking methimazole, which is a known risk factor for methimazole-induced vasculitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can affect any organ system, but it is most commonly seen in the kidneys, heart, and skin. The patient in the case report did not have any evidence of systemic involvement, and her symptoms were limited to her lower extremities.
* Ecthyma is a bacterial infection of the skin that is characterized by a deep ulcer with a raised border. The patient in the case report did not have any evidence of infection, and her ulcers were not deep or associated with a raised border.
* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic skin condition that is characterized by painful ulcers that often have a necrotic center. The patient in the case report did not have any evidence of necrosis, and her ulcers were not painful.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is methimazole-induced vasculitis.

EPP is a rare, autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in the red blood cells, plasma, and tissues. This leads to photosensitivity, which is the skin's reaction to sunlight. The most common symptoms of EPP are itching, burning, and pain in the skin after exposure to sunlight. Other symptoms may include blistering, swelling, and rashes.

EPP is diagnosed with a blood test to measure the levels of protoporphyrin IX. Treatment for EPP is aimed at reducing the amount of protoporphyrin IX in the body and preventing photosensitivity. This may include avoiding sunlight, using sunscreen, and taking medication.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms or findings.

Nodular amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid protein in the body. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including swelling, pain, and organ failure. Nodular amyloidosis is not associated with photosensitivity.

Colloid milium is a rare skin condition characterized by the formation of small, white papules on the skin. The papules are caused by the accumulation of colloid, a type of protein, in the skin. Colloid milium is not associated with photosensitivity.

Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipids in the skin, blood vessels, and other organs. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, seizures, and mental retardation. Lipoid proteinosis is not associated with photosensitivity.

 65%|██████▍   | 986/1525 [4:01:47<2:04:49, 13.90s/it]The correct diagnosis is atypical hand-foot-mouth disease. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. CLL patients are at increased risk for developing atypical hand-foot-mouth disease.
* The patient developed a fever, cough, and rhinorrhea 2 weeks prior to the onset of the rash. These symptoms are consistent with an upper respiratory infection, which is a common precursor to atypical hand-foot-mouth disease.
* The patient subsequently developed small, pruritic blisters on the hands and feet. This is the classic presentation of atypical hand-foot-mouth disease.
* The patient's rash spread to the arms, legs, and face. This is also consistent with atypical hand-foot-mouth disease.
* The patient's laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell count of 25,600/μL, which is elevated. This finding is consistent with an inflammatory process, such as that seen in atypical hand-foot-mouth disease.
* The Tzanck smear from the initial lesion was negative for multinucleated giant cells. This finding is consistent with atypical hand-foot-mouth disease, in which multinucleated giant cells are not typically seen.
* The punch biopsy showed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional eosinophils. This finding is also consistent with atypical hand-foot-mouth disease.

Disseminated zoster is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have a history of chickenpox. In addition, the patient's rash does not have the characteristic dermatomal distribution of disseminated zoster.

Erythema multiforme is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have the characteristic target lesions of erythema multiforme. In addition, the patient's rash does not have the mucosal involvement that is often seen in erythema multiforme.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have the characteristic purpuric rash of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In addition, the patient's rash does not have the systemic symptoms, such as fever and arthralgia, that are often seen in leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

The patient presented with progressive difficulty walking, hearing problems, and cognitive decline. These symptoms are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder. The disease is caused by a prion, a misfolded protein that can replicate itself and damage brain cells. There is no cure for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms. The disease is usually fatal within a year of diagnosis.

Paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is a type of ataxia that is caused by a cancer that produces antibodies that attack the cerebellum. The patient in the case does not have a history of cancer, and there is no evidence of cancer on his imaging studies. Therefore, paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is an unlikely diagnosis.

Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. The patient in the case does not have any of the characteristic features of this disorder, so it is an unlikely diagnosis.

Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder that is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). It is most commonly seen in people who have alcoholism or who have been malnourished for a long period of time. The patient in the case does not have any of the risk factors for Wernicke encephalopathy, so it is an unlikely diagnosis.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case. The patient's symptoms are consistent with the disease, and there is no evidence of other possible causes.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with HDLS. She has a progressive dementia with personality changes, executive dysfunction, motor and memory impairment. She also has a family history of the disease. The MRI findings of scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter affecting the corpus callosum, bifrontal, and biparietal regions, associated with bifrontal and bitemporal atrophy are also consistent with HDLS.

The other choices are incorrect. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive damage to the small blood vessels in the brain. It typically presents with stroke-like episodes, dementia, and mood changes. Adrenoleukodystrophy is an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal glands and the central nervous system. It typically presents in childhood with adrenal insufficiency, seizures, and progressive neurological deterioration. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disorder that causes seizures, stroke-like episodes, and lactic acidosis. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS). The patient's history and presentation are consistent with the disease, and the MRI findings are also consistent with HDLS. The other choices are incorrect.

 65%|██████▍   | 989/1525 [4:02:37<2:20:38, 15.74s/it]The correct answer is B. Pediculosis corporis.

Pediculosis corporis is an infestation of the body by the human body louse, Pediculus humanus corporis. The lice live in clothing and bedding, and they attach themselves to the skin to feed on blood. The bite of the louse causes an itchy rash.

The patient in the case presented with a diffuse truncal rash concerning for a drug rash given the initiation of several antibiotics during his hospital stay. However, the rash was not associated with any other symptoms of a drug rash, such as fever, rash on other parts of the body, or lymphadenopathy. The rash was also not consistent with the typical presentation of a drug rash, which is usually a morbilliform rash (a rash with flat, red spots).

The patient's history was also significant for a recent exposure to head lice. His cousin had received a diagnosis of chicken pox 6 months prior, but had persistent skin lesions and pruritus. His mother had several pruritic pink papules on her bilateral forearms, which she suspected were from sand fleas. Head lice are a common cause of pediculosis capitis, an infestation of the head by the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis. Head lice are spread through close contact with people who have head lice. The patient's history of exposure to head lice, his mother's history of pruritic pink papules on her bilateral forearms, and the appearance of the rash on the patient's trunk are all consistent with a diagnosis of pediculosis corporis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Drug rash: The rash in the patient was not associated with any other symptoms of a drug rash, such as fever, rash on other parts of the body, or lymphadenopathy. The rash was also not consistent with the typical presentation of a drug rash, which is usually a morbilliform rash (a rash with flat, red spots).
* Leukemia cutis: Leukemia cutis is a rare condition in which leukemia cells infiltrate the skin. The patient's rash was not consistent with the typical presentation of leukemia cutis, which is usually a rash with multiple red, raised lesions.
* Varicella-zoster virus infection: Varicella-zoster virus infection is the cause of chicken pox. The patient's cousin had received a diagnosis of chicken pox 6 months prior, but the patient did not have any history of chicken pox. The patient's rash was also not consistent with the typical presentation of chicken pox, which is usually a rash with multiple red, raised lesions.

 65%|██████▍   | 990/1525 [4:02:54<2:23:13, 16.06s/it]The correct answer is B: Obtain cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A tilt table test is a procedure used to diagnose vasovagal syncope, a type of fainting caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure. The test involves lying flat on a table that is then tilted upright. If the patient faints, the test is positive for vasovagal syncope. However, the patient in this case did not faint during the tilt table test, so it is unlikely that vasovagal syncope is the cause of his syncope.

A dual chamber pacemaker is a device that is implanted in the chest to regulate the heart rate. It is used to treat conditions such as bradycardia, a slow heart rate. However, the patient in this case has a normal resting heart rate, so a dual chamber pacemaker is not necessary.

An implantable loop recorder is a small device that is implanted under the skin to monitor the heart rhythm. It is used to diagnose arrhythmias, abnormal heart rhythms. However, the patient in this case already had an exercise stress echocardiography, which showed no evidence of arrhythmias. Therefore, an implantable loop recorder is not necessary.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart. It is the most accurate test for diagnosing cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle. In this case, the patient's exercise stress echocardiography showed evidence of AV block, which is a type of arrhythmia. Cardiac MRI is the best test to confirm the diagnosis of AV block and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's syncope.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B: Obtain cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

 65%|██████▍   | 991/1525 [4:03:10<2:23:31, 16.13s/it]The correct answer is B. McCune-Albright syndrome.

McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a rare, genetic disorder that affects multiple endocrine glands, including the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands. It is characterized by the triad of café-au-lait spots, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and precocious puberty.

The café-au-lait spots are typically large, irregular, and light brown in color. They can be present at birth or develop during infancy. The polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is a disorder of bone growth that causes areas of the bone to become enlarged and deformed. The precocious puberty is the development of secondary sexual characteristics at an early age.

MAS is caused by a mutation in the GNAS1 gene. This gene is responsible for producing a protein called Gsα, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and function. The mutation in GNAS1 causes Gsα to be overactive, which leads to the development of the features of MAS.

There is no cure for MAS, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include surgery to correct bone deformities, hormone replacement therapy to treat precocious puberty, and medication to control the growth of fibrous dysplasia.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain all of the features of the case. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a disorder of the immune system that causes the accumulation of white blood cells called Langerhans cells in tissues throughout the body. Juvenile Paget disease is a disorder of bone growth that causes the bones to become enlarged and deformed. Ossifying fibromas are benign tumors of bone that can cause pain and swelling.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. McCune-Albright syndrome. This is because the case presents with all three of the classic features of MAS: café-au-lait spots, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and precocious puberty. The other answer choices do not explain all of the features of the case.

A glioma is a type of brain tumor that starts in the glial cells, which support and protect the nerve cells in the brain. Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults.

A neuromuscular hamartoma is a rare, benign (noncancerous) tumor that occurs in the muscles and nerves. It is usually found in the arms or legs, but it can also occur in the head and neck.

A rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that starts in the skeletal muscle. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children.

A rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma is a rare, benign (noncancerous) tumor that occurs in the soft tissues. It is made up of a mixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures.

In the case of the infant girl, the history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma. The mass was a well-defined, nontender mass over the nasal dorsum. The histopathologic images showed a disordered admixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures. These findings are all characteristic of a rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the infant girl. A glioma is a type of brain tumor, but the infant girl's mass was located on the nasal dorsum. A neuromuscular hamartoma is a rare, benign (noncancerous) tumor that occurs in the muscles and nerves, but the infant girl's mass was not located in the muscles or nerves. A rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma, but the infant girl's mass was benign (noncancerous).

Amyloidosis is a disease in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including hoarseness, but it is not typically associated with chalky white lesions.

Rheumatoid nodules are small, firm lumps that can form on the hands, feet, and other joints. They are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but they are not typically associated with chalky white lesions.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the larynx. It is not typically associated with chalky white lesions.

Laryngeal gout is a rare condition that occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the larynx. It is most commonly seen in men who have a history of gout. Symptoms include hoarseness, pain, and difficulty swallowing.

The patient in the case presented with a history of gout, hoarseness, and a chalky white lesion on the bilateral true vocal folds. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal gout. The histopathologic findings of submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material and needle-shaped birefringent crystals on an unstained slide are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Amyloidosis, rheumatoid nodules, and squamous cell carcinoma are all possible diagnoses in a patient with hoarseness and a chalky white lesion on the vocal folds. However, the patient's history of gout, the location of the lesion, and the histopathologic findings are all more consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal gout.

 65%|██████▌   | 994/1525 [4:03:58<2:22:12, 16.07s/it]The correct answer is B. Dermoid cyst.

A dermoid cyst is a benign (noncancerous) growth that forms when skin cells become trapped in the body during embryonic development. These cysts can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region.

Dermoid cysts are typically filled with a mixture of hair, sebum, and keratin (the protein that makes up skin). They are usually soft and nontender, and they may grow slowly over time.

The most common symptom of a dermoid cyst is a painless swelling on the skin. The swelling may be small or large, and it may be located anywhere on the body. Other symptoms may include pain, redness, and infection.

Diagnosis of a dermoid cyst is usually made based on a physical examination and imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the cyst.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Foregut duplication cyst: Foregut duplication cysts are rare congenital malformations that can occur anywhere along the foregut, which includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. These cysts are usually lined with epithelial cells and may contain fluid, mucus, or other tissue. Symptoms of foregut duplication cysts vary depending on the location of the cyst and may include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the cyst.
* Sublingual abscess: A sublingual abscess is a collection of pus that forms under the tongue. These abscesses are usually caused by infection with bacteria such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. Symptoms of sublingual abscess include pain, swelling, redness, and fever. Treatment typically involves incision and drainage of the abscess, followed by antibiotic therapy.
* Thyroglossal duct cyst: Thyroglossal duct cysts are congenital malformations that arise from the remnants of the thyroglossal duct, which is a structure that forms during embryonic development and normally disappears by the time of birth. These cysts are usually located in the midline of the neck, just above the thyroid gland. Symptoms of thyroglossal duct cysts include a painless swelling in the neck that may increase in size with swallowing or talking. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the cyst.

 65%|██████▌   | 995/1525 [4:04:14<2:22:37, 16.15s/it]The correct answer is B. Observation with normal follow-up.

The patient is a visually asymptomatic Hispanic man in his early 20s with a dark retinal lesion in his left eye that was initially discovered 4 years prior. The lesion is non-progressive and has not caused any visual symptoms. The patient has no history of ocular trauma or systemic disease. The physical examination and imaging are unremarkable.

In this case, the most appropriate management is observation with normal follow-up. The lesion is small, non-progressive, and asymptomatic. There is no evidence of retinal traction or other signs of malignancy. Surgical excision and histopathologic analysis are not necessary at this time. Staging workup is also not necessary, as there is no evidence of systemic disease.

The patient should be instructed to return for follow-up examinations every 6-12 months. If the lesion changes in size, appearance, or causes visual symptoms, then further management may be necessary.

Here are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Genetic testing is not necessary in this case because the lesion is non-progressive and asymptomatic. There is no evidence of a genetic disorder.
* Surgical excision and histopathologic analysis are not necessary in this case because the lesion is small, non-progressive, and asymptomatic. There is no evidence of malignancy.
* Staging workup is also not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of systemic disease.

The patient in this case presents with bilateral optic nerve head changes, which could be caused by a variety of conditions, including:

* Ischemic optic neuropathy
* Optic neuritis
* Papilledema
* Central retinal vein occlusion
* Central retinal artery occlusion

In order to determine the underlying cause of the patient's optic nerve head changes, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical examination. The history should focus on any recent changes in vision, as well as any associated symptoms, such as headache, fever, or weight gain. The physical examination should include a careful evaluation of the optic nerves, as well as a search for other signs of systemic disease.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are non-specific. The patient denies any recent changes in vision, as well as any associated symptoms. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for the bilateral optic nerve head changes.

In order to further evaluate the patient, it is appropriate to order serum and urine testing for various inflammatory and infectious processes. This testing will help to identify any underlying systemic disease that may be causing the patient's optic nerve head changes.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Observation with close follow-up is not appropriate in this case because the patient's optic nerve head changes could be caused by a serious underlying condition.
* Lumbar puncture is not appropriate in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms that would suggest a central nervous system infection.
* Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging is not appropriate in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms that would suggest a mass lesion in the orbit or brain.

 65%|██████▌   | 997/1525 [4:04:39<2:06:01, 14.32s/it]The correct answer is C: Biopsy the eyelid.

The patient has a history of basal cell carcinoma that was resected from the right medial canthus. He now presents with right-sided ptosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and recurrent central corneal erosions. These findings are concerning for a recurrent or metastatic basal cell carcinoma.

A biopsy of the eyelid is the most definitive way to diagnose a recurrent or metastatic basal cell carcinoma. Doxycycline and tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment are both treatment options for blepharitis, but they would not be effective in treating a recurrent or metastatic basal cell carcinoma. Repairing the ptosis would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A: Initiate treatment with doxycycline. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. In this case, the patient does not have a bacterial infection, so doxycycline would not be an effective treatment.
* B: Increase the frequency of tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment. Tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment is a combination of an antibiotic and a corticosteroid. It is used to treat bacterial infections and inflammation. In this case, the patient does not have a bacterial infection, so tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment would not be an effective treatment. Additionally, the use of corticosteroids can mask the symptoms of a neoplasm, so it is important to rule out a neoplasm before starting treatment with a corticosteroid.
* C: Biopsy the eyelid. A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. It is the most definitive way to diagnose a neoplasm. In this case, the patient has a history of basal cell carcinoma, so a biopsy is necessary to rule out a recurrence or metastasis.
* D: Repair his ptosis. Ptosis is a drooping of the upper eyelid. It can be caused by a number of conditions, including aging, nerve damage, and tumors. In this case, the patient's ptosis is likely due to the underlying neoplasm. Repairing the ptosis would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Biopsy the eyelid.

 65%|██████▌   | 998/1525 [4:04:49<1:53:36, 12.93s/it]The correct answer is B. Order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

A lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case because the patient's visual acuity is preserved. Lumbar puncture is typically used to diagnose meningitis, which is a serious infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. In this case, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, optic nerve sheath meningioma, and giant cell arteritis. Bloodwork and magnetic resonance imaging can help to diagnose the underlying cause of optic neuritis.

Bloodwork can be used to measure the levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. An elevated white blood cell count can be a sign of infection. An elevated red blood cell count can be a sign of anemia. A low platelet count can be a sign of thrombocytopenia.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a test that measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a test tube. An elevated ESR can be a sign of inflammation.

The C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that is produced by the liver in response to inflammation. An elevated CRP level can be a sign of infection or inflammation.

The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test is a test for syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause inflammation of the optic nerve.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) test is a test for sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs, eyes, skin, and other organs.

The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a test for autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are diseases in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. MRI can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, optic nerve sheath meningioma, and giant cell arteritis.

Molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is not necessary in this case because the patient's age and history are not consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a genetic disorder that causes inflammation and degeneration of the optic nerve. It typically affects men in their 20s and 30s.

Order computed tomography (CT) of the orbits is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a mass lesion in the orbit. CT can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including tumors, infections, and inflammation.

 66%|██████▌   | 999/1525 [4:05:05<2:02:33, 13.98s/it]The correct answer is B. Foreign body ingestion. The patient's history of appendectomy and the presence of calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis on abdominal computed tomography scan are consistent with a foreign body lodged in the ileum. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

A. Stump appendicitis is a rare condition that occurs when the stump of the appendix becomes inflamed after an appendectomy. It is usually caused by infection of the stump or by obstruction of the lumen of the stump by a foreign body. The patient's history of appendectomy and the presence of calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis on abdominal computed tomography scan are not consistent with stump appendicitis.

C. Crohn ileitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but it is most commonly found in the small intestine. The patient's history of appendectomy and the presence of calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis on abdominal computed tomography scan are not consistent with Crohn ileitis.

D. Carcinoid is a rare type of cancer that can develop in the neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's history of appendectomy and the presence of calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis on abdominal computed tomography scan are not consistent with carcinoid.

 66%|██████▌   | 1000/1525 [4:05:16<1:53:46, 13.00s/it]The correct answer is C. Inclusion cyst.

A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of mesenchymal tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs are usually benign (noncancerous), but they can be malignant (cancerous). The most common symptom of a GIST is abdominal pain. Other symptoms can include weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. GISTs are diagnosed with imaging tests such as CT scans and MRI scans. Treatment for GISTs depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Options for treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Esophageal carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat to the stomach. Esophageal carcinoma is the seventh most common cancer in the world and the eighth most common cause of cancer death. The most common symptom of esophageal carcinoma is difficulty swallowing. Other symptoms can include chest pain, heartburn, and weight loss. Esophageal carcinoma is diagnosed with imaging tests such as CT scans and MRI scans. Treatment for esophageal carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Options for treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

An inclusion cyst is a type of cyst that forms when tissue is trapped in a body cavity. Inclusion cysts can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the breasts, ovaries, and skin. Inclusion cysts are usually benign (noncancerous), but they can be malignant (cancerous) in rare cases. The most common symptom of an inclusion cyst is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms can include pain, tenderness, and discharge. Inclusion cysts are diagnosed with imaging tests such as CT scans and MRI scans. Treatment for inclusion cysts depends on the size, location, and type of cyst. Options for treatment include surgery, needle aspiration, and laser therapy.

A bronchogenic cyst is a type of cyst that forms in the lungs. Bronchogenic cysts are usually congenital (present at birth), but they can also develop later in life. Bronchogenic cysts are usually benign (noncancerous), but they can be malignant (cancerous) in rare cases. The most common symptom of a bronchogenic cyst is a cough. Other symptoms can include wheezing, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Bronchogenic cysts are diagnosed with imaging tests such as CT scans and MRI scans. Treatment for bronchogenic cysts depends on the size, location, and type of cyst. Options for treatment include surgery, needle aspiration, and laser therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy 43-year-old woman who presented with weight loss, heartburn, and progressively worsening dysphagia to solid food. Intriguingly, the heartburn was most severe while she was sitting up but lying supine relieved the symptoms. Paradoxically, dysphagia was worse while she was reclining and partially resolved in the upright position. The physical examination was normal while laboratory workup revealed mild anemia. She was administered a trial of acid-suppression therapy for 6 weeks, which transiently alleviated heartburn but the dysphagia persisted. Subsequently, further workup with an esophagram revealed a 2.7-cm filling defect at the gastroesophageal junction, suggestive of extrinsic compression. Computed tomography demonstrated a 2.5-cm low-attenuation ovoid lesion at the gastroesophageal junction. Considering a diagnosis of gastric tumor, she then underwent upper endoscopy that showed a mobile smooth-surfaced polypoid subepithelial lesion at the posterolateral wall of the gastroesophageal junction. The mass flopped back and forth into the gastroesophageal junction. Mucosal biopsies were performed, which were consistent with normal squamous mucosal epithelium. Following this, endoscopic ultrasonography was performed, which demonstrated an anechoic, loculated, subepithelial lesion located within the submucosa of the distal esophagus. The endosonographic borders were well defined without invasion into the nearby structures. Manometry and 24-hour pH testing revealed preserved motility but abnormal acid exposure of the distal esophagus. Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas revealed no abnormalities.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is an inclusion cyst. Inclusion cysts are usually benign (noncancerous) and can be treated with surgery, needle aspiration, or laser therapy. GISTs, esophageal carcinoma, and bronchogenic cysts are all malignant (cancerous) tumors that can occur in the esophagus. These tumors are more likely to cause symptoms such as weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They are also more likely to invade nearby structures and spread to other parts of the body. Therefore, these tumors are less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

 66%|██████▌   | 1001/1525 [4:05:33<2:02:57, 14.08s/it]The correct diagnosis is lymphoma. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that can increase the risk of developing lymphoma.
* The patient presents with progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling, which are common symptoms of lymphoma.
* On examination, the patient has craniofacial deformity with left facial preauricular swelling, a firm mass throughout the left preauricular space, expanding into the temporomandibular joint area and zygoma, soft-mobile lymphadenopathy in the left neck, and a firm, adherent, immobile right supraclavicular mass extended under the clavicle. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma.
* Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck show a 3.2 × 4.4 × 2.8-cm lobulated enhancing paramandibular mass extending into the left masticator space and infratemporal fossa, with frank erosion of the left mandibular condyle. This finding is highly suggestive of a lymphoma.
* Computed tomography of the chest shows a 4.6 × 3.2 × 3.5-cm supraclavicular mass with infiltration of the surrounding fat and scalene muscle and extension into the chest wall and axilla. This finding is also consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma.
* Positron emission tomography shows a large metabolically active left masticator space mass (standardized uptake value for body weight at maximum counts per pixel [SUVmax], 18.2) and previously mentioned pathologic nodes. The right supraclavicular mass was also metabolically active (SUVmax, 19.4), and metabolically active right axillary, left mediastinal, and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy was also noted. This finding is highly suggestive of a lymphoma.

In conclusion, the patient's history, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are all consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation as well as lymphoma does.

 66%|██████▌   | 1002/1525 [4:05:49<2:09:16, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is A. Perform a biopsy of skin lesion. The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide enough information to make a diagnosis.

A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue from the body for examination under a microscope. This is the only way to definitively diagnose many skin conditions. In this case, the patient has a scaly plaque on the right shin and mild bilateral erythema of the earlobes, distal fingers, and toes. These findings are consistent with a number of different skin conditions, including psoriasis, lichen planus, and sarcoidosis. A biopsy is necessary to determine the exact diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

Checking rapid plasma reagin (RPR), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and lead level would not provide enough information to make a diagnosis in this case. RPR is a test for syphilis, but the patient does not have any other symptoms of syphilis, such as a rash or genital ulcers. TSH is a test for thyroid function, but the patient does not have any symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, or dry skin. Lead level is a test for lead poisoning, but the patient does not have any symptoms of lead poisoning, such as abdominal pain, constipation, or irritability.

Empirically treating the patient with a topical steroid would be premature without a definitive diagnosis. Topical steroids can be effective in treating a number of different skin conditions, but they can also have serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin and increased risk of infection. It is important to know the exact diagnosis before starting treatment with a topical steroid.

Empirically treating the patient and close contacts with dapsone is not appropriate in this case. Dapsone is a medication that is used to treat a number of different skin conditions, but it is not the first-line treatment for any of the conditions that are consistent with the patient's symptoms. In addition, dapsone can have serious side effects, such as agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells), which can be life-threatening. It is important to know the exact diagnosis before starting treatment with dapsone.

Equestrian perniosis is a common skin condition that affects people who work with horses. It is caused by repeated exposure to cold and wet conditions, and it typically affects the lower legs and feet. The symptoms of equestrian perniosis include redness, swelling, and itching of the skin. In some cases, the skin may also blister and ulcerate.

The diagnosis of equestrian perniosis is based on the patient's history and physical examination. A biopsy of the skin may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for equestrian perniosis, but the symptoms can be treated with a variety of methods, including:

* Keeping the skin warm and dry
* Applying topical corticosteroids
* Taking oral antihistamines
* Avoiding cold and wet conditions

Equestrian perniosis is a self-limiting condition, and the symptoms usually resolve within a few weeks. However, the condition can be recurrent, and some people may experience symptoms for several years.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient.

A. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a skin condition that is characterized by rings of red, scaly skin. It is not caused by exposure to cold and wet conditions, and it does not typically affect the thighs.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non-infectious, skin condition that can cause painful, rapidly-spreading ulcers. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and hematologic malignancies. The most common presentation of pyoderma gangrenosum is a small, erythematous papule that rapidly develops into a necrotic ulcer with undermined edges. The ulcers are typically painful and tender, and they may bleed or discharge pus. There is no specific treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum, but it can be managed with a variety of therapies, including topical steroids, antibiotics, and immune modulators.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not associated with the clinical presentation described in the case. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but these are typically indurated, verrucous papules or nodules. Atypical mycobacterial infections can also cause skin lesions, but these are typically papules or nodules that are not as destructive as the ulcers seen in pyoderma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a bacterial infection that can cause skin ulcers, but these are typically associated with fever, chills, and lymphadenopathy.

Pseudolymphoma is a non-neoplastic condition that can mimic lymphoma clinically and histologically. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the skin. The most common presentation is a solitary nodule or plaque, but it can also present as multiple lesions. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they can be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The treatment is usually excision or radiation therapy.

Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is a chronic, progressive, and disfiguring skin disease that is characterized by the development of warty, verrucous lesions on the lower extremities. The lesions are caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. The disease is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. The diagnosis is made by clinical presentation and skin biopsy. The treatment is with multidrug therapy, which includes rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine.

Plantar cerebriform collagenoma is a rare, benign, cutaneous disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple, small, raised lesions on the soles of the feet. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they can be painful. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows a proliferation of collagen fibers in a cerebriform pattern. The treatment is usually not necessary, but the lesions can be removed surgically if they are symptomatic.

Nodular amyloid is a rare, chronic, and progressive disease that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the skin and other organs. The disease is most common in older adults. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows the accumulation of amyloid protein in the skin and other organs. The treatment is usually with melphalan and prednisone.

The patient in the case presented with an asymptomatic, smooth-surfaced, cobblestoned plaque located in the sulcus between the second and fourth toes. The patient also had diabetes and long-standing, intermittent dyspnea on exertion. The physical examination revealed a 4.5 cm waxy, nontender, smooth-surfaced, cobblestoned plaque located in the sulcus between the second and fourth toes. The biopsy specimen obtained by the patient’s podiatrist was sent to the dermatopathology laboratory for review. The Hemotoxylin-eosin stain (original magnification ×100) results showed a diffuse infiltrate of pale eosinophilic material with prominent clefts. The Congo red stain (original magnification ×200) showed apple-green birefringence. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of nodular amyloid.

The patient in the case presented with all of these symptoms, as well as ecchymosis (bruises), petechiae (small red spots), and edema (swelling) of the lower extremities. These symptoms are consistent with scurvy, as vitamin C is necessary for the production of collagen, a protein that is essential for the health of blood vessels, skin, and bones.

Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is characterized by an increased number of white blood cells, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and bleeding. The patient in the case did not have any of these symptoms, so leukemia is not the most likely diagnosis.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a type of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It is characterized by purpura (purple spots), abdominal pain, and joint pain. The patient in the case did not have any of the symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, so it is not the most likely diagnosis.

Granulomatosis with polyangitis is a type of vasculitis that affects the small blood vessels. It is characterized by fever, weight loss, and anemia. The patient in the case did not have any of the symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangitis, so it is not the most likely diagnosis.

The patient is a man in his 40s who was referred from jail with abdominal pain for 5 days. The pain was constant in the hypogastric region, with no radiation. He did not have bowel movements for 5 days but passed gas normally. He did not complain of nausea or vomiting. He denied substance abuse or addiction.

On examination, the abdomen was soft with hypogastric tenderness. There was no abdominal distension, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Neither hernia nor surgical scars were seen on examination, and vital signs and results from laboratory tests were normal. An axial contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed. The CT scan revealed multiple, well-defined, round, radiopaque densities in the abdomen, consistent with body packing.

Body packing is the concealment of drugs or other contraband in the body for the purpose of smuggling. The most common methods of body packing are ingestion, insertion into the rectum or vagina, and subcutaneous injection. The drugs or contraband are often wrapped in plastic or other materials to prevent them from being absorbed by the body.

Body packing is a dangerous practice that can result in serious complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation, infection, and death. If you suspect that someone is body packing, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.

Adhesive bands are bands of fibrous tissue that can form in the abdomen after surgery or an injury. They can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Adhesive bands are not likely to cause the symptoms described in the case, so they are not the correct diagnosis.

Internal hernias are hernias that occur when a part of the intestine pushes through a weakness in the abdominal wall. They can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Internal hernias are not likely to cause the symptoms described in the case, so they are not the correct diagnosis.

Fecal impaction is a condition in which hard, dry stool becomes lodged in the rectum. It can cause abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea. Fecal impaction is not likely to cause the symptoms described in the case, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

A cavernous lymphangioma is a benign tumor of lymphatic vessels. It is characterized by a soft, spongy mass that is filled with lymph fluid. Cavernous lymphangiomas are most commonly found on the skin, but they can also occur in other organs, such as the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.

A nodular basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the basal cells, which are the cells that produce the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin. Nodular basal cell carcinomas are typically slow-growing and rarely metastasize (spread to other parts of the body). However, they can be locally destructive, and they can be disfiguring if not treated.

A squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the cells that produce the outer layer of the epidermis. Squamous cell carcinomas are more common than basal cell carcinomas, and they are more likely to metastasize.

Nodular melanoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes, which are the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. Nodular melanomas are the most aggressive type of melanoma, and they are the most likely to metastasize.

In the case presented, the patient is a previously healthy, fair-skinned professional golfer aged 69 years with a history of frequent outdoor sun exposure. He presented to the surgery clinic with a mass on his left upper back, which he first noted 1 year ago as a small nodule on his back. It grew rapidly throughout the past year, becoming increasingly painful and bleeding easily with light contact. Clinical examination revealed an 8 × 6 × 4-cm multilobulated, purplish lesion that was fungating and friable. He also had a palpable, hard mass in the left axilla. He had no other lesions elsewhere on his body. A punch biopsy of the back mass revealed immunohistochemistry strongly positive for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45. Computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scans demonstrated a fludeoxyglucose-avid lesion on the back extending into the subcutaneous fat and fludeoxyglucose-avid uptake in the left axilla.

The patient's history of frequent outdoor sun exposure, the rapid growth of the lesion, the purplish color of the lesion, the fungating and friable appearance of the lesion, the presence of a palpable mass in the left axilla, and the positive immunohistochemistry for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 are all consistent with a diagnosis of nodular melanoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cavernous lymphangioma is a benign tumor of lymphatic vessels. It is characterized by a soft, spongy mass that is filled with lymph fluid. Cavernous lymphangiomas are most commonly found on the skin, but they can also occur in other organs, such as the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. In the case presented, the patient has a rapidly growing, purplish lesion on his back that is fungating and friable. These findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous lymphangioma.
* Nodular basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the basal cells, which are the cells that produce the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin. Nodular basal cell carcinomas are typically slow-growing and rarely metastasize (spread to other parts of the body). However, they can be locally destructive, and they can be disfiguring if not treated. In the case presented, the patient has a rapidly growing, purplish lesion on his back that is fungating and friable. These findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of nodular basal cell carcinoma.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the cells that produce the outer layer of the epidermis. Squamous cell carcinomas are more common than basal cell carcinomas, and they are more likely to metastasize. In the case presented, the patient has a rapidly growing, purplish lesion on his back that is fungating and friable. These findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D. Nodular melanoma.

The patient has a diffuse 90% to 95% narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the most appropriate treatment for this condition.

Emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery is not the best option because it is a more invasive procedure that carries a higher risk of complications. Emergent closure of the atrial septal defect is not the best option because it will not address the underlying problem, which is the narrowing of the left main coronary artery. Emergent pulmonic valve balloon valvotomy is not the best option because it is a procedure that is used to treat narrowing of the pulmonic valve, which is not the patient's problem.

The patient's condition is urgent and requires immediate intervention. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the most appropriate treatment for this condition.

* The patient's history of a sudden voice change, odynophagia, and left-sided neck pain following a single sneeze is consistent with a thyroid cartilage fracture. These symptoms can occur when the thyroid cartilage is fractured, as this can cause bleeding and swelling in the larynx.
* The patient's physical examination findings are also consistent with a thyroid cartilage fracture. The patient had tenderness over the thyroid notch and left side of the laryngotracheal complex, which is a common finding in patients with this condition. Additionally, there was no palpable crepitus, which would be expected if the patient had a ruptured vocal fold hemangioma or laryngocele.
* The patient's flexible laryngoscopy findings are also consistent with a thyroid cartilage fracture. The patient had hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, which is a common finding in patients with this condition. Additionally, the patient had normal vocal fold movement and complete glottic closure, which would not be expected if the patient had a ruptured vocal fold hemangioma or laryngocele.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A ruptured vocal fold hemangioma is unlikely in this case because the patient did not have a history of trauma or surgery to the neck. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings were not consistent with a ruptured vocal fold hemangioma.
* A rupture of laryngocele is unlikely in this case because the patient did not have a history of trauma or surgery to the neck. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings were not consistent with a rupture of laryngocele.
* Traumatic intubation is unlikely in this case because the patient did not have a history of recent intubation. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings were not consistent with traumatic intubation.

A paraganglioma is a tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are located throughout the body, including the head and neck. Paragangliomas can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Symptoms of paraganglioma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor, but they can include headaches, hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial pain. Treatment for paraganglioma typically involves surgery to remove the tumor.

A cholesteatoma is a growth of abnormal skin cells that can develop in the middle ear. Cholesteatomas can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Treatment for cholesteatoma typically involves surgery to remove the growth.

A dehiscent carotid canal is a condition in which the wall of the carotid canal, which is the channel that carries the carotid artery through the skull, is thin or missing. Dehiscent carotid canals can cause symptoms such as tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. Treatment for dehiscent carotid canals typically involves surgery to repair the wall of the carotid canal.

In the case of the man in the question, the most likely diagnosis is a persistent stapedial artery. A persistent stapedial artery is a rare condition in which a small artery that normally disappears during fetal development remains in the adult. This artery can cause tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. Treatment for a persistent stapedial artery typically involves surgery to remove the artery.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Paragangliomas, cholesteatoma, and dehiscent carotid canals can all cause tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo, but they are not associated with the specific symptoms that the patient in the question experienced.

A glomus tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the glomus body, a small structure that regulates blood flow in the skin. Glomus tumors are most commonly found in the hands and feet, but they can also occur in the head and neck, including the trachea.

Glomus tumors are typically small, round, and well-circumscribed. They are often red or purple in color and may be tender to the touch. Glomus tumors can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the affected area.

The diagnosis of a glomus tumor is made based on a physical examination and imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. A biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Glomus tumors are typically treated with surgery. The tumor can be removed completely in most cases. Radiation therapy may be used to treat tumors that cannot be removed completely or that recur after surgery.

The prognosis for patients with glomus tumors is excellent. Most patients have a good long-term outcome after treatment.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most likely diagnosis for a cervical tracheal mass in a woman in her 70s.

A superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the superior laryngeal nerve. Superior laryngeal nerve schwannomas are most commonly found in the neck, but they can also occur in the head and neck, including the trachea.

A carcinoid tumor is a rare, slow-growing type of cancer that arises from neuroendocrine cells. Carcinoid tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract.

A squamous papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. It is typically a small, pedunculated lesion that is found in the upper esophagus. Squamous papillomas are usually asymptomatic, but they can occasionally cause bleeding or dysphagia.

A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract that control motility. GISTs are typically found in the stomach or small intestine, but they can also occur in the esophagus. GISTs are usually diagnosed in adults, and they are more common in men than women.

A lipoma is a benign tumor that arises from fat cells. It is typically a soft, movable mass that is found under the skin. Lipomas are usually asymptomatic, but they can occasionally cause pain or discomfort.

The patient in the case presented with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. He also had anemia and a positive fecal occult blood test. An upper endoscopy revealed a necrotic polypoid lesion protruding from the esophagogastric junction. A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed an esophageal intraluminal tubular mass of soft-tissue density.

The patient's history and physical findings are consistent with a diagnosis of fibrovascular polyp. Fibrovascular polyps are benign tumors that arise from the submucosa of the esophagus. They are typically small, pedunculated lesions that are found in the middle or lower esophagus. Fibrovascular polyps are usually asymptomatic, but they can occasionally cause bleeding or dysphagia.

The patient's upper endoscopy revealed a necrotic polypoid lesion protruding from the esophagogastric junction. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of fibrovascular polyp. Fibrovascular polyps are often necrotic, and they can occasionally ulcerate.

The patient's computed tomographic scan revealed an esophageal intraluminal tubular mass of soft-tissue density. This finding is also consistent with a diagnosis of fibrovascular polyp. Fibrovascular polyps are typically soft, and they can occasionally calcify.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A squamous papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. It is typically a small, pedunculated lesion that is found in the upper esophagus. Squamous papillomas are usually asymptomatic, but they can occasionally cause bleeding or dysphagia.

 66%|██████▋   | 1014/1525 [4:08:47<2:12:29, 15.56s/it]The correct answer is C: Obtain carotid Doppler.

The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and presents with blurred vision in the right eye for 2 months. The examination findings are consistent with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), which is a blockage of the central retinal vein. CRVO is a leading cause of blindness in the United States.

The most common cause of CRVO is arteriosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. When the carotid arteries are narrowed or blocked, blood flow to the brain is reduced. This can lead to a stroke.

A carotid Doppler is a test that uses sound waves to measure the blood flow in the carotid arteries. A carotid Doppler can help to identify patients who are at risk for a stroke.

In this case, the patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia, which is a risk factor for arteriosclerotic disease. The patient also presents with blurred vision in the right eye, which is a symptom of CRVO. The examination findings are consistent with CRVO.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a carotid Doppler. The carotid Doppler will help to identify the cause of the CRVO and determine the risk of a stroke.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Observe. This is not the correct answer because the patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and presents with blurred vision in the right eye. The examination findings are consistent with CRVO, which is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Therefore, the patient needs to be evaluated further to determine the cause of the CRVO and to prevent a stroke.
* Option B: Perform panretinal photocoagulation. This is not the correct answer because panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, not CRVO.
* Option D: Refer to cardiology. This is not the correct answer because the patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia, not heart disease. The patient needs to be evaluated for the cause of the CRVO, not for heart disease.

 67%|██████▋   | 1015/1525 [4:08:58<2:00:13, 14.14s/it]The correct answer is D. Discontinue treatment with amantadine.

Amantadine is a medication used to treat influenza A and Parkinson's disease. It is also used to prevent and treat shingles. Amantadine is a member of the antiviral drug class. It works by preventing the virus from replicating.

Amantadine can cause side effects, including:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Blurred vision
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Changes in taste
* Skin rash
* Trouble sleeping
* Weight gain
* Increased sweating
* Changes in urination
* Sexual problems
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Hallucinations
* Psychosis

If you experience any of these side effects, it is important to talk to your doctor.

In the case of the patient in the question, she is experiencing bilateral corneal edema, Descemet folds, microcystic edema, and endothelial guttae. These are all signs of amantadine-induced corneal toxicity. Amantadine can cause corneal toxicity by interfering with the function of the corneal endothelial cells. The corneal endothelial cells are responsible for pumping fluid out of the cornea. When these cells are damaged, fluid builds up in the cornea, causing it to become swollen and opaque.

The best way to treat amantadine-induced corneal toxicity is to discontinue treatment with amantadine. In some cases, topical steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. Corneal edema may resolve on its own, but it may take several weeks or months. In severe cases, a corneal transplant may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Bilateral Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that is used to treat advanced corneal edema. Corneal topography is a diagnostic procedure that is used to map the surface of the cornea. Observe is not an appropriate treatment for amantadine-induced corneal toxicity.

 67%|██████▋   | 1016/1525 [4:09:09<1:50:53, 13.07s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and prescribe antibiotics.

The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, including the eyes. Sarcoidosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including periorbital masses. In this case, the patient's periorbital mass is painful and erythematous, suggesting that it is infected. The patient has also been treated with oral and topical antibiotics without improvement. This suggests that the infection is resistant to oral antibiotics and may require surgical drainage.

Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that can be used to drain an infected lacrimal sac. The procedure involves making a small incision in the inner canthus of the eye and then creating a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. This allows the infected fluid to drain out of the eye and into the nose.

Prescribing antibiotics is also important in the treatment of this patient's periorbital mass. The antibiotics will help to kill the bacteria that are causing the infection. The patient should continue to take the antibiotics as prescribed, even after the surgery.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. A biopsy of the mass is not necessary, as the patient's history and physical examination suggest that the mass is infected. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is not necessary, as the CT scan has already shown that the mass is peripherally enhancing. This finding is consistent with an infection. Prescribing topical and systemic antibiotics and recommending use of warm compresses without planned surgical or procedural intervention is not appropriate, as the patient has already been treated with oral and topical antibiotics without improvement.

 67%|██████▋   | 1017/1525 [4:09:25<1:59:10, 14.08s/it]The correct answer is B. Genetic testing.

The patient has a history of postconcussion syndrome and progressive vision loss for 2 years. She also has red-green color deficiency, mild mottled retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities bilaterally, and disruption and loss of the interdigitation and ellipsoid zones subfoveally. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Stargardt disease, an inherited retinal degeneration. Genetic testing is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the patient's risk of passing the disease on to her children.

MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast is not necessary in this case, as the patient's brain MRI within the last year was normal. Lumbar puncture is not indicated, as there is no evidence of infection or inflammation. Audiogram is not indicated, as the patient does not have any hearing complaints.

In addition to genetic testing, the patient should be referred to a retinal specialist for further evaluation and management. She should also be counseled about the risks and benefits of genetic testing, as well as the implications of a positive diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can appear as a red, scaly patch or a raised bump. It is most common in people over the age of 50. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. This results in thick, red, scaly patches on the skin. Keratoacanthoma is a type of skin cancer that is often mistaken for a wart. It is usually a single, dome-shaped bump on the skin that can grow quickly.

The patient in the case presented with multiple thick, mildly pruritic, yellow hyperkeratotic plaques on her lower extremities. This is consistent with the presentation of hypertrophic lichen planus. Hypertrophic lichen planus is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by thick, scaly patches on the skin. It is most common in adults, but it can also occur in children. The cause of hypertrophic lichen planus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. The condition is usually treated with topical corticosteroids, but in some cases, oral corticosteroids or other medications may be necessary.

Recurrent CDI is defined as a second episode of CDI occurring within 8 weeks of the initial episode. In this case, the patient has had no symptoms for 6 weeks, so it is unlikely that he has recurrent CDI.

Severe CDI is defined as CDI with at least three of the following criteria: fever, leukocytosis, abdominal distention, ileus, or toxic megacolon. In this case, the patient does not have any of these symptoms, so it is unlikely that he has severe CDI.

Refractory CDI is defined as CDI that is not resolved after two or more courses of standard therapy. In this case, the patient has only had one course of therapy, so it is too early to say whether he has refractory CDI.

Postinfectious altered bowel habits are a common sequela of CDI. They are characterized by increased stool frequency, loose stools, and abdominal discomfort. These symptoms can persist for weeks or months after the initial infection has been resolved. There is no specific treatment for postinfectious altered bowel habits, but a high-fiber diet can help to improve symptoms.

In this case, the patient has a history of CDI and is now experiencing abdominal discomfort, loose stools, and increased stool frequency. A repeat stool test for C difficile toxin PCR is positive. These findings are consistent with postinfectious altered bowel habits with C difficile colonization.

BRBNS is caused by a defect in the gene encoding the protein ephrin-B3, and is associated with other health problems, such as seizures, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities.
* Venous malformation (VM) is a type of vascular anomaly characterized by abnormal collections of veins. VMs can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Congenital VMs are often associated with other genetic syndromes, such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Acquired VMs can be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation. VMs can be painful, and can also cause cosmetic problems. Treatment for VMs is aimed at relieving pain and improving appearance. Options include sclerotherapy, laser therapy, and surgery.
* Hemangioma is a type of vascular anomaly characterized by abnormal collections of blood vessels. Hemangiomas are most common in infants and children, and typically resolve on their own within a few years.

HPMH is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the skin and other organs. It is caused by mutations in the MUC1 gene, which codes for a mucin glycoprotein. The most common presentation of HPMH is the development of multiple, small, skin-colored or erythematous papules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The papules are usually asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic or tender. In some cases, the papules may coalesce to form plaques or nodules. HPMH can also affect the eyes, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system.

The diagnosis of HPMH is based on a clinical history and physical examination, as well as laboratory testing and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is a skin biopsy, which shows the characteristic accumulation of mucin in the dermis. Other laboratory tests that may be helpful include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan, may be used to look for evidence of involvement of other organs.

There is no cure for HPMH, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. The most common treatment is a topical corticosteroid cream, which can be used to reduce inflammation and itching. In some cases, oral corticosteroids or other medications may be necessary. Treatment of the underlying cause of HPMH, such as a mutation in the MUC1 gene, is not currently possible.

The prognosis for HPMH varies depending on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, the disease may be relatively benign and self-limited. However, in more severe cases, the disease can be progressive and life-threatening.

Amyloid angiopathy is a condition in which amyloid plaques build up in the walls of small blood vessels in the brain. This can lead to bleeding, stroke, and dementia. However, amyloid angiopathy typically does not cause multiple lesions, and the patient in the case does not have any of the other symptoms associated with amyloid angiopathy, such as dementia.

Metastatic melanoma is a type of cancer that starts in the skin and spreads to other parts of the body, including the brain. However, metastatic melanoma typically does not cause multiple lesions in the brain, and the patient in the case does not have any of the other symptoms associated with metastatic melanoma, such as a history of skin cancer.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the small blood vessels in the brain. This can lead to multiple small strokes, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and difficulty with thinking and memory. However, CADASIL typically does not cause lesions in the spinal cord, and the patient in the case does not have any of the other symptoms associated with CADASIL, such as a family history of the disease.

Multiple cavernous malformations are a group of small, abnormal blood vessels that can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the brain and spinal cord. They are usually harmless, but can sometimes bleed, causing seizures, headaches, or other neurological problems.

Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a limited area on one side of the body, often in a stripe. The initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes the acute (short-lived) illness chickenpox, which generally occurs in children and young adults. Once an episode of chickenpox has resolved, the virus is not eliminated from the body but can go on to cause shingles—an illness with very different symptoms—often many years after the initial infection.

Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in the nerves near the spine and brain. Years later, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles.

The most common symptom of shingles is a painful, blistering rash that appears in a stripe on one side of the body. The rash usually lasts for two to four weeks. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, and muscle aches.

Shingles is most common in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. It is not contagious, but the varicella zoster virus can be spread to people who have never had chickenpox.

There is no cure for shingles, but there are treatments that can help relieve the symptoms. Treatment usually includes antiviral medications and pain relievers.

A microcystic lymphatic malformation is a rare type of birthmark that is caused by a defect in the lymphatic system. It is characterized by clusters of small, fluid-filled cysts that can appear anywhere on the body. Microcystic lymphatic malformations are usually harmless, but they can sometimes cause problems such as pain, infection, and disfigurement.

Eczema herpeticum is a skin infection that occurs when the herpes simplex virus (HSV) infects the skin of someone who has eczema. It is characterized by a rash of small blisters that are often filled with fluid. The rash can be painful and itchy, and it can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

A hypersensitivity reaction is an allergic reaction that occurs when the body's immune system reacts to a foreign substance. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.

In the case of the 18-month-old boy, the most likely diagnosis is herpes zoster. This is because he has a painful, blistering rash in a stripe on one side of his body, which is a classic symptom of shingles. He also has no known sick contacts at day care, exposure to herpes simplex virus, or exposure to new topical products or clothing. These factors make it less likely that he has eczema herpeticum, a hypersensitivity reaction, or microcystic lymphatic malformation.

 67%|██████▋   | 1025/1525 [4:11:19<2:04:50, 14.98s/it]The correct answer is B. Liposarcoma.

Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer that starts in the adrenal glands, which are small, hormone-producing glands that sit on top of each kidney. Adrenocortical carcinomas are usually very aggressive and can spread quickly to other parts of the body. The most common symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma are abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include high blood pressure, headache, and nausea.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. Lymphomas can be divided into two main types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively rare cancer that usually affects people between the ages of 15 and 35. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a more common cancer that can affect people of any age.

Leiomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the blood vessels, intestines, and other organs. Leiomyosarcomas are usually slow-growing tumors, but they can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

The patient in the case presented with a large retroperitoneal mass, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma, and they are typically found in the abdomen or retroperitoneum. Liposarcomas are often slow-growing tumors, but they can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation as well as liposarcoma does. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer that is not typically associated with leukocytosis or hyponatremia. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes, but it is not typically associated with a retroperitoneal mass. Leiomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that can affect the smooth muscle cells, but it is not typically associated with leukocytosis or hyponatremia.

 67%|██████▋   | 1026/1525 [4:11:35<2:08:11, 15.41s/it]The correct answer is B. Internal hernia of the cecum.

The patient is a woman in her 60s who presented with acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain for 24 hours accompanied by nausea and retching. She had no significant medical history and no prior abdominal surgery. In the emergency department, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Results of her abdominal examination revealed a slight distension and diffuse tenderness to palpation, particularly in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant, but no peritoneal signs. Results of laboratory tests were unremarkable except for mild leukocytosis. Abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant.

The most likely diagnosis is internal hernia of the cecum. Internal hernias are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all hernias. They occur when a portion of the bowel herniates through a defect in the mesentery, which is the membrane that attaches the bowel to the abdominal wall. The most common site for internal hernias is the foramen of Winslow, which is an opening in the mesentery that allows the superior mesenteric artery and vein to pass from the abdomen to the retroperitoneum.

The symptoms of internal hernias vary depending on the size of the hernia and the portion of the bowel that is herniated. Small hernias may be asymptomatic, while larger hernias can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. In some cases, internal hernias can lead to strangulation of the bowel, which is a medical emergency.

The diagnosis of internal hernias is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment of internal hernias depends on the size of the hernia, the portion of the bowel that is herniated, and the symptoms. Small hernias that are asymptomatic may be managed conservatively with observation. Larger hernias or hernias that are causing symptoms may require surgery to repair the hernia.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cecal volvulus is a condition in which the cecum, the lower right portion of the large intestine, twists on its axis. This can cause obstruction of the bowel and lead to ischemia and necrosis of the cecum. The patient in this case does not have the typical symptoms of cecal volvulus, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever.
* Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly in which the intestines are not properly positioned in the abdomen. This can lead to obstruction of the bowel and other complications. The patient in this case does not have a history of intestinal malrotation.
* Midgut volvulus is a life-threatening condition in which the midgut, the portion of the small intestine that contains the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, twists on its axis. This can cause obstruction of the bowel and lead to ischemia and necrosis of the midgut. The patient in this case does not have the typical symptoms of midgut volvulus, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever.

 67%|██████▋   | 1027/1525 [4:11:49<2:04:55, 15.05s/it]The correct answer is C. Order B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves.

The patient is a woman in her 30s who presents with bilateral papilledema. Papilledema is a swelling of the optic disc, which is the area at the back of the eye where the optic nerve enters. It is a sign of increased pressure in the brain, and can be caused by a number of conditions, including tumors, blood clots, and infections.

The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for any one condition. She does not have any specific symptoms, and her medical, family, and social history are unremarkable. Her best-corrected visual acuity is normal, and her extraocular movements are intact. Her pupils are round and reactive, and she does not have an afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure is normal. Her anterior segment examination is within normal limits. Examination of her fundus reveals bilateral papilledema. The remainder of her posterior segment is unremarkable.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order imaging studies to assess the cause of the papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the most sensitive test for identifying intracranial lesions. However, in this patient, the history and physical examination are not concerning for a mass lesion, and MRI is not necessary. Lumbar puncture with opening pressure is another test that can be used to assess intracranial pressure. However, in this patient, the opening pressure is likely to be normal, as she does not have any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves are two non-invasive tests that can be used to evaluate the optic nerves. B-scan ultrasonography can be used to measure the thickness of the optic nerve, and to assess for any abnormalities in the structure of the nerve. Fundus autofluorescence imaging can be used to identify areas of abnormal blood vessel function in the optic nerve.

In this patient, B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation. These tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis of papilledema, and to assess the severity of the condition. The results of these tests can also be used to guide further management, such as the need for optic nerve sheath fenestration or corticosteroid therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This is not necessary in this patient, as the history and physical examination are not concerning for a mass lesion.
* Option B: Order a lumbar puncture with opening pressure. This is not necessary in this patient, as she does not have any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.
* Option D: Admit the patient and consult neuro-ophthalmology. This is not necessary in this patient, as she does not have any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.

 67%|██████▋   | 1028/1525 [4:12:06<2:07:50, 15.43s/it]The correct answer is B. Lymph node biopsy.

The patient has bilateral anterior uveitis unresponsive to treatment with topical steroids. He also has a history of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck unresponsive to treatment with systemic antibiotics. These findings are concerning for a systemic inflammatory condition, such as sarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect any organ system. The most common ocular manifestation of sarcoidosis is anterior uveitis, which is seen in up to 50% of patients. Other ocular manifestations include retinal vasculitis, choroiditis, and optic neuritis.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is a tissue biopsy showing noncaseating granulomas. However, lymph node biopsy is often the first step in the diagnostic workup, as it is relatively easy to perform and can provide valuable information about the extent of disease.

In this case, the patient's bilateral anterior uveitis unresponsive to treatment with topical steroids, his history of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck unresponsive to treatment with systemic antibiotics, and his negative results on Gram stain and culture of aqueous and vitreous biopsy sample results, serum human leukocyte antigen B27, tuberculosis, syphilis, and sarcoidosis test results are all concerning for sarcoidosis. Therefore, the next best step in management is to perform a lymph node biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of disease.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in management for a patient with suspected sarcoidosis.

A. Biopsy of iris nodule is not the most appropriate next step in management because it is unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Iris nodules are a common finding in patients with sarcoidosis, but they can also be seen in other conditions, such as uveitis and tuberculosis.

C. Prescribing intravitreal vancomycin and ceftrazidime is not the most appropriate next step in management because these antibiotics are not effective against sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a noninfectious inflammatory condition, so antibiotics are not necessary.

D. Obtaining bacterial and fungal blood cultures is not the most appropriate next step in management because the patient's negative results on Gram stain and culture of aqueous and vitreous biopsy sample results suggest that he does not have an infectious uveitis.

 67%|██████▋   | 1029/1525 [4:12:18<1:59:05, 14.41s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement.

The patient in the case has a history of mitral valve replacement, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. He presented to the clinic with worsening exertional dyspnea. A transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated complete immobilization of 1 mechanical leaflet and impaired excursion of the other leaflet, with subsequent severe mitral stenosis.

Prosthetic valve thrombosis is a serious complication of mitral valve replacement that can lead to hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and death. The treatment of prosthetic valve thrombosis is urgent surgical valve replacement.

Intravenous unfractionated heparin and intravenous thrombolysis are not indicated for the treatment of prosthetic valve thrombosis. Intravenous unfractionated heparin can be used as a bridge to surgery, but it is not a definitive treatment. Intravenous thrombolysis is contraindicated in patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis because it can increase the risk of bleeding.

Empirical antibiotics for prosthetic valve endocarditis are not indicated in this patient because he does not have any evidence of endocarditis. The diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is made by blood cultures and echocardiography. Treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis requires surgery and antibiotics.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement.

 68%|██████▊   | 1030/1525 [4:12:30<1:52:27, 13.63s/it]The correct answer is B. Tracheocele.

A tracheocele is an abnormal outpouching of the tracheal wall. It is usually caused by a weakness in the tracheal wall, which can be congenital or acquired. Congenital tracheoceles are rare and are usually diagnosed in infants. Acquired tracheoceles are more common and are often caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.

Tracheoceles can be classified as intraluminal or extraluminal. Intraluminal tracheoceles are located within the lumen of the trachea, while extraluminal tracheoceles are located outside the lumen of the trachea. Extraluminal tracheoceles are more common than intraluminal tracheoceles.

Tracheoceles can be asymptomatic or may cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and stridor. Symptoms are more common in larger tracheoceles.

Diagnosis of tracheocele is usually made with a chest X-ray or CT scan. A bronchoscopy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions.

Treatment of tracheocele depends on the size and symptoms of the tracheocele. Small, asymptomatic tracheoceles may not require treatment. Larger tracheoceles or tracheoceles that cause symptoms may be treated with surgery. Surgery involves excising the tracheocele.

The prognosis for tracheocele is good. Most patients with tracheocele have a successful outcome with treatment.

A. Apical lung bulla/bleb is a thin-walled, air-filled space that forms in the lung. It is usually caused by a weakening of the lung tissue. Apical lung bullae are most common in smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

B. Tracheocele is an abnormal outpouching of the tracheal wall. It is usually caused by a weakness in the tracheal wall, which can be congenital or acquired. Congenital tracheoceles are rare and are usually diagnosed in infants. Acquired tracheoceles are more common and are often caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.

C. Laryngocele is a small, balloon-like sac that forms on the side of the larynx. It is usually caused by a weakness in the laryngeal wall. Laryngoceles are most common in men and are often associated with vocal cord dysfunction.

D. Zenker diverticulum is a pouch that forms in the esophagus. It is usually caused by a weakness in the esophageal wall. Zenker diverticula are most common in older adults and are often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

In this case, the patient has a history of undifferentiated insular carcinoma of the thyroid, which was treated with substernal total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection. The patient developed an expansile mass in the right central compartment following the lymph node dissection. The mass was excised and histopathologic analysis revealed a cystic mass composed primarily of mucosal cells and sparse fibroconnective tissue. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tracheocele.

 68%|██████▊   | 1031/1525 [4:12:45<1:57:07, 14.23s/it]The correct answer is D. Laryngeal neurofibroma.

Laryngeal neurofibroma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the nerve sheath. It is most commonly seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors of the nervous system.

The most common symptom of laryngeal neurofibroma is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include stridor, dyspnea, and pain. The diagnosis is made with a biopsy of the tumor. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Laryngeal sarcoid is a granulomatous disease that can involve any part of the body, including the larynx. It is not associated with NF1.
* Granular cell tumor is a benign tumor that can occur anywhere in the body, including the larynx. It is not associated with NF1.
* Laryngeal rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from skeletal muscle. It is not associated with NF1.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Laryngeal neurofibroma. This is a rare benign tumor that arises from the nerve sheath. It is most commonly seen in patients with NF1. The most common symptom is hoarseness. The diagnosis is made with a biopsy of the tumor. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

A sialocele is a cystic swelling that occurs when saliva is blocked from flowing out of the submandibular gland. This can happen due to a stricture or blockage of the duct, as in this case. The symptoms of a sialocele include pain, swelling, and tenderness in the area of the gland. Treatment typically involves draining the cyst and removing the blockage.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphangioma is a rare type of tumor that can occur in the lymphatic system. It is not caused by a blockage of the submandibular duct.
* Mucus retention cyst is a small, fluid-filled sac that can form in the salivary glands. It is not caused by a blockage of the submandibular duct.
* Abscess is a localized collection of pus that can form in any part of the body. It is not caused by a blockage of the submandibular duct.

Candidiasis is a fungal infection that can cause white patches on the tongue, throat, and other parts of the body. It is not a common cause of epiglottitis.

Diphtheric laryngitis is a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the larynx. It is characterized by a thick, gray membrane that can block the airway.

Pseudomembranous epiglottitis is a condition that is similar to diphtheric laryngitis, but it is caused by a different type of bacteria. It is also characterized by a thick, gray membrane that can block the airway.

Necrotizing epiglottitis is a serious bacterial infection that can cause inflammation and necrosis of the epiglottis. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.

The patient in this case presented with a 2-week history of progressive sore throat, dysphagia, and fever. She also developed dyspnea, dysphonia, and neck pain on the day of presentation. Her initial clinical evaluation revealed respiratory distress with respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Her heart rate was 95 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 135/91 mm Hg, and she was pyretic. Further examination with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed considerable erythema and edema of the epiglottitis with patchy necrosis partially obstructing the glottis and saliva pooling in the supraglottis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of necrotic epiglottitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings. Candidiasis is a fungal infection that can cause white patches on the tongue, throat, and other parts of the body. It is not a common cause of epiglottitis. Diphtheric laryngitis is a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the larynx. It is characterized by a thick, gray membrane that can block the airway.

The patient is a man in his 40s with a history of renal cell carcinoma and a 1-year history of decreased vision and the sensation of tunnel vision. He also has a 2-year history of cognitive decline. His evaluation includes brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic evaluation with unremarkable results, and he is scheduled to undergo neuropsychological testing.

On examination, the patient has counting fingers vision in his right eye and 20/100 vision in his left eye. There is a right afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the right eye reveals rubeosis iridis, a clear lens, neovascularization of the optic disc, retinal vasculitis, venous sheathing, and a dusky-appearing peripheral retina. The left eye has a clear lens and a normal fundus on clinical examination. Fluorescein angiography demonstrates a mixed retinal arteritis and phlebitis with extensive retinal and choroidal nonperfusion of the right eye with both retinal and optic nerve neovascularization. The left eye demonstrates patches of active arteritis peripherally with a minimally affected posterior pole.

The patient's presentation is consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that typically affects medium- and large-sized arteries. GCA is a serious condition that can lead to blindness, stroke, and other serious complications. The diagnosis of GCA is based on clinical features, including the presence of headache, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms, as well as laboratory findings, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Treatment of GCA is with high-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone.

In this case, the patient's history, examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of GCA. The patient's visual symptoms are a serious complication of GCA, and they warrant immediate treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Administer methylprednisolone, 1 g intravenously daily.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, not GCA.
* Checking antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme can be helpful in the diagnosis of other autoimmune diseases, but they are not specific for GCA.
* Plasmapheresis is a treatment for some autoimmune diseases, but it is not recommended for GCA.

 68%|██████▊   | 1035/1525 [4:13:52<2:12:18, 16.20s/it]The correct answer is C. Refer for magnetic resonance imaging.

A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test that checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. It can be used to screen for anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. However, a CBC is not likely to be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with any of these conditions.

Genetic testing is a procedure that looks for changes in genes that may cause or increase the risk of developing a disease. Genetic testing can be used to screen for inherited conditions, such as retinoblastoma, which is a rare type of eye cancer that can occur in children. However, genetic testing is not likely to be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with retinoblastoma.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is a test that uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. MRI scans can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including brain tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. In this case, an MRI scan is likely to be helpful, as it can provide information about the mass in the patient's eye and whether it is cancerous.

A retinal biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the retina. Retinal biopsies are used to diagnose and treat a variety of retinal conditions, including retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. However, a retinal biopsy is not likely to be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with any of these conditions.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Refer for magnetic resonance imaging.

 68%|██████▊   | 1036/1525 [4:14:09<2:12:51, 16.30s/it]The correct answer is B. Add trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) and corticosteroids.

The patient in this case has a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant 8 months prior to admission. She developed graft-vs-host disease requiring high-dose prednisone, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. At the time of admission, she was receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone.

The patient's presentation is concerning for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with hematologic malignancies and who have undergone stem cell transplantation. The patient's risk factors for PCP include her underlying malignancy, her allogeneic stem cell transplant, and her use of immunosuppressive medications.

The chest radiograph in this case shows bilateral opacities without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. This is a non-specific finding that can be seen with a variety of pulmonary infections, including PCP. The CT scan of the chest shows diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening. This is a more specific finding for PCP.

The initial empirical treatment for this patient included vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. These medications are appropriate for the treatment of a variety of bacterial and viral infections, but they are not specific for PCP.

The patient's clinical condition worsened despite the initial empirical treatment. She was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. This suggests that she has a severe infection that is not responding to the initial treatment.

The next step in the management of this patient is to add trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) and corticosteroids. TMP/SMZ is the first-line treatment for PCP. Corticosteroids are also used in the treatment of PCP to reduce inflammation and improve oxygenation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Add amikacin to cover multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter. Acinetobacter is a rare cause of pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies and stem cell transplantation. It is not a likely cause of this patient's pneumonia.
* C. Switch vancomycin to linezolid for refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies and stem cell transplantation. However, this patient's chest radiograph and CT scan do not suggest that she has MRSA pneumonia.
* D. Add liposomal amphotericin B to cover mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a rare but life-threatening fungal infection that can occur in patients with hematologic malignancies and stem cell transplantation. However, this patient's chest radiograph and CT scan do not suggest that she has mucormycosis.

A. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infection is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions were not pruritic (itchy) and did not have any evidence of infection, such as redness, swelling, or discharge. In addition, the patient's laboratory work-up, including blood cultures and fungal cultures, was negative for MRSA.

B. Candida tropicalis is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions were not consistent with candidiasis, which is a fungal infection that typically causes white, cheesy lesions on the skin. In addition, the patient's laboratory work-up, including fungal cultures, was negative for Candida.

D. Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions were not consistent with coccidioidomycosis, which is a fungal infection that typically causes skin lesions that are red, raised, and crusty. In addition, the patient's laboratory work-up, including coccidioidomycosis serology, was negative for Coccidioides immitis.

LC is a rare skin manifestation of leukemia that occurs in up to 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The skin lesions of LC are typically nonpruritic, soft, and non-ulcerating, and they can be located anywhere on the body. The diagnosis of LC is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. The treatment of LC is aimed at the underlying leukemia, and the skin lesions typically resolve with treatment of the leukemia.

In this case, the patient's history of AML, the presence of non-pruritic skin lesions, and the positive histopathology and immunohistochemistry for leukemia cells are all consistent with a diagnosis of LC. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

The patient's history of spontaneous subcutaneous ecchymoses and hematomas, as well as her laboratory results showing isolated severe anemia and a large soft-tissue hematoma on the left chest wall, are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The patient's lack of a history of bleeding disorders, preceding trauma, or other precipitating factors such as recent heparin exposure, surgical procedures, underlying liver disease, or receipt of anticoagulation agents suggests that the bleeding disorder is not acquired. The patient's normal vital signs and physical examination findings suggest that the bleeding disorder is not due to a systemic illness.

The mixing study results show that the patient's plasma does not clot when mixed with normal plasma, but does clot when mixed with a high concentration of factor VIII. This suggests that the patient has an inhibitor to factor VIII, which is an intrinsic clotting factor.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings.

* A. The patient has a common clotting factor inhibitor. This is incorrect because the patient's mixing study results show that she has an inhibitor to factor VIII, which is an intrinsic clotting factor. Common clotting factor inhibitors are inhibitors to factors VII, IX, X, and XI, which are extrinsic clotting factors.
* B. The patient has an extrinsic clotting factor inhibitor. This is incorrect because the patient's mixing study results show that she has an inhibitor to factor VIII, which is an intrinsic clotting factor. Extrinsic clotting factor inhibitors are inhibitors to factors VII, IX, X, and XI, which are extrinsic clotting factors.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a number of different conditions, including onychomycosis (fungal infection of the nails), psoriasis, and lichen planus. A diagnostic test, such as a nail biopsy, can help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's toenail problems and guide treatment.

Oral antifungals are not always effective in treating onychomycosis, and they can cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Topical antifungals are less effective than oral antifungals, but they are less likely to cause side effects.

Reassuring the patient that no treatment is necessary is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are significant and may be caused by a serious condition.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Choice A: Treat with an oral antifungal. Oral antifungals are not always effective in treating onychomycosis, and they can cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* Choice B: Reassure the patient that no treatment is necessary. Reassuring the patient that no treatment is necessary is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are significant and may be caused by a serious condition.

The most common symptom of a glomus tumor is pain, which is often described as sharp and stabbing. The pain may be triggered by cold temperatures, pressure, or vibration. Other symptoms may include redness, swelling, and a bluish discoloration of the skin.

Glomus tumors are typically diagnosed with a biopsy, which is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the lesion and examined under a microscope. Treatment for a glomus tumor is usually surgical excision.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms or the findings of the physical examination and imaging studies.

* Amelanotic melanoma is a type of skin cancer that does not produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. It is the most aggressive type of melanoma and is often fatal. The patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest that he has a melanoma.
* Onychopapilloma is a benign tumor of the nail bed. It is a small, raised growth that is usually painless. The patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest that he has an onychopapilloma.
* Squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the flat cells that make up the outer layer of the skin. It is usually not life-threatening, but it can spread to other parts of the body if it is not treated. The patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest that he has squamous cell carcinoma in situ.

Superficial spreading melanoma is a type of melanoma that is characterized by a slow-growing, asymmetrical lesion with irregular borders and variable pigmentation. It is the most common type of melanoma, accounting for approximately 70% of cases.

Dermatosis papulosa nigra is a benign condition that is characterized by small, dark papules on the face, neck, and upper trunk. It is more common in African Americans.

Metastatic melanoma is a type of melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body from the original site of the tumor. It is the most serious type of melanoma, and is often fatal.

The patient in this case has a 4-year history of diffuse progressive proliferation of dark papules. The lesions are dark brown-black and monomorphic, and are located throughout the trunk, extremities, palms, face, tongue, and sclera. There is no lymphadenopathy. Findings from laboratory tests, including a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and computed tomography of the chest, are unremarkable. A punch biopsy shows a circumscribed proliferation of pigmented epithelioid melanocytic nests, located primarily at tips of rete ridges. Moderate cytologic atypia is present. Superficial papillary dermis shows prominent pigment incontinence. No mitotic figures are seen. Kamino bodies were not visualized. Melan-A immunostain shows low pagetoid migration of melanocytes with a lack of melanocytic confluence at the dermal-epidermal junction.

The clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and lack of lymphadenopathy are consistent with a diagnosis of eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi. Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi is a rare, benign condition that is characterized by a sudden eruption of multiple dark papules. It is more common in children and young adults. The lesions are usually self-limited and resolve within a few years.

A verrucous hemangioma is a rare benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a single, pedunculated, verrucous lesion on the skin of the lower extremities. It is composed of dilated capillaries and venules in the dermis, and histologically shows features of both hemangioma and verruca vulgaris.

Malignant melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can arise from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. It is the most serious type of skin cancer, and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. Malignant melanoma typically presents as a dark, irregularly shaped mole that changes in size, shape, or color.

Verruca vulgaris is a common viral infection of the skin that causes warts. Warts are typically small, raised, rough-surfaced lesions that can occur anywhere on the body. They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), and are spread through contact with contaminated surfaces or people.

Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare vascular malformation that typically presents as a single, small, red or purple lesion on the skin. It is caused by a defect in the development of blood vessels, and is usually not associated with any other health problems.

The patient in the case presented with a large, verrucous plaque on his right calf. The lesion initially appeared as a small, bluish plaque at a young age and had gradually increased in size with subsequent development of wartlike features. Aside from minor local pain and pruritus, the patient reported history of recurrent infections as well as oozing and bleeding after minimal trauma. Physical examination revealed soft, compressible nodules overlying a friable verrucous plaque in a linear distribution involving the length of the right calf with minimal tenderness on palpation. No other lesions were found on the body. A deep punch biopsy specimen was obtained and sent for histopathological examination.

The histopathological examination showed epidermal verrucous hyperplasia, acanthosis, papillomatosis, and hyperkeratosis overlying dilated vessels in the dermis. This is consistent with the diagnosis of verrucous hemangioma.

This is because the patient has a history of asthma and constipation, which are both risk factors for tuberculosis. He also has intermittent, worsening lower back pain that wakes him from sleep, which are classic symptoms of tuberculous spondylitis. The physical examination findings are consistent with tuberculous spondylitis, as there is mild tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spine and mild pain elicited with flexion and extension of his back. The laboratory findings are also consistent with tuberculous spondylitis, as he has an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. The imaging findings are also consistent with tuberculous spondylitis, as the radiograph of his chest revealed a right paravertebral mass, destruction of left seventh rib, a compression fracture of T8, and bony erosion of L1 vertebra. The CT scan revealed paravertebral abscesses with T8 compression and destruction.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually affects children and young adults. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and a mass in the bone. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.
* Discitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc. It is usually caused by bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for discitis, and the imaging findings are not consistent with discitis.
* Pyogenic osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. It is usually caused by bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for pyogenic osteomyelitis, and the imaging findings are not consistent with pyogenic osteomyelitis.

 68%|██████▊   | 1044/1525 [4:16:18<2:12:09, 16.49s/it]The correct answer is B. Thymolipoma.

Thymolipoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the thymus gland. It is composed of both fat and thymic tissue. Thymomas are more common than thymolipomas, and they are often malignant. Mediastinal lipomatosis is a rare condition that is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the mediastinum. Myelolipomas are rare benign tumors that arise from the bone marrow.

The patient in the case presented with new-onset progressive dizziness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are consistent with a mediastinal mass that is compressing the heart. The physical examination revealed a positive Kussmaul sign and pulsus paradoxus, which are also consistent with a mediastinal mass. The electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia, which is a non-specific finding. The complete blood cell count and biochemical panel were within reference ranges, which suggests that the patient does not have an infection or an inflammatory condition. The chest radiograph revealed convexity on the right heart border suggestive of cardiomegaly. Echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac chambers and valves, but an echogenicity was noted compressing the superior vena cava and right ventricle. This finding is consistent with a mediastinal mass. The computed tomographic imaging of the chest revealed a large, 16.2 × 6.8 × 5.6-cm anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right cardiac structures, particularly the superior vena cava. The mass consisted mostly of fat attenuation, but was interspersed with nodular densities. This finding is consistent with a thymolipoma. Tumor marker levels, including α-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin, were within reference ranges. This finding suggests that the tumor is not malignant.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a history and physical examination that are consistent with a mediastinal mass. The imaging studies revealed a large, anterior mediastinal mass that is composed of both fat and thymic tissue. These findings are consistent with a thymolipoma. The tumor marker levels are within reference ranges, which suggests that the tumor is not malignant. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Thymolipoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Thymoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the thymus gland. The patient in the case presented with a history and physical examination that are consistent with a benign tumor. The imaging studies also revealed a benign tumor.
* C. Mediastinal lipomatosis is a rare condition that is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the mediastinum. The patient in the case presented with a history and physical examination that are consistent with a tumor that is composed of both fat and thymic tissue. The imaging studies also revealed a tumor that is composed of both fat and thymic tissue.
* D. Myelolipoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the bone marrow. The patient in the case presented with a history and physical examination that are consistent with a tumor that is located in the anterior mediastinum.

 69%|██████▊   | 1045/1525 [4:16:36<2:13:56, 16.74s/it]The correct diagnosis is right colon ischemia. The patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, which was treated with endoscopic treatment of a right colon arteriovenous malformation. This was unsuccessful and bleeding persisted. The patient underwent urgent angiography and embolization of a right colic artery branch. At angiography, no blush or bleeding vessel was evident. The decision to embolize the right colic branch was based on the endoscopic findings and the presence of pooling contrast in the cecum noted on a computed tomographic angiogram performed at the referring institution.

After the procedure, the patient reported abdominal pain. Findings from computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained at this time were unremarkable. He was treated with antibiotics and observed. He progressed to develop abdominal distension, vomiting, and significant right lower quadrant tenderness during the next 2 days.

These findings are consistent with right colon ischemia. Ischemia is a condition in which the blood supply to a part of the body is reduced, which can lead to tissue death. In the case of the colon, ischemia can cause abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and tenderness.

Endoscopic perforation is a perforation of the colon that can occur during colonoscopy. This is a rare complication, but it can be serious. Symptoms of endoscopic perforation include abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.

Prolonged ileus secondary to retained intraluminal old blood is a condition in which the small intestine becomes blocked due to the presence of old blood. This can occur after a gastrointestinal bleed. Symptoms of prolonged ileus include abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation.

Diverticular perforation is a perforation of a diverticulum, which is a small pouch that can form in the lining of the colon. This is a common condition, but it is usually not serious. Symptoms of diverticular perforation include abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is right colon ischemia. This is based on the patient's history of lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, the findings on the computed tomographic angiogram, and the patient's clinical presentation. The other choices are less likely diagnoses.

 69%|██████▊   | 1046/1525 [4:16:48<2:03:35, 15.48s/it]The correct answer is C: Obtain urinalysis.

The patient's history of nephrolithiasis and ureteroscopy raises the possibility of a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are a common cause of posterior uveitis, which is the type of uveitis that the patient is presenting with. Posterior uveitis can cause a variety of symptoms, including decreased visual acuity, floaters, and eye pain.

A urinalysis is a simple test that can be used to detect the presence of bacteria in the urine. If the urinalysis is positive for bacteria, then the patient can be treated with antibiotics. Treatment with antibiotics can help to resolve the uveitis and improve the patient's vision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Intravitreal injection with vancomycin and ceftazidime is a treatment for endophthalmitis, which is a serious infection of the eye. Endophthalmitis is a rare complication of UTIs, and the patient does not have any symptoms of endophthalmitis.
* Initiate uveitis workup and begin topical glucocorticoid therapy are both appropriate treatments for uveitis. However, it is important to first rule out a UTI as the cause of the uveitis. If the urinalysis is negative for bacteria, then the patient can be treated with uveitis workup and topical glucocorticoid therapy.
* Perform diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat a variety of eye conditions, including uveitis. However, it is a relatively invasive procedure, and it is not the first-line treatment for uveitis. The patient should only be considered for a diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy if other treatments have failed to improve the uveitis.

 69%|██████▊   | 1047/1525 [4:17:04<2:04:27, 15.62s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain specular microscopy.

The patient has a slightly displaced pupil in his right eye, along with 4 clock hours of iridocorneal touch nasally and a “hammered silver” appearance to the involved cornea. This suggests that the patient may have iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE syndrome). ICE syndrome is a rare, bilateral, non-inflammatory, degenerative disorder of the corneal endothelium and anterior chamber angle. It is characterized by corectopia (eccentric pupil), iridocorneal touch, and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS).

Pilocarpine eyedrops are used to treat glaucoma, which is a condition that causes high pressure in the eye. However, the patient does not have glaucoma, so pilocarpine eyedrops would not be appropriate in this case.

Testing the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) would not be helpful in this case. HSV-1 is a virus that can cause eye infections, but it is not associated with ICE syndrome.

Recommending genetic testing is not necessary in this case. ICE syndrome is not a genetic disorder, so genetic testing would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating the condition.

Specular microscopy is a test that can be used to evaluate the health of the corneal endothelium. In specular microscopy, a light is shined onto the cornea and the reflected light is collected and analyzed. This information can be used to assess the number, size, and shape of the corneal endothelial cells.

In the patient's case, specular microscopy would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of ICE syndrome and in monitoring the progression of the condition. Specular microscopy can also be used to assess the response to treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain specular microscopy.

 69%|██████▊   | 1048/1525 [4:17:17<1:56:57, 14.71s/it]The correct answer is D. Order catheter cerebral angiography.

The patient in this case has a history of worsening proptosis, redness, diplopia, and numbness in her right eye. She also has elevated intraocular pressure in the affected eye. On examination, she has limitation of her extraocular muscles in nearly all fields of gaze, with the most obvious limitation occurring in abduction. She has decreased sensation to light touch in the right cheek. There are no orbital bruits. Ocular examination reveals diffuse conjunctival injection with tortuous, dilated, corkscrew-shaped blood vessels. Dilated fundus examination reveals mild optic nerve hyperemia and mild vascular tortuosity.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-neoplastic, non-inflammatory disorder of the orbit that is characterized by inflammation of the orbital tissues. The most common symptoms of orbital pseudotumor are proptosis, pain, and diplopia. Other symptoms may include redness, swelling, and numbness of the eye and surrounding tissues.

The diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor is made based on the patient's history and examination findings. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

There is no single, definitive treatment for orbital pseudotumor. Treatment options include corticosteroids, orbital radiation therapy, and surgical decompression. The choice of treatment is based on the patient's symptoms, the severity of the inflammation, and the response to previous treatment.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and she has not responded to previous treatment. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to order catheter cerebral angiography. Catheter cerebral angiography is a procedure that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the brain and orbits. This procedure can help to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms and to guide treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Orbital biopsy is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor is already established.
* Systemic corticosteroids are a common treatment for orbital pseudotumor, but they have not been effective in this patient.
* Systemic antibiotics are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of infection.
* Orbital decompression is a surgical procedure that is used to relieve pressure in the orbit. This procedure is only indicated in cases where the patient has severe symptoms that do not respond to other treatments.

The patient has a white cataract in his left eye, which is a clouding of the lens of the eye that can cause decreased vision. The patient also has a history of trauma to the left eye, which could have caused the cataract. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to assess the structures of the eye and orbit, including the lens, cornea, retina, and optic nerve. A CT scan can help to identify the cause of the patient's cataract, such as an injury to the lens or an infection. A CT scan can also help to determine the extent of the cataract and whether it is affecting the patient's vision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Observation is not the correct answer because the patient has a white cataract that is causing decreased vision. The patient needs to have further testing to determine the cause of the cataract and whether it can be treated.
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits is not the correct answer because MRI is not as sensitive as CT scan for detecting abnormalities in the eye. MRI is also more expensive than CT scan.
* Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement in the left eye is not the correct answer because the patient has not been diagnosed with a retinal detachment or other condition that requires surgery. The patient needs to have further testing to determine the cause of the cataract before surgery can be considered.

 69%|██████▉   | 1050/1525 [4:17:48<1:59:26, 15.09s/it]The correct diagnosis is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This is a type of heart failure that is caused by a sudden, intense emotional stress or physical stress. It is also known as stress cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome, or broken heart syndrome.

The patient in the case presented above developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after undergoing bilateral sequential lung transplantation. The stress of the surgery and the subsequent complications, such as the intracerebral hemorrhage, triggered the condition.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by a sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart failure. The symptoms can be similar to those of a heart attack, but the condition is not caused by a blockage in the arteries.

On an electrocardiogram, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can look like a heart attack. However, blood tests will show that the levels of troponin and creatine phosphokinase, which are released when heart muscle cells are damaged, are normal.

Echocardiography can show that the left ventricle of the heart is dilated and that the apex of the heart is ballooned out. This is the characteristic appearance of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Treatment for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is supportive. The patient may need to be hospitalized for a few days or weeks. They will be given oxygen and medications to help their heart function.

Most people with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy make a full recovery. However, the condition can be fatal in some cases.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are:

* Myocardial infarction: This is a heart attack, which is caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The symptoms of a heart attack are similar to those of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, but the electrocardiogram and blood tests will show that the patient has had a heart attack.
* Pulmonary embolism with cardiogenic shock: This is a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the lungs. It can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart failure. The electrocardiogram and blood tests will show that the patient has a pulmonary embolism.
* Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema: This is a type of pulmonary edema that is not caused by heart failure. It can be caused by a number of things, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or kidney failure. The electrocardiogram and blood tests will show that the patient does not have heart failure.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, low-grade, locally aggressive mesenchymal tumor of the skin. It is characterized by a storiform growth pattern of spindle cells and a characteristic translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) resulting in the fusion of the COL1A1 and PDGFB genes.

The patient in the case presented with a steady 5-year progression of facial asymmetry and new-onset left-sided facial weakness, pain, and otalgia. Physical examination revealed no palpable parotid mass and no overlying skin changes. Neurologic examination showed incomplete left eye closure with a grade 5 of 6 on the House-Brackmann scale. Treatment with steroids and antiviral agents marginally improved facial strength and allowed eye closure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed subcutaneous nodules focally infiltrating the superficial parotid gland with evidence of perineural spread along the labyrinthine segment of CN VII. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasonographic guidance was nondiagnostic. An open excisional biopsy demonstrated dense subcutaneous tissue overlying and invading the parotid gland. Intraoperative frozen section revealed a spindle cell tumor. A superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection and preservation was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a subcutaneous mass with stellate extension into and around the parotid gland. The tumor consisted of bland fusiform tumor cells in a storiform pattern near inconspicuous hyalinized vessels. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated diffuse positivity for CD34, positivity for bcl-2, and negativity for CD99 and S-100. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) further characterized the tumor with a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) and corresponding COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic features of the tumor in the case are consistent with a diagnosis of DFSP. The storiform growth pattern of spindle cells and the characteristic translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) are diagnostic of DFSP. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not account for the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic features of the tumor in the case.

A. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign mesenchymal tumor of the skin. It is characterized by a storiform growth pattern of spindle cells and a characteristic translocation t(12;15)(q13;q24). The tumor in the case does not have the characteristic translocation of solitary fibrous tumor.

Bilateral malleus fixation is a rare condition in which the malleus, one of the three small bones in the middle ear, becomes fixed in place. This can cause conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss that occurs when sound waves are not able to travel properly through the middle ear.

The most common cause of bilateral malleus fixation is otosclerosis, a condition in which abnormal bone growth occurs in the middle ear. Otosclerosis is more common in women than men, and it usually occurs in people between the ages of 20 and 60.

Other possible causes of bilateral malleus fixation include:

* Trauma to the middle ear
* Infections of the middle ear
* Birth defects

The symptoms of bilateral malleus fixation can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some people with bilateral malleus fixation may not have any symptoms, while others may experience hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and fullness in the ear.

The diagnosis of bilateral malleus fixation is usually made based on a physical examination, an audiogram, and a CT scan of the temporal bones.

There is no cure for bilateral malleus fixation, but there are treatments that can help to improve hearing. The most common treatment is surgery to remove the fixed malleus and replace it with a prosthesis. Other treatments that may be used include hearing aids and cochlear implants.

The prognosis for people with bilateral malleus fixation is generally good. With treatment, most people are able to achieve good hearing.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most likely causes of bilateral conductive hearing loss in a young boy.

A. Bilateral otosclerosis is a common cause of conductive hearing loss in adults, but it is rare in children.

C. Bilateral tympanosclerosis is a condition in which scar tissue forms in the middle ear. This can cause conductive hearing loss, but it is usually not the only cause of hearing loss.

D. Bilateral malleoincudal subluxation is a condition in which the malleus and incus, two of the three small bones in the middle ear, become dislocated. This can cause conductive hearing loss, but it is usually not the only cause of hearing loss.

A parathyroid lipoadenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland that contains a mixture of parathyroid tissue and fat. It is the most common type of parathyroid tumor, accounting for up to 80% of cases. Parathyroid lipoadenomas are typically small, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter. They are usually found incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons.

Parathyroid lipoadenomas are usually asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms of hyperparathyroidism, such as high blood calcium levels, fatigue, weakness, and bone pain. Parathyroid lipoadenomas are treated by surgical removal.

This is a rare, chronic, self-healing disorder of the skin that is characterized by the appearance of recurrent, pruritic papules. The lesions are usually small, red, or violaceous, and they often ulcerate. They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk and extremities.

The cause of lymphomatoid papulosis is unknown. It is thought to be a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, but it is not clear whether it is a true lymphoma. The disease is usually seen in young adults, and it is more common in men than women.

The diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows a dense infiltrate of large, atypical lymphocytes in the dermis. The lymphocytes are positive for CD30, a marker of T-cell activation.

There is no specific treatment for lymphomatoid papulosis. The lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks or months. However, they can recur, and some patients may experience a chronic course of the disease. In rare cases, lymphomatoid papulosis can progress to a more aggressive lymphoma.

It is most common in people from Japan and the Caribbean. The symptoms of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma include fever, weight loss, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. The disease is usually fatal within a few years.
* Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive form of lymphoma that is confined to the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of large, atypical lymphocytes in the dermis. The symptoms of primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma include skin lesions that are often painful and ulcerated. The disease can spread to other parts of the body, and it is usually fatal within a few years.
* Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are two types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Mycosis fungoides is a chronic, slowly progressive form of lymphoma that usually begins as a patchy skin rash. Sézary syndrome is a more aggressive form of lymphoma that is characterized by a generalized erythroderma (red skin) and lymphadenopathy. Both diseases can spread to other parts of the body, and they are usually fatal within a few years.

The patient's TSH level of 4.5 mU/L is elevated, which is consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. The patient does not have any symptoms of overt hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, cold intolerance, or weight gain. However, subclinical hypothyroidism can progress to overt hypothyroidism, so it is important to monitor the patient's TSH level. The patient should have the TSH level repeated in 1 to 3 months to see if it has changed. If the TSH level remains elevated, the patient may need to start treatment with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: The patient does not have overt hypothyroidism. Her TSH level is elevated, but she does not have any symptoms of overt hypothyroidism.
* Choice B: The patient should have the TSH level repeated in 1 to 3 months to see if it has changed.
* Choice C: The patient does not have subclinical hyperthyroidism. Her TSH level is elevated, which is consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, a thiamine deficiency that can occur in patients with severe malnutrition, such as those with Crohn disease. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by nystagmus, ataxia, and confusion. It can progress to Korsakoff's psychosis, which is characterized by amnesia and confabulation.

Intravenous acyclovir is the treatment for herpes simplex encephalitis, which is a viral infection of the brain. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with herpes simplex encephalitis.

Intravenous thrombolysis is the treatment for acute ischemic stroke, which is a blockage of an artery in the brain. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with acute ischemic stroke.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, but they are not the first-line treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy. Parenteral thiamine is the first-line treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy.

The patient should be started on parenteral thiamine immediately. If the patient does not receive treatment, Wernicke's encephalopathy can progress to Korsakoff's psychosis, which is a permanent condition.

A. Guttata hypomelanosis is a common skin condition that causes small, white spots on the skin. It is usually caused by a fungal infection, and it is often treated with antifungal medication.

B. Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin to lose its pigment. It is characterized by white patches on the skin, and it is often treated with topical creams or light therapy.

C. Tumors of the follicular infundibulum are rare, benign tumors that grow in the hair follicles. They are usually small, and they often do not cause any symptoms. However, they can sometimes become infected or cause bleeding.

D. Tuberculoid leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness. It is treated with a combination of antibiotics.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 40s who presented with a 2-year history of multiple asymptomatic lesions on the face and neck. The lesions were round, hypopigmented macules and were symmetrically distributed in the affected area. The patient reported that the macules had appeared on his cheeks 2 years earlier and had gradually coalesced. The size of the lesions ranged from approximately 2 to 3 mm to 25 mm in diameter. There was no hair growth at the site of the lesions, and the patient reported no symptoms. He was treated for tinea versicolor, without success. A skin biopsy was performed to rule out some kind of morphea.

The clinical presentation and the histopathology findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tumors of the follicular infundibulum. These tumors are typically small, benign, and asymptomatic. They are often found in the hair follicles of the face and neck. The treatment for tumors of the follicular infundibulum is surgical excision.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the clinical presentation and the histopathology findings. Guttata hypomelanosis is a common skin condition that causes small, white spots on the skin. It is usually caused by a fungal infection, and it is often treated with antifungal medication.

This is a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the skin, muscles, and other organs. The most common symptoms are a rash on the face, hands, and feet, muscle weakness, and fatigue. Other possible symptoms include hair loss, joint pain, and difficulty swallowing.

The diagnosis of anti-MDA5-CAD is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The most specific test for anti-MDA5-CAD is a blood test for antibodies to anti-MDA5. Other tests that may be helpful include a muscle biopsy, chest X-ray, and CT scan of the chest.

There is no cure for anti-MDA5-CAD, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. The most common treatment is a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Other treatments that may be used include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.

The prognosis for patients with anti-MDA5-CAD is variable. Some patients have a mild course of disease that responds well to treatment. Others have a more severe course of disease that can lead to complications such as lung disease, heart disease, and kidney disease.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Sarcoidosis and/or lymphoma syndrome is a rare disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and skin lesions. It is not associated with the symptoms of anti-MDA5-CAD.
* Immunoglobulin G4-related disease is a group of autoimmune disorders that are caused by the production of antibodies against immunoglobulin G4. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including inflammation of the kidneys, skin, and other organs. It is not associated with the symptoms of anti-MDA5-CAD.

Wells syndrome is a rare, idiopathic, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by painful, erythematous, and edematous plaques or nodules on the extremities, trunk, and face. It is often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by biopsy, which shows a dense infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis and subcutis.

Cutaneous amyloidosis is a rare, chronic, progressive disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the skin. It can present with a variety of skin lesions, including papules, plaques, nodules, and tumors. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows amyloid deposits in the dermis and subcutis.

Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection caused by group A streptococcus. It is characterized by a well-demarcated, erythematous, and edematous plaque with a raised border. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by culture of the skin lesion.

In the case presented, the patient has a 2-month history of painful, occasionally pruritic, fixed erythema on the abdomen. He also has a splenic marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration, a history of splenectomy, and an IgM-κ paraproteinemia. His hematologic condition was considered stable by his physician, who had also been treating the patient for hepatitis C with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 3 months. On examination, there was a warm erythema on most of the abdomen, which appeared distended owing to hepatitis-induced ascites. Laboratory results showed an elevated but stable white blood cell count of 19.04 × 103µL, a recent rise of C-reactive protein levels to 179 mg/L, as well as a rise of IgM levels from 1060 mg/dL to 2220 mg/dL within the past year. A biopsy procedure was performed on the abdomen, which showed an interstitial infiltrate of deeply eosinophilic cells in the entire dermis and adjacent subcutis.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results are all consistent with crystal-storing histiocytosis. Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder characterized by the accumulation of non-birefringent crystals in histiocytes. It is most commonly seen in patients with hematologic disorders, such as lymphoma and leukemia. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows an interstitial infiltrate of histiocytes with numerous crystals.

 70%|██████▉   | 1061/1525 [4:20:36<1:57:57, 15.25s/it]The correct answer is B. Urea cycle disorder.

A urea cycle disorder is an inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to remove ammonia from the blood. Ammonia is a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down protein. In a healthy person, ammonia is converted into urea in the liver and excreted in the urine. However, in people with a urea cycle disorder, this process is not working properly and ammonia builds up in the blood.

The symptoms of a urea cycle disorder can vary depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, confusion, seizures, and coma. In severe cases, a urea cycle disorder can be life-threatening.

There is no cure for a urea cycle disorder, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment typically involves a low-protein diet, medications to reduce ammonia levels, and dialysis or kidney transplant.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Reye syndrome is a rare, life-threatening condition that can affect children and teenagers. It is caused by a combination of viral infection and aspirin use. The symptoms of Reye syndrome include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. There is no cure for Reye syndrome, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as fluid and electrolyte replacement, and medications to control seizures and brain swelling.
* Fatty acid oxidation disorder is a group of inherited disorders that affect the body's ability to break down fatty acids for energy. The symptoms of fatty acid oxidation disorders can vary depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. In severe cases, fatty acid oxidation disorders can be life-threatening. There is no cure for fatty acid oxidation disorders, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment typically involves a low-fat diet, medications to replace essential fatty acids, and supportive care, such as fluid and electrolyte replacement.
* Organic acidemia is a group of inherited disorders that affect the body's ability to break down certain organic acids. The symptoms of organic acidemias can vary depending on the specific disorder and the severity of the condition. Some common symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. In severe cases, organic acidemias can be life-threatening. There is no cure for organic acidemias, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and prevent complications.

The patient has a number of symptoms and signs that are consistent with Epstein-Barr virus infection, including:

* Fever
* Sore throat
* Bilateral conjunctival hemorrhage
* Periorbital edema
* Eyelid ecchymoses
* Tonsillar hypertrophy with erythema and exudates
* Mildly enlarged liver and spleen
* Leukocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes
* Mild thrombocytopenia
* Elevated aminotransferases
* Conjugated bilirubin
* Lactate dehydrogenase

A throat culture grew group A Streptococcus, but this is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Group A Streptococcus is a bacterium that can cause strep throat, which is characterized by fever, sore throat, and a white or yellow exudate on the tonsils. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical signs of strep throat, such as a white or yellow exudate on the tonsils. In addition, the patient's throat culture grew group A Streptococcus, but this does not mean that group A Streptococcus is the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is possible that the patient was colonized with group A Streptococcus, but that it is not the cause of the patient's illness.

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Epstein-Barr virus infection. Epstein-Barr virus is a virus that causes infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The patient in this case has many of the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, including fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. In addition, the patient's liver and spleen are mildly enlarged, which is a common finding in patients with infectious mononucleosis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely as Epstein-Barr virus infection. Streptococcal pharyngitis is a bacterial infection that causes strep throat. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical signs of strep throat, such as a white or yellow exudate on the tonsils. In addition, the patient's throat culture grew group A Streptococcus, but this does not mean that group A Streptococcus is the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is possible that the patient was colonized with group A Streptococcus, but that it is not the cause of the patient's illness.

Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that can occur in children. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical signs of neuroblastoma, such as a mass in the abdomen or bone pain. In addition, the patient's laboratory tests are not consistent with neuroblastoma.

Viral hepatitis is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the liver. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical signs of viral hepatitis, such as jaundice or dark urine. In addition, the patient's laboratory tests are not consistent with viral hepatitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Epstein-Barr virus infection.

A type IV hiatal hernia is a herniation of the stomach through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. It is the most common type of hiatal hernia, and it is usually caused by a weakening of the diaphragmatic muscle. Symptoms of a type IV hiatal hernia can include chest pain, heartburn, and difficulty swallowing.

A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm that is present at birth. It is caused by a failure of the diaphragm to develop properly during fetal development. Symptoms of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia can include respiratory distress, cyanosis, and abdominal distention.

A diaphragm eventration is a condition in which the diaphragm is weakened and fails to contract properly. This can cause the abdominal contents to herniate into the chest cavity. Symptoms of a diaphragm eventration can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing.

In this case, the patient has a history of a motorcycle crash many years ago. He also reports recent left-sided chest discomfort and longstanding dyspnea on exertion. A large air-fluid level was seen on a recent chest roentgenogram, and subsequent computed tomographic scans of his chest were obtained. The scans showed a herniation of the stomach into the chest cavity. This is consistent with a diagnosis of blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on the imaging studies. A type IV hiatal hernia is not typically associated with a history of trauma, and it would not cause the patient to have chest pain and shortness of breath. A congenital diaphragmatic hernia would also not be expected to cause these symptoms, and it would not be seen on imaging studies in an adult. A diaphragm eventration is a condition that is typically caused by a weakening of the diaphragm due to a medical condition, such as a tumor or a hernia. It is not typically caused by trauma, and it would not be expected to cause the patient to have chest pain and shortness of breath.

A pseudoaneurysm is a false aneurysm, which is a bulge in an artery wall that forms when the inner and middle layers of the artery wall tear. The outer layer of the artery wall remains intact, but blood leaks between the layers and forms a sac. Pseudoaneurysms can be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.

An apical aneurysm is a bulge in the apex of the left ventricle, which is the lower, pointed part of the heart. Apical aneurysms can be caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart muscle), or hypertension (high blood pressure).

Postinfarction hemorrhagic pericarditis is a condition that can occur after a myocardial infarction. In this condition, blood leaks from the damaged heart muscle into the pericardial sac, which is a sac that surrounds the heart. This can cause inflammation and pain in the chest.

Intramural hematoma is a collection of blood within the wall of the heart. It is most commonly caused by a myocardial infarction, but it can also be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.

In the case described above, the patient has a history of myocardial infarction and has developed progressive shortness of breath. He also has tachycardia (rapid heart rate), tachypnea (rapid breathing), and hypotension (low blood pressure). These findings are consistent with intramural hematoma.

The transthoracic echocardiography showed a hypoechoic mass around the apical region. This finding is also consistent with intramural hematoma.

The computed tomography of the chest revealed a large crescentic hypodense lesion surrounding the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle and apex. This finding is also consistent with intramural hematoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is intramural hematoma. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

The patient is a healthy teenaged boy who presented with multiple target lesions and erythema on his right eyelids. The lesions are consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, a viral infection of the facial nerve that causes a painful rash around the eye. The most common treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus is oral aciclovir, which is an antiviral medication that helps to reduce the severity of the rash and prevent complications such as postherpetic neuralgia.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Observe) is incorrect because the patient has a painful rash that is consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Oral aciclovir is the standard treatment for this condition, and it is important to start treatment as soon as possible to prevent complications.
* Option B (Prescribe oral flucloxacillin) is incorrect because the patient does not have a bacterial infection. Oral flucloxacillin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, but it is not effective against herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is a viral infection.
* Option C (Prescribe oral cimetidine) is incorrect because the patient does not have a peptic ulcer. Oral cimetidine is a medication that is used to treat peptic ulcers, but it is not effective against herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

The patient has a history of Klinefelter syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects males. One of the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome is photophobia, or sensitivity to light. The patient also has punctate keratitis, which is a condition that causes inflammation of the cornea. Topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops are both effective treatments for punctate keratitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* **A. Schedule an electroretinogram:** An electroretinogram is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is not necessary to order an electroretinogram in this case because the patient's symptoms are consistent with punctate keratitis.
* **B. Perform corneal cultures:** Corneal cultures are used to identify the bacteria or fungi that are causing an infection. The patient's symptoms do not suggest that he has an infection, so there is no need to perform corneal cultures.
* **D. Observe:** Observing the patient without treatment is not a good option because the patient is experiencing significant photophobia. Topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops are effective treatments for punctate keratitis and will help to relieve the patient's symptoms.

The patient has a history of transverse sinus thrombosis, which is a rare but serious condition that can lead to stroke, blindness, and death. The patient is now experiencing worsening headaches, nausea, blurred vision, weakness, and spasticity in her left upper and lower limbs, along with right ear pain and decreased hearing. These symptoms are consistent with progression of the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. A lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

In the setting of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a lumbar puncture can be used to assess the pressure of the CSF and to look for signs of infection. The CSF can also be tested for blood, which can be a sign of bleeding within the brain.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are concerning for progression of her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A lumbar puncture is the most important test that can be performed to diagnose and assess the severity of her condition. The results of the lumbar puncture will help the doctor determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

Options A and B are incorrect because they do not provide adequate treatment for the patient's condition. Option A would only continue the patient's anticoagulation therapy, which is not likely to be effective in treating the patient's worsening symptoms. Option B would add oral antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen, but this would not be sufficient to treat the patient's condition.

Option D is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition. A radical mastoidectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat mastoiditis, an infection of the mastoid air cells. However, the patient does not have mastoiditis, and a radical mastoidectomy would not be beneficial in treating her condition.

The patient in this case has a recent history of left-sided hemibody paresthesia, dysphagia, and ataxia. He also reported a single episode of binocular diplopia that lasted for 1 day and resolved spontaneously. Otherwise, his medical history is unremarkable. On physical examination, there was mild right-sided ptosis and miosis. Pain and temperature sensation were not evaluated. After instilling 10% topical cocaine eyedrops, the right pupil did not change its size whereas the left pupil dilated by 2 mm, supporting a diagnosis of right-sided Horner syndrome. With the exception of delayed initiation of saccades, extraocular motility was full, and there was no nystagmus.

The differential diagnosis for Horner syndrome includes a variety of conditions, both benign and malignant. The most common causes are tumors of the sympathetic nervous system, such as a carotid body tumor or a neuroblastoma. Other causes include head and neck trauma, stroke, and multiple sclerosis.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system. The right-sided hemibody paresthesia, dysphagia, and ataxia suggest that the tumor is located in the upper cervical region. The binocular diplopia that resolved spontaneously suggests that the tumor is small and not compressing the brainstem.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine. These studies will help to identify the location and extent of the tumor. If a tumor is found, further testing, such as a biopsy, may be necessary to determine the type of tumor and the best course of treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform a lumbar puncture and measure opening pressure and cerebrospinal fluid composition is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs that suggest a cerebrospinal fluid abnormality.
* C. Perform an apraclonidine test to confirm diagnosis of Horner syndrome is incorrect because the patient already has a diagnosis of Horner syndrome based on his history, physical examination, and the cocaine eyedrop test.
* D. Order tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and syphilis serologies is incorrect because these tests are not specific for Horner syndrome and would not be helpful in the diagnosis or management of this patient.

 70%|███████   | 1069/1525 [4:22:28<1:48:56, 14.34s/it]The correct answer is C. Initiate steroid pulse therapy.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute giant cell myocarditis, a rare but potentially fatal inflammatory condition of the heart muscle. The characteristic findings on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) are diffuse epicardial involvement and extensive myocardial edema. These findings, in combination with the patient's history of progressive shortness of breath, fluctuating troponin levels, and low left ventricular ejection fraction, make the diagnosis of acute giant cell myocarditis highly likely.

The treatment of acute giant cell myocarditis is typically with high-dose steroids, such as methylprednisolone. Pulse therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone is often used initially, followed by a tapering course of oral steroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, may also be used.

Early diagnosis and treatment of acute giant cell myocarditis can improve the prognosis for patients with this condition. However, even with treatment, some patients may experience long-term heart problems, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Conduct close follow-up and provide medical treatment is not a specific enough treatment plan. The patient's condition is potentially life-threatening, and she requires more aggressive treatment than close follow-up and medical treatment alone.
* B. Perform positron emission tomographic/CT imaging to guide steroid treatment is not necessary in this case. The diagnosis of acute giant cell myocarditis is already clear, and there is no evidence that positron emission tomographic/CT imaging would provide any additional information that would alter the treatment plan.
* D. Perform serum and urine immunofixation and light chain determination is not necessary in this case. The patient's presentation is not consistent with any of the conditions that would be diagnosed with these tests, such as multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

Chondroblastic osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that starts in the cartilage cells of the bone. Chondrosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that starts in the cartilage cells of the bone. Malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland is a type of cancer that starts in the glands that produce saliva.

The patient in the case presented with a 3-month history of painful swelling of the left hard palate and cheek. The growth also caused malocclusion and ipsilateral upper lip numbness. She reported no recent trauma; no difficulty speaking, breathing, or swallowing; no epistaxis, nasal congestion or nasal drainage; and no recent fevers. She did have a history of recent pericoronitis, but several courses of antibiotics were unhelpful. Physical examination revealed a submucosal growth centered on the mesial aspect of the left maxillary alveolus. Transnasal endoscopy was unremarkable. Contrasted computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously ossified lesion filling the left maxillary sinus, with local destruction of hard palate and alveolar bone. Positron emission tomographic scans highlighted the fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nature of both the tumor and associated cervical lymphadenopathy. A biopsy showed a tumor with lobular architecture, an incomplete peripheral ossified rim, and focal areas of osteoid matrix. Higher power showed atypical cells with increased mitotic activity in a myxoid stroma. Immunostains were negative for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP.

The imaging findings are consistent with a malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor. Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumors are rare, mesenchymal neoplasms that occur most commonly in the soft tissues of the extremities, but can also occur in the head and neck. They are characterized by a lobular growth pattern, with an incomplete peripheral ossified rim and focal areas of osteoid matrix. Histologically, they are composed of spindle-shaped cells in a myxoid stroma, with occasional multinucleated giant cells. Immunohistochemically, they are negative for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP.

The patient in the case presented with a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor. These include the age of the patient (30s), the location of the tumor (hard palate), the clinical presentation (painful swelling, malocclusion, ipsilateral upper lip numbness), the imaging findings (heterogeneously ossified lesion filling the left maxillary sinus, with local destruction of hard palate and alveolar bone), and the histopathologic findings (lobular architecture, an incomplete peripheral ossified rim, and focal areas of osteoid matrix).

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Chondroblastic osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that starts in the cartilage cells of the bone. The patient in the case presented with a tumor that was located in the soft tissues of the hard palate, not in the bone.
* Chondrosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that starts in the cartilage cells of the bone. The patient in the case presented with a tumor that was located in the soft tissues of the hard palate, not in the bone.
* Malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland is a type of cancer that starts in the glands that produce saliva. The patient in the case presented with a tumor that was located in the hard palate, not in the salivary glands.

 70%|███████   | 1071/1525 [4:22:53<1:45:09, 13.90s/it]The correct answer is A. Lipoma.

A lipoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor of fat cells. It is the most common soft tissue tumor, and it can occur anywhere in the body. Lipomas are usually soft, movable, and painless. They are often found in the neck, shoulder, back, and abdomen.

The patient in the case presented with a large, irregular pedunculated mass on the left anterior false vocal fold. The mass was seen to ball-valve in and out of the glottis with respiration. This is consistent with a diagnosis of lipoma.

Vocal cord polyps are benign tumors that arise from the vocal cords. They are usually caused by vocal abuse, such as from excessive shouting or singing. Vocal cord polyps can cause hoarseness, breathiness, and pain.

Squamous papillomas are benign tumors that arise from the squamous epithelium of the vocal cords. They are usually caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Squamous papillomas can cause hoarseness, breathiness, and pain.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare, malignant (cancerous) tumor of the salivary glands. It can occur anywhere in the salivary glands, but it is most common in the parotid gland. Adenoid cystic carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body.

In the case presented, the patient had a large, irregular pedunculated mass on the left anterior false vocal fold. The mass was seen to ball-valve in and out of the glottis with respiration. This is consistent with a diagnosis of lipoma. The other choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's presentation.

A fungus ball is a mass of fungal hyphae that can form in the sinuses. It is typically seen in patients with chronic sinusitis, and is often associated with diabetes or other immune suppression. The patient in this case does not have any of these risk factors, and the CT scan shows no evidence of a fungus ball.

Cerebrospinal fluid leak with sinusitis is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid leaks from the brain into the sinuses. It can cause headache, facial pain, and rhinorrhea. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, and the CT scan does not show any evidence of a cerebrospinal fluid leak.

Hypervascular metastasis from thyroid cancer is a condition in which thyroid cancer spreads to the bones. It can cause pain, swelling, and bleeding in the bones. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, and the CT scan does not show any evidence of metastasis.

The patient in this case has a history of minor head trauma 15 years earlier. This could have caused a tear in the internal carotid artery, which could have led to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm. The CT scan shows a double-lined appearance of the sinus walls, which is consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. The MRI scan shows a concentric multistratified appearance of the sinus content, which is also consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. After gadolinium administration, volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) sequences revealed very intense enhancement of the oval black area in the upper part of the sinus, with no contrast enhancement of the remainder of the sinus. This is also consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. On paracoronal images, there was no cleavage plane between the hyperenhancing area in the sphenoid sinus and the bright signal of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in the cavernous sinus. This suggests that the pseudoaneurysm is directly related to the ICA.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, non-malignant disorder of the lymphatic system that is characterized by lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and angiofollicular hyperplasia. It is most common in young men of Southeast Asian descent.

The clinical features of Kimura disease vary depending on the stage of the disease. The initial stage is characterized by a localized lymphadenopathy, often with associated skin changes such as erythema, edema, and ulceration. In the later stages of the disease, there may be systemic involvement, including hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary infiltrates, and bone marrow involvement.

The diagnosis of Kimura disease is made based on clinical findings and supported by histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. The characteristic histopathologic features of Kimura disease include angiofollicular hyperplasia, eosinophilic infiltrates, and fibrosis.

There is no cure for Kimura disease, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment options include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of this case.

Castleman disease is a rare, benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue. It is most common in middle-aged adults.

A laryngeal saccular cyst is a benign, slow-growing, cystic mass that arises from the saccular recess of the laryngeal ventricle. It is the most common type of laryngeal cyst, accounting for approximately 60% of all laryngeal cysts.

Laryngeal saccular cysts typically present in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. They are more common in men than women. The most common symptom is hoarseness, which is usually mild and intermittent. Other symptoms may include a foreign body sensation in the throat, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

The diagnosis of laryngeal saccular cyst is made on the basis of history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Flexible laryngoscopy is usually the first step in the evaluation. This procedure allows the physician to visualize the larynx and identify the cyst. Computed tomography (CT) scan may be helpful in further defining the size and location of the cyst.

The treatment of laryngeal saccular cyst is surgical excision. This procedure can be performed under local or general anesthesia. The cyst is removed through an incision in the neck. The incision is usually small and heals quickly.

The prognosis for laryngeal saccular cyst is excellent. The vast majority of patients have a good outcome after surgery. The voice usually returns to normal within a few weeks of surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient. Laryngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the larynx. It is the most common type of cancer of the larynx. Laryngeal carcinoma typically presents with hoarseness that is progressive and does not improve with rest. Other symptoms may include dyspnea, dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss.

Laryngocele is a cystic mass that arises from the laryngeal ventricle. It is more common in men than women. The most common symptom is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a foreign body sensation in the throat, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

Thyroid cartilage chondroma is a benign tumor of the thyroid cartilage. It is the most common type of tumor of the thyroid cartilage. Thyroid cartilage chondroma typically presents with hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a neck mass, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

A. Cytomegalovirus infection is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have any risk factors for this infection, such as a weakened immune system. Additionally, the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of cytomegalovirus infection, which is fever, malaise, and fatigue.

B. Lymphomatous polyposis is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have any risk factors for this condition, such as a family history of lymphoma or a history of exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of lymphomatous polyposis, which is abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.

D. Ischemic colitis is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have any risk factors for this condition, such as atherosclerosis or atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of ischemic colitis, which is abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool.

The patient's history of follicular lymphoma and treatment with idelalisib makes idelalisib-induced colitis the most likely diagnosis. Idelalisib is a kinase inhibitor that is used to treat follicular lymphoma. It can cause a variety of side effects, including diarrhea, colitis, and pancreatitis. The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool, are consistent with idelalisib-induced colitis. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including normal hematological indices, renal function, and hepatic function, are consistent with idelalisib-induced colitis. The patient's imaging studies, including computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, are also consistent with idelalisib-induced colitis. The patient's biopsy results, which showed grossly congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectosigmoid and descending colon, are also consistent with idelalisib-induced colitis.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is C. Idelalisib-induced colitis.

 71%|███████   | 1076/1525 [4:24:13<1:55:10, 15.39s/it]The correct answer is C. Measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with porphyria cutanea tarda, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by photosensitivity, skin fragility, and blistering. Porphyria cutanea tarda is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which is responsible for the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of uroporphyrinogen III in the liver, which is then excreted in the urine.

The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda is confirmed by measuring the levels of uroporphyrinogen III and coproporphyrinogen III in the urine and serum. Treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda is aimed at reducing the levels of uroporphyrinogen III in the liver. This can be achieved by reducing alcohol intake, discontinuing certain medications, and taking photoprotective measures. In some cases, treatment with a drug called hydroxychloroquine may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A. Check serum bullous pemphigoid antibody titers is not the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder that causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes.
* B. Discontinue lisinopril is not the correct answer because lisinopril is not a medication that is known to cause porphyria cutanea tarda.
* D. Swab lesions and send for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus (ie, hand-foot-mouth disease) is not the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with hand-foot-mouth disease. Hand-foot-mouth disease is a viral infection that causes blisters on the hands, feet, and mouth.

The patient's history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, new onset of cough with blood-streaked sputum, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are all consistent with MPA. On examination, the patient's dyspnea, diffuse crackles at the lung bases, and 2+ pitting edema of the legs are also consistent with MPA. Laboratory evaluation showed a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL from a baseline of 10.4 g/dL, a creatinine level of 6.5 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL, and normal white blood cell count, platelets, and lactate. Urinalysis showed the presence of red blood cells but no protein. Chest x-ray showed new bilateral opacities. Computed tomographic imaging of the chest showed moderate stable fibrosis with multiple ground-glass opacities in the left lung. Based on these results, additional studies were performed, including a positive ANCA test. ANCA tests are used to diagnose autoimmune diseases, such as MPA. The patient's positive ANCA test is consistent with the diagnosis of MPA.

The patient does not have pneumonia with sepsis. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, while sepsis is a systemic infection that can lead to organ failure. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest pneumonia or sepsis.

The patient does not have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest SLE.

The patient does not have antiglomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture syndrome). Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that attacks the kidneys and lungs. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest Goodpasture syndrome.

 71%|███████   | 1078/1525 [4:24:43<1:51:45, 15.00s/it]The correct answer is B. Follicular psoriasis.

Follicular psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, autoimmune skin disease characterized by erythematous, scaly papules and plaques that are often follicular in distribution. The lesions are typically located on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, scalp, and lumbosacral area. Follicular psoriasis can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and thyroid disease.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a history of multiple small, 1.5-cm monomorphic and somewhat octagonal groupings of folliculocentric, erythematous, scaly, and hyperkeratotic papules at different stages of development distributed across arms, legs, trunk, and buttocks. The patient also has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and insulin-like growth factor 1 deficiency, which are both risk factors for follicular psoriasis. The physical examination findings are consistent with follicular psoriasis, and the biopsy specimen shows features of psoriasis, including parakeratosis, acanthosis, and Munro microabscesses.

The differential diagnosis for follicular psoriasis includes follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris, follicular mucinosis, and follicular lymphomatoid papulosis. Follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris is a chronic, relapsing, autoimmune skin disease characterized by erythematous, scaly papules and plaques that are often follicular in distribution. The lesions are typically located on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, scalp, and lumbosacral area. Follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and thyroid disease. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any of the characteristic features of follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris, such as the "dirty collar" sign or the "carpet tack sign."

Follicular mucinosis is a rare, chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the hair follicles. The lesions are typically located on the face, neck, and upper trunk. Follicular mucinosis can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any of the characteristic features of follicular mucinosis, such as the "peau d'orange" sign or the "violaceous papules."

Follicular lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic, non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the eruption of papules and nodules on the skin. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities. Follicular lymphomatoid papulosis is usually self-limited, but it can occasionally progress to a more aggressive lymphoma. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any of the characteristic features of follicular lymphomatoid papulosis, such as the "targetoid lesions" or the "follicular mucinosis."

In conclusion, the patient in the case presentation presents with a history and physical examination consistent with follicular psoriasis. The biopsy specimen also shows features of psoriasis. The differential diagnosis for follicular psoriasis includes follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris, follicular mucinosis, and follicular lymphomatoid papulosis. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any of the characteristic features of these other diseases. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. Follicular psoriasis.

Neurofibromatosis type I is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerve tissue. It is characterized by multiple café-au-lait spots, freckling in the armpits and groin, and Lisch nodules (small, raised bumps on the iris). Neurofibromatosis type I is not associated with painful nodules on the jawline.

Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on the skin, hair follicles, and kidneys. It is characterized by multiple fibrofolliculomas (small, raised bumps on the skin), trichodiscomas (small, raised bumps on the hair follicles), and renal cysts (fluid-filled sacs in the kidneys). Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is not associated with painful nodules on the jawline.

Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on the brain, kidneys, skin, heart, and eyes. It is characterized by seizures, developmental delays, facial angiofibromas (small, raised bumps on the face), and ash leaf spots (small, white patches on the skin). Tuberous sclerosis is not associated with painful nodules on the jawline.

Reed syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes painful nodules to grow on the skin. It is characterized by multiple painful nodules on the skin, particularly on the extremities. Reed syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the protein folliculin. Folliculin is a protein that is important for the development of hair follicles. A mutation in folliculin can cause hair follicles to grow abnormally, which can lead to the formation of painful nodules.

The patient in the case presented with a 3-year history of painful nodules on her lower extremities, neck, and jawline. She also had a solitary 8-mm skin-colored nodule on the right jawline and three 2- to 3-cm pink firm nodules on the right thigh. These findings are consistent with Reed syndrome. The patient's medical history and physical examination do not support a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type I, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is Reed syndrome.

Granuloma annulare is a common skin condition that is characterized by small, raised, red or skin-colored bumps. The bumps often form rings or arcs on the skin, and they may be itchy or painful. Granuloma annulare is usually harmless, but it can sometimes be disfiguring.

Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is a rare skin condition that is characterized by large, raised, red or skin-colored plaques. The plaques often have a raised, nodular border and a clear, atrophic center. Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma can be painful or itchy, and it can sometimes cause scarring.

Annular lichen planus is a common skin condition that is characterized by small, flat, red or skin-colored bumps. The bumps often form rings or arcs on the skin, and they may be itchy or painful. Annular lichen planus is usually harmless, but it can sometimes be disfiguring.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare skin condition that is characterized by raised, red or skin-colored plaques. The plaques often have a yellowish center and a raised, nodular border. Necrobiosis lipoidica can be painful or itchy, and it can sometimes cause scarring.

In this case, the patient has a large, annular plaque with raised borders and an atrophic and wrinkled center on her right arm. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma. The biopsy specimen shows a characteristic pattern of destruction of elastic fibers, which is also consistent with annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical presentation of the patient's lesion. Granuloma annulare is characterized by small, raised, red or skin-colored bumps, not large, annular plaques. Annular lichen planus is characterized by small, flat, red or skin-colored bumps, not large, annular plaques.

 71%|███████   | 1081/1525 [4:25:29<1:53:25, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Neonatal varicella syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when a pregnant woman with no immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) contracts the virus during her third trimester or at the time of delivery. The virus can then be transmitted to the fetus, causing a variety of problems, including skin rash, pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis. The rash is typically widespread and vesicular, and it often involves the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. In this case, the patient's mother was varicella nonimmune and had no active rashes including in the perineal area, so neonatal varicella syndrome is not the most likely diagnosis.

Disseminated herpes infection is a serious condition that can occur in newborns who are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy, during delivery, or after delivery through contact with infected secretions. The most common symptoms of disseminated herpes infection in newborns are fever, irritability, and poor feeding. The skin rash is typically widespread and vesicular, and it often involves the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. In this case, the patient's mother was not known to have HSV, and the patient did not have any of the typical symptoms of disseminated herpes infection, so disseminated herpes infection is not the most likely diagnosis.

Congenital syphilis is a serious condition that can occur in newborns who are infected with Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The bacteria can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy through the placenta. The most common symptoms of congenital syphilis in newborns are skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and central nervous system involvement. The skin rash is typically widespread and papular, and it often involves the palms, soles, and oral mucosa. In this case, the patient's mother was not known to have syphilis, and the patient did not have any of the typical symptoms of congenital syphilis, so congenital syphilis is not the most likely diagnosis.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder of the immune system that occurs when white blood cells called Langerhans cells accumulate in the tissues. LCH can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the bones, skin, and lymph nodes. The symptoms of LCH vary depending on the affected organs. In this case, the patient has a widespread papulovesicular, crusted rash that involves the arms, legs, face, scalp, and trunk. The palms, soles, and oral mucosa are spared. This is a typical presentation of LCH, so it is the most likely diagnosis.

The patient had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, during which a large stone in the gallbladder was spilled into the abdomen. Not all the spilled stones could be retrieved. Two weeks later, he was evaluated for persistent mild abdominal pain in clinic. CT of the abdomen showed a 2.5-cm calcified mass with adjacent inflammatory changes in the left hemiabdomen that was most consistent with a lost gallstone. One month later, he returned to the emergency department with a 2-day history of progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Laboratory findings were unremarkable. A second abdominal CT was performed, which showed a dilated small bowel loop with a stone impacted at the ileocecal valve.

These findings are most consistent with gallstone ileus. Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis (gallstones) that occurs when a gallstone passes through the common bile duct and obstructs the small bowel. The most common site of obstruction is the ileocecal valve. The patient's history of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a lost gallstone, the CT findings of a dilated small bowel loop with a stone impacted at the ileocecal valve, and the absence of other findings that could explain his symptoms are all consistent with the diagnosis of gallstone ileus.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Intra-abdominal abscess: This is a collection of pus that forms in the abdomen. It is not a common complication of gallstone ileus. The patient's CT findings do not show any evidence of an intra-abdominal abscess.
* Gallstone granuloma: This is a small, inflammatory mass that can form around a gallstone. It is not a common cause of abdominal pain. The patient's CT findings do not show any evidence of a gallstone granuloma.
* Eroded gallstone into the abdominal wall: This is a rare complication of gallstone disease. It is not a common cause of abdominal pain. The patient's CT findings do not show any evidence of an eroded gallstone into the abdominal wall.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Gallstone ileus. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. The other answer choices are incorrect for the reasons listed above.

The physical examination findings are consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst, including a nontender, nonpulsatile, fixed lump in the upper abdomen. The laboratory findings are also consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst, including leukocytosis and an elevated serum amylase level. The CT scan findings are diagnostic of a pancreatic pseudocyst, showing a homogeneous collection of fluid encysted by a well-defined enhancing wall.

Mesenteric cysts are rare, benign lesions that can occur anywhere in the mesentery. They are typically asymptomatic and are often found incidentally on imaging studies. Gastric duplication cysts are rare, congenital lesions that can occur anywhere in the stomach. They are typically asymptomatic and are often found incidentally on imaging studies. Walled-off pancreatic necrosis is a complication of acute pancreatitis that occurs when necrotic pancreatic tissue becomes walled off by fibrous tissue.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A, Continue to observe and hope the implant settles down or moves away from the visual axis, is incorrect because the implant has been in the visual axis for 2 weeks and has not moved. It is unlikely that it will move on its own.
* Option B, Inject an intravitreous gas bubble to displace the implant, is incorrect because the implant is in the middle of the vitreous cavity and a gas bubble would not be able to displace it.
* Option D, Perform a pars plana vitrectomy to displace or remove the implant, is incorrect because a pars plana vitrectomy is a major surgery with a significant risk of complications. It should only be performed if the other options are not possible.

Using a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser to release the implant is a minimally invasive procedure with a low risk of complications. The laser is used to create a small opening in the implant, which allows the medication to be released and the implant to float out of the visual axis. This procedure is often successful in relieving the patient's symptoms and improving their vision.

The patient has a dislocated lens in both eyes. This is a serious condition that can lead to loss of vision if not treated. The most common treatment for a dislocated lens is lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement.

In a lensectomy, the surgeon removes the lens from the eye. In an anterior vitrectomy, the surgeon removes the vitreous humor, a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. The surgeon then places an intraocular lens (IOL) in the eye. The IOL is a clear plastic lens that replaces the natural lens.

Lensectomies with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement are a safe and effective treatment for a dislocated lens. The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia. The patient will need to stay in the hospital for a few days after surgery.

The most common risks of lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement are infection, bleeding, and retinal detachment. These risks are rare, but they can be serious. The patient should talk to their doctor about the risks and benefits of the surgery before making a decision.

After surgery, the patient will need to wear an eye shield to protect their eyes. They will also need to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks. The patient should follow their doctor's instructions carefully to ensure a successful outcome.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Pharmacologically redilate the pupils and position the patient supinely: This is not a treatment for a dislocated lens. It may be used to dilate the pupils for a diagnostic procedure, but it will not treat the underlying condition.
* C. Refer the patient for connective tissue disease workup: This is not a necessary treatment for a dislocated lens. The patient does not have any symptoms of a connective tissue disease.
* D. Observe and reevaluate the patient in 2 months: This is not an appropriate treatment for a dislocated lens. The patient needs to have surgery to remove the dislocated lens.

The eyelids, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens were unremarkable in both eyes. Fundus examination of the right eye was normal. The fundus examination of the left eye revealed the findings shown in Figure 1.

A leukocoria is a white pupillary reflex that can be caused by a variety of conditions, including retinoblastoma, cataracts, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), and Coats' disease. Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina that is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. It is a rare disease, with an incidence of 1 in 15,000 live births. Retinoblastoma can be diagnosed at any age, but it is most commonly diagnosed in children under the age of 2 years. The most common presenting sign of retinoblastoma is leukocoria. Other signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma may include strabismus (crossed eyes), a red eye, and decreased vision.

The initial management of a child with leukocoria is to obtain a complete ophthalmologic examination, including a dilated fundus examination. If a retinoblastoma is suspected, further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head and orbits, may be necessary to determine the extent of the tumor. Treatment of retinoblastoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, treatment may include cryotherapy, laser therapy, or chemotherapy. In more advanced disease, enucleation (removal of the eye) may be necessary.

The patient in this case has a leukocoria and decreased vision in his left eye. The fundus examination of his left eye reveals a white-yellow mass lesion in the macula. This is highly suggestive of retinoblastoma. The next step in management is to examine the patient under anesthesia with peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser. This will allow the ophthalmologist to better assess the extent of the tumor and to plan treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option A, obtain a magnetic resonance image of the brain and orbits and treat with chemotherapy, is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of brain involvement. Option C, inject an intravitreous anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication, is incorrect because this treatment is not effective for retinoblastoma. Option D, perform genetic testing, is incorrect because genetic testing is not necessary for the diagnosis or management of retinoblastoma.

 71%|███████▏  | 1087/1525 [4:26:52<1:37:29, 13.36s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy.

A is incorrect because observing the lesion at yearly intervals is not enough to rule out malignancy. The lesion is gradually enlarging, and it is important to obtain more information about its nature and extent before making a decision about management.

C is incorrect because performing a transcorneal biopsy of the lesion is not a safe or accurate way to diagnose a suspected iris tumor. The biopsy could damage the eye and could introduce infection.

D is incorrect because completely excising the lesion with pathological analysis is a very aggressive treatment option that should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of the lesion. In this case, it is important to obtain more information about the lesion before making a decision about management.

High-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a safe and accurate way to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye. It can be used to visualize the iris, ciliary body, and angle structures in great detail. UBM can also be used to obtain tissue samples for biopsy. In this case, UBM would be a valuable tool for evaluating the nature and extent of the lesion. It would also allow the doctor to obtain a tissue sample for biopsy if necessary.

After obtaining more information about the lesion, the doctor can make a more informed decision about the best course of management.

 71%|███████▏  | 1088/1525 [4:27:08<1:43:15, 14.18s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform ECG with right precordial leads.

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of heart failure due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes. He presented with substernal chest pressure of 1-hour duration, radiating to his left arm and occurring at rest. The electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation revealed atrial fibrillation: concave upward ST-segment elevations of more than 1 mm in the inferior leads, more prominent in lead III than lead II, along with reciprocal ST-segment depressions in the anterior precordial leads. This was suggestive of an acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction (MI), likely from complete occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The coronary angiogram (Figure 1A) confirmed this finding. The left main, the left anterior descending, and the left circumflex coronary arteries were normal. A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the mid-RCA occlusion just distal to the right ventricular branch was performed. After the PCI, the chest pain resolved, but the patient’s blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. Another ECG (Figure 1B) demonstrated resolution of the ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads with a new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3.

The new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3 is suggestive of right ventricular infarction (RVMI). RVMI is a complication of inferior MI that occurs in up to 20% of cases. It is caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery, which supplies blood to the right ventricle. RVMI can lead to right ventricular failure, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform an ECG with right precordial leads. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of RVMI and to assess the severity of the infarction. If RVMI is confirmed, the patient will need to be treated with supportive measures, such as fluids, diuretics, and inotropic agents. In some cases, mechanical ventilation may also be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not provide any additional information or benefit to the patient.

A. Perform bedside echocardiography: Bedside echocardiography can be used to assess the function of the left ventricle, but it cannot be used to assess the function of the right ventricle.

B. Perform another coronary angiography: Another coronary angiography would not be necessary at this time, as the patient has already undergone a PCI.

C. Perform ECG using posterior leads: ECG using posterior leads would not provide any additional information, as the patient already has a new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3.

 71%|███████▏  | 1089/1525 [4:27:22<1:43:04, 14.18s/it]The correct answer is B. Teratoma.

A teratoma is a type of germ cell tumor that can develop in any part of the body, but is most common in the ovaries, testicles, and sacrococcygeal region. Teratomas are made up of a variety of tissues, including skin, hair, teeth, and bone. They can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

The patient in this case presented with a large neck mass that was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. The mass continued to grow after birth, and the patient was eventually taken to the operating room for resection of the mass and tracheostomy. Pathologic results showed a multinodular 19-cm mass, 80% solid and 20% cystic, with multiple tissue types present. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of teratoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphatic malformation: Lymphatic malformations are benign tumors that arise from the lymphatic system. They are most common in the head and neck region, and can present as a soft, fluctuant mass. Lymphatic malformations are typically not associated with skin necrosis or other signs of malignancy.
* Venous malformation: Venous malformations are benign tumors that arise from the venous system. They are most common in the head and neck region, and can present as a soft, compressible mass. Venous malformations are typically not associated with skin necrosis or other signs of malignancy.
* Dermoid cyst: Dermoid cysts are benign tumors that arise from the skin. They are most common in the head and neck region, and can present as a soft, fluctuant mass. Dermoid cysts are typically not associated with skin necrosis or other signs of malignancy.

 71%|███████▏  | 1090/1525 [4:27:39<1:47:10, 14.78s/it]The correct answer is B. Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KOT).

KOT is a benign odontogenic tumor that is thought to arise from the epithelial rests of Malassez. It is the most common odontogenic tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all odontogenic tumors. KOT is most commonly seen in young adults, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. It is slightly more common in males than females.

KOT typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the jaw. The mass may be associated with tooth displacement or loss. Radiographically, KOT appears as a well-defined, unilocular or multilocular radiolucency. The lesion may be expansile and may cause cortical thinning or perforation.

The diagnosis of KOT is made based on clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. The characteristic histopathologic features of KOT include a proliferation of odontogenic epithelium with keratinization and parakeratosis. The lesion may also contain islands of odontogenic ectomesenchyme.

The treatment of KOT is surgical excision. The goal of surgery is to achieve complete removal of the lesion with clear margins. Recurrence rates are low after complete excision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is not associated with the teeth.
* Cystic ameloblastoma is a locally aggressive odontogenic tumor that is not typically cystic.
* Cystic schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that is not associated with the teeth.

 72%|███████▏  | 1091/1525 [4:27:55<1:50:15, 15.24s/it]The correct diagnosis is metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient's history of stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the ipsilateral adrenal gland treated with radical nephrectomy is highly suggestive of metastatic disease. The physical examination findings of soft, tender nodules at the forehead and right orbit with right proptosis are also consistent with metastatic disease. The sinus computed tomography showed a soft-tissue mass with involvement of multiple craniofacial bones with orbital, anterior, and posterior table defects. This is a typical finding in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The magnetic resonance imaging with contrast showed interval growth at the frontal bones in the region of previously diagnosed FD. This is also a typical finding in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy established the diagnosis. Romanowsky-stained direct smears showed loose billowing clusters of epithelial cells involved by strands of magenta extracellular tissue. Cytoplasm was abundant with coarse and fine textures. Nuclei were large and round, occasionally with conspicuous nucleoli. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and nuclei with varying nucleolar prominence. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10 and PAX-8. A carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) stain was noncontributory. These findings are consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

The other choices are incorrect. Locally aggressive fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone tumor that does not typically metastasize. Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. Metastatic breast adenocarcinoma is a common malignancy that can metastasize to the bones, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

 72%|███████▏  | 1092/1525 [4:28:12<1:53:08, 15.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the basal cells of the skin. It is the most common type of skin cancer, and it is usually not life-threatening. Squamous cell carcinoma is another type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells of the skin. It is less common than basal cell carcinoma, but it is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.

Eccrine syringofibroadenoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that arises from the eccrine sweat glands. It is usually a small, solitary lesion that is found on the face or neck. Syringofibroadenocarcinoma is a rare, malignant (cancerous) tumor that also arises from the eccrine sweat glands. It is usually a larger, more aggressive tumor that can spread to other parts of the body.

In the case presented, the patient had a 2.5 × 2-cm, singular, umbilicated, ulcerated papular lesion of the left temple with overlying crusts and surrounding erythema and induration. Computed tomography with contrast of the soft tissue revealed an abnormal mass in the site of the left temporal scalp lesion. The mass appeared homogenous and was not particularly enhanced by contrast. There was no accompanying surrounding lymphadenopathy. A preoperative biopsy and low-power histological analysis revealed an epidermal proliferative process; vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium were seen arising from multiple points along the epidermis. In this case, there was concurrent well-differentiated carcinoma. Ductal differentiation was observed on high power, and the mass had an intervening fibrovascular stroma.

The clinical and pathological findings in this case are most consistent with a diagnosis of eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The eccrine syringofibroadenoma component of the tumor is a benign lesion that is characterized by the proliferation of eccrine sweat gland ducts and glands. The squamous cell carcinoma component of the tumor is a malignant lesion that is characterized by the proliferation of atypical squamous cells.

The differential diagnosis for this case includes basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and eccrine poroma. Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the basal cells of the skin. It is the most common type of skin cancer, and it is usually not life-threatening. Squamous cell carcinoma is another type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells of the skin. It is less common than basal cell carcinoma, but it is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Eccrine poroma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that arises from the eccrine sweat glands. It is usually a small, solitary lesion that is found on the palms or soles of the feet.

The clinical and pathological findings in this case are not consistent with a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is usually a small, papular lesion that is found on the face or neck. Squamous cell carcinoma is usually a larger, more aggressive tumor that can spread to other parts of the body. Eccrine poroma is usually a small, solitary lesion that is found on the palms or soles of the feet.

 72%|███████▏  | 1093/1525 [4:28:28<1:55:15, 16.01s/it]The correct answer is D. Epithelioid sarcoma. The patient is a man in his 20s with a 9-month history of a nonhealing submental ulcer. The ulcer is located within old scar tissue and has an infiltrative growth pattern. Microscopically there are epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with areas of necrosis. Tumor cells stained strongly positive for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin and demonstrated loss of INI-1 immunostaining.

Ulcerated squamous cell carcinoma is a common malignancy of the skin and oral cavity. It is typically a well-defined, raised lesion with an ulcerated surface. The tumor cells are typically keratinized and stain positive for cytokeratins.

Histiocytoma is a benign tumor of histiocytes. It is typically a soft, well-defined mass that can occur anywhere in the body. The tumor cells are typically histiocytes, which are cells that are involved in the immune system.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign tumor of fibroblasts. It is typically a soft, well-defined mass that can occur anywhere in the body. The tumor cells are typically fibroblasts, which are cells that produce collagen.

Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin. It typically occurs in young adults and is often located in the extremities. The tumor cells are typically epithelioid or spindle-shaped and stain positive for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin. They also demonstrate loss of INI-1 immunostaining.

The most important feature in the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma is the loss of INI-1 immunostaining. INI-1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in many types of cancer. Loss of INI-1 immunostaining is a characteristic feature of epithelioid sarcoma.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not typically present with a nonhealing ulcer that is located within old scar tissue and has an infiltrative growth pattern. Additionally, the tumor cells in these other tumors do not typically stain positive for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin and demonstrate loss of INI-1 immunostaining.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone that helps the body respond to stress and regulate blood sugar levels. Symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency can include fatigue, weight loss, darkening of the skin, and low blood pressure.

A 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test is a test that is used to diagnose primary adrenal insufficiency. The test is done by injecting a person with a hormone called corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. If the adrenal glands are not producing enough cortisol, the person's blood cortisol level will not increase after the injection of ACTH.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

A. Evaluate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia with serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disorder that causes the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. Symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can include ambiguous genitalia, early puberty, and excessive hair growth. The test for congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a blood test to measure the level of 17-hydroxyprogesterone.

C. Evaluate for a pituitary adenoma with magnetic resonance imaging. A pituitary adenoma is a tumor that grows on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small gland in the brain that produces hormones that control many body functions, including cortisol production. Symptoms of a pituitary adenoma can include headache, vision problems, and changes in hormone levels. The test for a pituitary adenoma is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.

D. Evaluate for a laboratory error by repeating tests for serum adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol. A laboratory error is a mistake that is made during a laboratory test. Symptoms of a laboratory error can include a test result that is not accurate or a test result that is out of the normal range. The test for a laboratory error is to repeat the test.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Evaluate for primary adrenal insufficiency with a 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare, inherited disorder of the blood vessels that causes sudden swelling of the skin, tissues under the skin, and mucous membranes. It is not caused by sun exposure.

Urticarial vasculitis is a type of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. It is characterized by hives that last for more than 24 hours and can leave scars. It is not caused by sun exposure.

Acrodynia is a rare condition that causes inflammation and pain in the extremities, especially the hands and feet. It is often seen in children and is caused by exposure to certain metals, such as mercury. It is not caused by sun exposure.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria is a rare, inherited disorder of the heme biosynthesis pathway. It is characterized by skin sensitivity to sunlight, abdominal pain, and neurologic symptoms. The skin lesions are typically photodistributed, meaning that they occur in areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun. The lesions are often described as being tender, petechial, and edematous. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of protoporphyrin in the blood and urine.

The patient in the case presented with hand and foot swelling and pain in areas of sun exposure after playing golf outside. She had a history of similar yet milder skin eruptions with sun exposure over the prior 2 years. No other family members were similarly affected. The physical examination findings were notable for acral edema and well-demarcated, tender petechial patches on the dorsal surface of the hands and feet. No vesicles were noted. A punch biopsy specimen from the affected area of her hand was obtained. The clinical images show edema with petechial eruption on the hands and feet. The pathologic images show subtle thickening of vessel walls, in addition to extravasation of erythrocytes and fibrin thrombus formation.

The patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of erythropoietic protoporphyria. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the lips, tongue, and face. It is characterized by swelling of the lips, tongue, and face, as well as facial pain and numbness. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is not associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by inflammation, ulceration, and scarring of the bowel wall. Crohn disease is not associated with multiple mucosal neuromas.

Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, eyes, and nervous system. It is characterized by the accumulation of a fatty substance called lipoid proteinosis in the skin, eyes, and nervous system. Lipoid proteinosis is not associated with multiple mucosal neuromas.

Multiple mucosal neuromas in MEN 2B (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple neuromas (benign tumors of nerve tissue) in the lips, tongue, and other mucosal surfaces. It is also associated with pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal glands) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (a tumor of the thyroid gland).

The patient in the case presented with multiple asymptomatic lesions on her tongue that had gradually developed since the first years of life. She also had a marfanoid habitus, disproportion of limbs, and an enlarged face. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple mucosal neuromas in MEN 2B.

The patient's history of end-stage liver disease is a risk factor for disseminated tinea, which is a fungal infection of the skin. The skin lesions described in the case are consistent with disseminated tinea, which typically presents as multiple, coalescing papules and nodules with central black and hemorrhagic crusts. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with fever and lymphadenopathy. Disseminated tinea can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy, which will show fungal hyphae in the stratum corneum. Treatment is with oral antifungal medications, such as fluconazole or itraconazole.

Kaposi sarcoma is a rare cancer that is often seen in patients with HIV/AIDS. It can present as skin lesions, but these are typically violaceous macules or papules, not purple crusted nodules.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare infection caused by Bartonella henselae. It can present as skin lesions, but these are typically red, raised, and vascular lesions, not purple crusted nodules.

The patient's history of right-lung empyema with decortication 8 years prior is a risk factor for nocardial brain abscess. Nocardiosis is a rare, opportunistic infection caused by the bacteria Nocardia spp. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer, HIV infection, or chronic lung disease. The most common form of nocardiosis is pneumonia, but brain abscesses can also occur.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a brain abscess. He has a history of neurological symptoms, including slurred speech, left-sided facial droop, and numbness and weakness in his left arm. His neurological examination findings are also consistent with a brain abscess, including fluent but dysarthric speech, dysphagia, marked left facial droop, and difficulty with multistep commands. A motor examination revealed decreased left upper extremity strength (3/5 proximally and 4/5 distally), conspicuous loss of fine motor coordination, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesis.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with a brain abscess. Hemogram and inflammatory markers were within normal limits, but this is not uncommon in patients with brain abscesses. Carotid arteries were unremarkable via ultrasonography, which does not rule out a brain abscess.

The patient's imaging findings are consistent with a brain abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated an intra-axial necrotic lesion with adjacent vasculogenic edema primarily involving the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes. This is a classic appearance of a brain abscess.

In summary, the patient's history, presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging findings are all consistent with a brain abscess. The most likely cause of the brain abscess is Nocardia spp., given the patient's history of right-lung empyema with decortication. The other answer choices are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

A. Hemorrhagic brain infarct is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient. The patient's history is not consistent with a hemorrhagic stroke, and his imaging findings do not show evidence of a hemorrhage.

C. Metastatic carcinoma is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient. The patient's history is not consistent with metastatic cancer, and his imaging findings do not show evidence of a metastasis.

D. Mixed bacterial abscess is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient. The patient's history is not consistent with a mixed bacterial infection, and his imaging findings do not show evidence of a mixed bacterial abscess.

Acute lymphadenitis is a condition in which the lymph nodes become inflamed. It is usually caused by an infection, such as a cold or the flu. Symptoms of acute lymphadenitis include fever, pain, and swelling in the lymph nodes. In this case, the patient does not have any of the symptoms of acute lymphadenitis, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

Inguinal hernia is a condition in which a part of the intestine pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall. It is most common in men, but it can also occur in women. Symptoms of inguinal hernia include a bulge in the groin area, pain, and discomfort. In this case, the patient does not have any of the symptoms of inguinal hernia, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

Femoral hernia is a type of inguinal hernia that occurs in the groin area, near the femoral artery. It is more common in women than in men. Symptoms of femoral hernia include a bulge in the groin area, pain, and discomfort. In this case, the patient does not have any of the symptoms of femoral hernia, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

Obturator hernia is a rare type of hernia that occurs when a part of the intestine or other abdominal organ slips through a defect in the obturator foramen, a large opening in the pelvis. It is more common in women than in men. Symptoms of obturator hernia include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In this case, the patient has abdominal distention, nausea, and crampy abdominal pain, which are all symptoms of obturator hernia. Additionally, the patient's CT scan showed a mass lesion in the right lower pelvic wall, which is consistent with an obturator hernia. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D. Obturator hernia.

The patient's history of generalized weakness and bilateral lower extremity swelling that had progressed to his upper abdomen is consistent with a retroperitoneal mass. The physical examination findings of an abdomen that is large, taut, and distended are also consistent with a retroperitoneal mass. The computed tomographic scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows a large mass in the retroperitoneum that is displacing the descending colon to the right side and encasing the left kidney. The mass does not show evidence of hydronephrosis. These findings are most consistent with a liposarcoma.

Retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease) is a rare condition that is characterized by fibrosis of the retroperitoneal tissues. It is typically caused by an autoimmune reaction or an infection. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer. It is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with renal cell carcinoma.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract. It is typically caused by a mutation in the KIT gene. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with GIST.

The patient has extensive vitreous strands and veils, which are a known complication of vitrectomy. These strands can cause decreased vision by blocking light from reaching the retina. They can also cause inflammation and pain. Topical steroids are the first-line treatment for vitreous strands and veils. They help to reduce inflammation and promote the absorption of the strands.

Intravitreal antibiotics are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of infection. Intravitreal antifungal drugs are also not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of fungal infection. Vitrectomy is not indicated in this case because it would not be effective in treating the vitreous strands and veils.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Increase topical steroids: Topical steroids are the first-line treatment for vitreous strands and veils. They help to reduce inflammation and promote the absorption of the strands.
* B. Inject intravitreal antibiotics: Intravitreal antibiotics are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of infection.
* C. Perform vitrectomy: Vitrectomy is not indicated in this case because it would not be effective in treating the vitreous strands and veils.
* D. Inject antifungal drug: Intravitreal antifungal drugs are also not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of fungal infection.

A lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case because the patient has no signs or symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. A repeat MRI is not indicated because the most recent MRI showed profound cortical atrophy of the parieto-occipital lobes with a slight predilection to the right side compared with the left. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of progressive nonfluent aphasia, which is a type of dementia that is characterized by difficulty with language production and comprehension. Neuropsychological testing is the most appropriate next step in this case because it will help to determine the extent of the patient's cognitive deficits and to identify specific areas of impairment. This information will be helpful in developing a treatment plan for the patient.

Fluorescein angiography is not indicated in this case because it is not a useful test for the diagnosis of progressive nonfluent aphasia. Fluorescein angiography is a procedure that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is used to diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration.

* **A. Lumbar puncture:** A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Lumbar punctures are used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis. However, a lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case because the patient has no signs or symptoms of these conditions.
* **B. Repeat MRI:** An MRI is a type of scan that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. MRIs are often used to diagnose conditions such as cancer, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. However, a repeat MRI is not indicated in this case because the most recent MRI showed profound cortical atrophy of the parieto-occipital lobes with a slight predilection to the right side compared with the left. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of progressive nonfluent aphasia, which is a type of dementia that is characterized by difficulty with language production and comprehension.
* **C. Neuropsychological testing:** Neuropsychological testing is a series of tests that are used to assess cognitive function. Neuropsychological testing can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including dementia, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing is the most appropriate next step in this case because it will help to determine the extent of the patient's cognitive deficits and to identify specific areas of impairment. This information will be helpful in developing a treatment plan for the patient.
* **D. Fluorescein angiography:** Fluorescein angiography is a procedure that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is used to diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. Fluorescein angiography is not indicated in this case because it is not a useful test for the diagnosis of progressive nonfluent aphasia.

 72%|███████▏  | 1103/1525 [4:30:48<1:30:52, 12.92s/it]The correct answer is D. Recommend a surgical intervention that will return his eyes to their original color.

The patient has elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and endothelial cell loss following iris color change. These findings are consistent with pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS), which is a rare condition that can lead to glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. If left untreated, glaucoma can cause blindness.

The patient's IOP is high enough to warrant treatment. The goal of treatment is to lower IOP and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. There are several medications that can be used to lower IOP, including beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to lower IOP.

The patient also has endothelial cell loss. Endothelial cells line the inside of the cornea, which is the clear front part of the eye. Endothelial cells are important for maintaining the cornea's shape and transparency. Endothelial cell loss can lead to corneal edema, which is a swelling of the cornea. Corneal edema can cause blurred vision, glare, and halos.

There is no specific treatment for endothelial cell loss. However, there are several things that can be done to prevent further loss of endothelial cells. These include using artificial tears, avoiding contact lenses, and controlling IOP.

In the patient's case, the best course of treatment is to recommend a surgical intervention that will return his eyes to their original color. This will help to prevent further damage to the optic nerve and cornea.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Observe: This is not an appropriate treatment for a patient with elevated IOP and endothelial cell loss. The patient's IOP needs to be lowered to prevent further damage to the optic nerve.
* B. Adjust topical medications to decrease intraocular pressure and perform visual field testing: This is an appropriate treatment for a patient with elevated IOP. However, it is not the only treatment that is necessary in this case. The patient also needs to have his endothelial cell loss treated.
* C. Recommend increased frequency of ocular surface lubrication and anti-inflammatory medications: This is an appropriate treatment for a patient with endothelial cell loss. However, it is not the only treatment that is necessary in this case. The patient also needs to have his IOP lowered.

 72%|███████▏  | 1104/1525 [4:31:05<1:38:27, 14.03s/it]The correct answer is C. Offer carbamazepine and routine MRI.

The patient has a history of pituitary adenoma resection and external beam radiation. She developed slight ptosis and an adduction deficit of the right eye immediately after the resection, presumed to be secondary to partial oculomotor nerve III (CNIII) damage. Four years earlier, she developed intermittent esotropia of the right eye, presumed secondary to cranial nerve VI palsy. At the present clinic visit, the patient reported the persistence of intermittent diplopia, which had remained unchanged for years, and denied other ocular or systemic complaints.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of oculomotor nerve III palsy with aberrant regeneration. This is a condition in which the oculomotor nerve is damaged, causing ptosis, pupillary dilation, and an adduction deficit. However, the nerve fibers that innervate the eyelid and pupil may regenerate in an abnormal way, causing the eyelid to retract and the pupil to constrict on adduction.

The patient's MRI shows a small amount of residual tumor within the right cavernous sinus. This tumor is likely the cause of the oculomotor nerve III palsy.

The treatment for oculomotor nerve III palsy with aberrant regeneration is typically carbamazepine. Carbamazepine is a medication that can help to control the abnormal nerve impulses that are causing the eyelid retraction and pupil constriction. In addition, the patient should have a routine MRI to monitor the size of the residual tumor. If the tumor grows, the patient may need to undergo additional surgery to remove it.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Topical apraclonidine test is not indicated in this case. Topical apraclonidine is a medication that is used to treat glaucoma. It works by constricting the pupil. However, the patient's pupil is already constricted, so topical apraclonidine would not be helpful in this case.
* Urgent MRI is not necessary in this case. The patient's MRI from 1 year prior showed that the residual tumor is stable. Therefore, an urgent MRI is not necessary to monitor the tumor size.
* Extraocular muscle surgery is not indicated in this case. Extraocular muscle surgery is a procedure that is used to correct misalignment of the eyes. However, the patient's misalignment is intermittent and does not cause significant problems. Therefore, extraocular muscle surgery is not necessary in this case.

 72%|███████▏  | 1105/1525 [4:31:18<1:36:35, 13.80s/it]The correct answer is B. Sweet syndrome.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, acute, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and painful skin lesions. It can be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including infections, malignancy, and medications. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by biopsy, which shows a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis.

The patient in the case presented with fever, painful skin lesions, and a neutrophilic leukocytosis. The skin lesions were described as painful raised circular violaceous papulonecrotic lesions with surrounding erythema and induration. The biopsy showed a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. These findings are consistent with Sweet syndrome.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by painful, ulcerative skin lesions. It is often associated with underlying inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancy, or drug reactions. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by biopsy, which shows a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis and subcutis.

Papillary dermal edema is a benign, self-limited condition that is characterized by edema of the papillary dermis. It is often seen in association with pregnancy, obesity, and certain medications. The diagnosis is made clinically.

Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is a rare, chronic, papulosquamous eruption that is characterized by small, red, scaly papules. It is often associated with human herpesvirus 6 infection. The diagnosis is made clinically.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a clinical picture and laboratory findings that are consistent with Sweet syndrome. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

 73%|███████▎  | 1106/1525 [4:31:35<1:43:18, 14.79s/it]The correct answer is B. Start diuretic, implant cardioverter defibrillator, and evaluate for cardiac transplantation.

The patient is a young woman with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF). She has a history of chest pain and exertional dyspnea, and her exercise capacity has declined. Her electrocardiogram shows a prolonged QT interval, and her transthoracic echocardiogram shows biatrial dilatation and abnormal diastolic filling. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium confirms dilatation of the atria, pulmonary veins, and inferior vena cava.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that can cause heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The patient's history of chest pain and exertional dyspnea suggests that she has heart failure. Her arrhythmias, including AF, increase her risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. The prolonged QT interval increases her risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

The patient's management should focus on treating her heart failure, arrhythmias, and risk factors for sudden cardiac death. Treatment for heart failure includes diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Treatment for arrhythmias includes antiarrhythmic drugs such as flecainide and amiodarone. Treatment for risk factors for sudden cardiac death includes implanting a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

The patient is a young woman with a life-threatening condition. She should be referred to a specialist for further management. The specialist may recommend that she undergo cardiac transplantation. Cardiac transplantation is the surgical replacement of a diseased heart with a healthy heart from a donor. It is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: Start diuretic, β-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. This is a reasonable treatment for heart failure, but it does not address the patient's arrhythmias or risk factors for sudden cardiac death.
* Choice C: Discontinue flecainide, start amiodarone and warfarin. This is a reasonable treatment for arrhythmias, but it does not address the patient's heart failure or risk factors for sudden cardiac death.
* Choice D: Proceed with electrophysiology study and AF ablation. This is a reasonable treatment for AF, but it does not address the patient's heart failure or risk factors for sudden cardiac death.

 73%|███████▎  | 1107/1525 [4:31:52<1:46:27, 15.28s/it]The correct answer is D. Nodular fasciitis.

Proliferative myositis is a rare, benign inflammatory myopathy characterized by proliferation of muscle fibers and inflammatory cells. It is typically seen in young adults, and most cases resolve spontaneously without treatment.

Myositis ossificans is a benign condition characterized by the formation of bone within muscle tissue. It is most commonly seen in young men, and is often associated with trauma.

Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a rare, soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in adults. It is a slow-growing tumor that is often locally aggressive, but rarely metastasizes.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign, self-limiting proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. It is most commonly seen in young adults, and is often associated with trauma. The clinical presentation is typically a painless, rapidly growing mass. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathology. Treatment is typically not required, as the lesion will resolve spontaneously.

In the case presented, the patient is a young woman with a 4-month history of a 2.0-cm mass in her right supraclavicular region. She has no other symptoms. The physical examination reveals a palpable, nontender, freely movable mass in the right supraclavicular region. The CT scan shows a 2.0-cm, right-sided supraclavicular mass just anterior and superior to the right subclavian vein with central patches of hypoattenuation. The ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy shows a benign spindle cell proliferation arranged in a tissue-culture–like pattern with a myxoid to collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the cells to be positive for actin and negative for cytokeratin and S100 protein.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathology, the most likely diagnosis is nodular fasciitis. The other choices are less likely because they do not typically present with a painless, rapidly growing mass. Proliferative myositis is typically associated with pain and inflammation. Myositis ossificans is typically associated with trauma. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a slow-growing tumor that is often locally aggressive.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Nodular fasciitis.

It is characterized by a proliferation of stellate spindled cells in a loose myxoid stroma. The tumor is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. The treatment of choice is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent.

Fibrovascular dysplasia is a non-neoplastic condition that is characterized by the proliferation of fibrous tissue and blood vessels. It can occur in any bone, but it is most common in the mandible. The lesion is usually asymptomatic and is discovered incidentally on imaging. The treatment is not necessary, but surgery may be indicated if the lesion is causing symptoms or disfigurement.

Ameloblastic fibroma is a benign tumor that arises from the enamel organ. It is characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The tumor is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. The treatment of choice is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent.

Giant cell granuloma is a benign tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of giant cells in a loose connective tissue stroma. It can occur in any bone, but it is most common in the mandible. The lesion is usually asymptomatic and is discovered incidentally on imaging. The treatment is not necessary, but surgery may be indicated if the lesion is causing symptoms or disfigurement.

The key features that support the diagnosis of odontogenic myxofibroma in this case include the patient's age (young child), the location of the lesion (maxilla), the imaging findings (expansile mass with erosion of bone), and the histopathologic findings (proliferation of stellate spindled cells in a loose myxoid stroma).

 73%|███████▎  | 1109/1525 [4:32:25<1:50:15, 15.90s/it]The correct answer is C. Tularemia.

Tularemia is a bacterial infection caused by Francisella tularensis. It is typically acquired through contact with infected animals or their tissues, or through the bite of an infected tick. The most common symptoms of tularemia are fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes. In some cases, tularemia can also cause pneumonia, meningitis, or sepsis.

The diagnosis of tularemia is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The most common laboratory test used to diagnose tularemia is a blood culture. However, blood cultures can be negative in up to 50% of cases of tularemia. Other laboratory tests that can be used to diagnose tularemia include serologic testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and lymph node biopsy.

The treatment of tularemia is with antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics for tularemia are ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. In severe cases of tularemia, antibiotics may be given intravenously.

The prognosis of tularemia is generally good with prompt treatment. However, tularemia can be fatal in up to 5% of cases.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Tuberculous lymphadenitis is a condition in which the lymph nodes become infected with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most common symptoms of tuberculous lymphadenitis are fever, chills, night sweats, and enlarged lymph nodes. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. Additionally, the chest radiograph was normal, which is not consistent with tuberculous lymphadenitis.
* Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the lymph nodes. The most common symptoms of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease are fever, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. Additionally, the final pathologic examination showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, which is not consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.
* Cat-scratch disease is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae. The most common symptoms of cat-scratch disease are fever, lymphadenopathy, and a characteristic skin lesion at the site of the cat scratch. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. Additionally, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nodal contents was negative for Bartonella henselae.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. It can affect any organ system, but the lungs are most commonly involved. Other common sites of involvement include the lymph nodes, skin, eyes, heart, liver, and kidneys.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The most common laboratory finding is an elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level. Imaging studies, such as chest radiography or computed tomography (CT) scan, can show characteristic findings of sarcoidosis.

There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but the disease often goes into remission on its own. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include corticosteroids, other medications, and surgery.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of necrotizing granulomas in affected tissues. The diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment is with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.
* Tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial infection that can affect any organ system, but the lungs are most commonly involved. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas in affected tissues. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment is with antibiotics.
* Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in tissues and organs. Amyloid proteins are abnormal proteins that can form insoluble fibrils. The deposition of amyloid proteins can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. The diagnosis of amyloidosis is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment is aimed at reducing the production of amyloid proteins and removing amyloid deposits from tissues and organs.

A papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is composed of both acinar cells and myoepithelial cells. It is a low-grade malignancy with a good prognosis.

A Warthin tumor is a benign mixed tumor of the parotid gland. It is composed of oncocytes and lymphoid stroma.

A mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland carcinoma that is thought to arise from the intercalated duct cells. It is a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis.

The patient in the case presented has a cystic, cribriform, papillary neoplastic growth with low-grade cytologic features and nearly complete myoepithelial rims. Calponin and p63 staining are positive in the myoepithelium surrounding the tumor nests. S-100 is positive within the tumor, and the Ki-67 rate is approximately 5%. Extracellular mucin and occasional mucous cells are also noted. Margins are clear, and there is no evidence of perineural spread or lymphovascular invasion. The patient tolerated the procedure well, recovered appropriately, and was free of complications at his first follow-up appointment.

The features of the tumor in the case presented are most consistent with a diagnosis of low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma. This is a low-grade malignancy with a good prognosis. The patient in the case presented has a good prognosis and is expected to have a long and healthy life.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is composed of both acinar cells and myoepithelial cells. It is a low-grade malignancy with a good prognosis. However, the tumor in the case presented is not composed of acinar cells.

The patient in this case is a 22-year-old woman with no significant medical history who presents with a 2-month history of fevers, shortness of breath, and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. She reports a 2-day history of skin lesions on her ears without trauma. She also reports no recent sick contacts, travel, illicit drug use, or use of oral contraceptive pills or other medications.

The patient's vital signs are significant for a fever of 40.9°C, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The physical examination reveals decreased right basilar breath sounds with dullness to percussion, tachycardia without murmurs or rubs, lower extremity edema, and bilateral cutaneous necrosis of her pinnae.

The laboratory findings are significant for an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated D-dimer level. The chest computed tomography angiogram shows a large right pleural effusion without evidence of pulmonary embolism. Pleural fluid analysis shows an exudative fluid with negative Gram stain and culture.

The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for a systemic inflammatory disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease that can affect any organ system. The skin is one of the most common organs affected in SLE, and cutaneous necrosis is a rare but serious complication.

The diagnosis of SLE is based on a combination of clinical features, laboratory findings, and serologic testing. The most sensitive and specific serologic test for SLE is the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. The ANA test is positive in 95% of patients with SLE. The lupus anticoagulant test is a serologic test that detects the presence of antibodies that interfere with the coagulation cascade. The lupus anticoagulant test is positive in 20% of patients with SLE.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain serum ANA and lupus anticoagulant assays. These tests will help to confirm the diagnosis of SLE and guide further management.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform a skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence is not the next step in the management of this patient. A skin biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of SLE. The ANA and lupus anticoagulant tests are more sensitive and specific than a skin biopsy.
* C. Obtain a bacterial culture of the skin lesions is not the next step in the management of this patient. The patient's skin lesions are not consistent with a bacterial infection. The ANA and lupus anticoagulant tests are more likely to be positive in patients with SLE.
* D. Obtain a urine drug screen is not the next step in the management of this patient. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient is using illicit drugs. The ANA and lupus anticoagulant tests are more likely to be positive in patients with SLE.

The patient has a history of undifferentiated connective tissue disease and long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension. These conditions can lead to right heart failure, which can cause ascites.

The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with right heart failure. She has jugular venous distension, which is a sign of elevated central venous pressure. She also has a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border, which is a sign of tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding in right heart failure.

The Doppler ultrasound findings are also consistent with right heart failure. The ultrasound shows an irregular liver echo pattern without lesions, which is a sign of hepatic congestion. The ultrasound also shows a normal common bile duct, which rules out obstruction of the bile duct. The ultrasound also shows patent portal and hepatic vasculature, which rules out portal hypertension.

The laboratory results are also consistent with right heart failure. The white blood cell count is normal, which rules out infection. The albumin level is low, which is a sign of hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemia is a common finding in right heart failure. The total protein level is also low, which is a sign of hypoproteinemia. Hypoproteinemia can also lead to ascites.

The ascites fluid analysis is also consistent with right heart failure. The fluid is a transudate, which means that it has low protein and high sodium levels. Transudates are common in right heart failure.

The patient's history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and ascites fluid analysis all suggest that her ascites is primarily due to chronically elevated pressures on the right side of her heart.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Her ascites is primarily due to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that can cause ascites. However, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest that she has cirrhosis.

C. Her ascites is primarily due to abdominal malignancy. Abdominal malignancy can cause ascites. However, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest that she has abdominal malignancy.

D. Her ascites is primarily due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a bacterial infection of the ascites fluid. However, the patient's ascites fluid analysis does not suggest that she has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a drug reaction to azathioprine. The rash is a common side effect of azathioprine, and it can be accompanied by fever, arthralgias, and other systemic symptoms. In some cases, the rash can be severe and life-threatening.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Checking angiotensin-converting enzyme level would not be helpful in this case, as this is a test for kidney disease. Commencing corticosteroids would also not be helpful, as corticosteroids can worsen the rash. Performing a punch skin biopsy would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of a drug reaction, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

The best course of action is to stop the azathioprine and monitor the patient closely. If the rash resolves, the patient can be restarted on azathioprine at a lower dose. If the rash does not resolve, or if it worsens, the patient may need to be switched to a different medication.

The patient's family history is significant for prostate cancer in her father and paternal grandfather. These are both cancers that are associated with Lynch syndrome. In addition, the patient's endometrial cancer was found to have microsatellite instability (MSI), which is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome.

However, the patient's tumor was not found to have any mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH1, MSH6, or PMS2). This means that the patient does not have a definitive diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. However, the combination of her family history, MSI, and the lack of mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes is highly suggestive of Lynch syndrome.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Lynch syndrome is suspected. The patient should be referred to a genetic counselor for further evaluation and testing.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Lynch syndrome is confirmed. This is incorrect because the patient's tumor was not found to have any mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes.
* B. Lynch syndrome is suspected. This is the correct answer because the patient's family history, MSI, and the lack of mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes are highly suggestive of Lynch syndrome.
* C. Lynch syndrome is ruled out. This is incorrect because the patient's tumor was found to have MSI, which is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome.

Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is the second stage of syphilis, after the primary stage, which is characterized by a single chancre at the site of infection. Secondary syphilis typically occurs 2-4 weeks after the primary stage, and it can last for 2-6 months.

The characteristic skin lesions of secondary syphilis are called "macular rash". They are small, red or pink spots that are not raised above the skin. The rash can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. The rash is often accompanied by fever, headache, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy.

In some cases, secondary syphilis can also cause lesions in the mouth, throat, eyes, and genitals. These lesions can be painful and can lead to scarring.

The diagnosis of secondary syphilis is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. A blood test can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment for secondary syphilis is a single dose of penicillin G benzathine. This medication is given by injection into a muscle.

The prognosis for secondary syphilis is excellent with treatment. However, if left untreated, secondary syphilis can progress to tertiary syphilis, which is a serious and potentially fatal condition.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Atypical mycobacterium infection is a rare infection that can cause skin lesions. However, the skin lesions of atypical mycobacterium infection are typically different from the skin lesions of secondary syphilis. Atypical mycobacterium infection is also not usually accompanied by fever, headache, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy.
* Cryptococcal infection is a fungal infection that can cause meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain). However, cryptococcal infection is not usually associated with skin lesions. Cryptococcal infection is also not usually accompanied by fever, headache, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy.
* Eruptive keratoacanthomas are a type of skin cancer that can cause rapidly growing, raised lesions on the skin. However, eruptive keratoacanthomas are typically not accompanied by fever, headache, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. Eruptive keratoacanthomas are also not usually found on the palms and soles.

The patient is a middle-aged woman with a history of Crohn disease (CD), which is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. CD is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the bowel wall, and can lead to a variety of complications, including perianal disease.

The patient's symptoms, including a tender perianal plaque with a papular, cobblestone-like surface, are consistent with perianal Crohn disease. The biopsy specimen from the perianal plaque revealed a dermal perivascular and nodular infiltrate composed of aggregates of histiocytes and numerous multinucleate giant cells surrounded by mature lymphocytes. These findings are characteristic of granulomatous inflammation, which is a hallmark of CD.

Fibroepithelial polyps are benign tumors that can occur in the skin, and are not associated with CD. External hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus, and are also not associated with CD. Condyloma acuminata are sexually transmitted lesions that are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).

Gnathostomiasis is caused by the nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum, which is found in the stomach and intestines of cats, dogs, and other animals. The larvae of the nematode can be ingested by humans through contaminated food or water. The larvae migrate to the skin, where they can cause a variety of symptoms, including a serpiginous erythematous plaque, as in the case presented. However, the larvae of Gnathostoma spinigerum are not found in the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen, which makes gnathostomiasis an unlikely diagnosis.

Myiasis is a disease caused by the larvae of flies. The larvae can burrow into the skin, where they can cause a variety of symptoms, including a serpiginous erythematous plaque. However, the larvae of flies are not found in the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen, which makes myiasis an unlikely diagnosis.

Strongyloidiasis is caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, which is found in the soil. The larvae of the nematode can penetrate the skin and migrate to the lungs, where they can cause pneumonia. The larvae can also migrate to the intestines, where they can cause diarrhea. However, the larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis are not found in the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen, which makes strongyloidiasis an unlikely diagnosis.

Cutaneous sparganosis is caused by the tapeworm Spirometra erinaceieuropaei. The larvae of the tapeworm can be ingested by humans through contaminated food or water. The larvae migrate to the skin, where they can cause a variety of symptoms, including a serpiginous erythematous plaque. The larvae of Spirometra erinaceieuropaei are found in the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen, which makes cutaneous sparganosis the most likely diagnosis.

A calcified hydatid cyst is a cyst that is filled with calcium deposits. It is caused by an infection with the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The cyst can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the liver. The symptoms of a calcified hydatid cyst can vary depending on the size and location of the cyst. Some people may experience no symptoms, while others may have abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. Treatment for a calcified hydatid cyst depends on the size and location of the cyst. In some cases, the cyst may be left untreated if it is small and not causing any symptoms. In other cases, the cyst may be removed surgically or drained.

A calcified bowel mass is a mass of tissue in the bowel that has become hardened with calcium deposits. It is most commonly caused by inflammation or infection of the bowel. The symptoms of a calcified bowel mass can vary depending on the size and location of the mass. Some people may experience no symptoms, while others may have abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. Treatment for a calcified bowel mass depends on the size and location of the mass. In some cases, the mass may be left untreated if it is small and not causing any symptoms. In other cases, the mass may be removed surgically.

A swallowed foreign body is an object that has been swallowed and become lodged in the digestive tract. The most common swallowed foreign bodies are coins, pins, and buttons. The symptoms of a swallowed foreign body can vary depending on the size and location of the object. Some people may experience no symptoms, while others may have abdominal pain, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing. Treatment for a swallowed foreign body depends on the size and location of the object. In some cases, the object may pass through the digestive tract on its own. In other cases, the object may need to be removed surgically.

In the case of the 57-year-old woman, the most likely diagnosis is a gallstone. This is because she has a history of gallstones and the abdominal X-ray shows a rounded radio-opaque lesion in the right side of the mid to lower quadrant, at the level of L5 vertebral body. This lesion is consistent with a gallstone. The other choices are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on the abdominal X-ray.

 73%|███████▎  | 1120/1525 [4:34:58<1:37:26, 14.43s/it]The correct answer is C. Secondary splenic cyst.

A. Echinococcal disease is caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The tapeworm larvae encyst in the liver, lungs, and other organs, including the spleen. The cysts are filled with fluid and may contain daughter cysts. Echinococcal disease is most common in areas where sheep and cattle are raised, such as the Mediterranean region, Middle East, Central Asia, and South America. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for echinococcal disease, and the CT scan did not show any evidence of daughter cysts. Therefore, echinococcal disease is not the most likely diagnosis.

B. Congenital splenic cyst is a rare type of cyst that is present at birth. The cysts are usually small and asymptomatic. However, they can grow larger and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. Congenital splenic cysts are not associated with any other medical conditions. The patient in this case did not have any history of abdominal trauma, infection, or surgery. Therefore, congenital splenic cyst is not the most likely diagnosis.

D. Splenic abscess is a collection of pus in the spleen. It is usually caused by bacterial infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. Splenic abscess can also be caused by fungal infection or tuberculosis. The patient in this case did not have any history of abdominal trauma, infection, or surgery. The CT scan did not show any evidence of infection. Therefore, splenic abscess is not the most likely diagnosis.

The patient in this case has a large, well-defined, cystic mass with mural calcification in the spleen. The cyst was not enhanced in the arterial phase, which suggests that it is not a neoplasm. The laboratory test results showed a mild increase in the carbohydrate antigen 72-4 level, which is a marker of inflammation. The patient also had mild tenderness over the posterior left upper quadrant. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of secondary splenic cyst. Secondary splenic cysts are caused by inflammation or infection of the spleen. They are usually small and asymptomatic, but they can grow larger and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. Treatment for secondary splenic cysts usually involves surgical removal of the cyst.

 74%|███████▎  | 1121/1525 [4:35:15<1:41:36, 15.09s/it]The correct answer is B. Test for antiretinal antibodies.

The patient in the case has sudden, painless bilateral vision loss that developed over a period of 2 weeks. She also has a history of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of autoimmune optic neuritis (AON). AON is an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve that is caused by antibodies attacking the optic nerve.

The gold standard for diagnosing AON is testing for antiretinal antibodies. These antibodies are found in the blood of about 70% of patients with AON. Testing for antiretinal antibodies is important because it can help to confirm the diagnosis of AON and to rule out other possible causes of vision loss, such as multiple sclerosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with gadolinium is not necessary to diagnose AON. MRI can be used to rule out other possible causes of vision loss, such as multiple sclerosis, but it is not necessary for diagnosing AON.
* Syphilis and tuberculosis testing are not necessary to diagnose AON. Syphilis and tuberculosis are both infections that can cause optic neuritis, but they are not common causes of AON.
* Obtaining erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level is not necessary to diagnose AON. ESR and CRP are inflammatory markers that can be used to monitor the activity of an inflammatory condition, but they are not necessary to diagnose AON.

 74%|███████▎  | 1122/1525 [4:35:27<1:36:05, 14.31s/it]The correct answer is C. Start oral prednisone therapy.

The patient is a healthy woman in her 20s who presented with painless loss of vision in her right eye for 2 weeks. Her visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/20 OS. The right eye was temporally hyperemic and mildly tender to touch. Fundus examination revealed an elevated whitish lesion in the superotemporal quadrant of the right eye, associated with subretinal fluid at the fovea. A- and B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated a choroidal mass with moderate internal reflectivity.

The most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory choroidal mass, such as a choroidal granuloma or choroidal hemangioma. These lesions can cause visual loss due to compression of the optic nerve or fovea, or due to inflammation of the retina.

The initial treatment for an inflammatory choroidal mass is oral prednisone therapy. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that has anti-inflammatory properties. It is typically given at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a gradual taper over 4-8 weeks.

If the patient does not respond to oral prednisone therapy, or if the lesion is large or progressive, then other treatment options may be considered, such as laser therapy, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit is not the correct answer because the patient has already had an A- and B-scan ultrasonography, which is a more sensitive test for choroidal masses.
* B. Refer to oncology for metastatic workups is not the correct answer because the patient is a healthy young woman with no history of cancer. The most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory choroidal mass, not a metastatic tumor.
* D. Schedule transscleral or transvitreal biopsy is not the correct answer because the patient has already been diagnosed with an inflammatory choroidal mass. A biopsy is not necessary in this case.

 74%|███████▎  | 1123/1525 [4:35:43<1:39:37, 14.87s/it]The correct answer is D: Refer the patient back to her oncologist. The patient has a history of non–small cell lung cancer treated with wedge resection 2 years prior, and she had been receiving chemotherapy until 1 year previously. She was declared free of cancer 6 months earlier based on systemic surveillance. However, she is now presenting with blurred vision in the right eye for 1 week. Her visual acuity is 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures are 19 mm Hg OU. Biomicroscopy showed trace anterior chamber cells in the right eye with mild vitritis. Fundus examination demonstrated parafoveal whitening with hemorrhage and focal aggregations. The lesion stained on fluorescein angiography. There was no evidence of disc edema or vasculitis. Optical coherence tomography showed disorganization of the retina.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes viral retinitis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and rickettsial infection. However, the most likely diagnosis is retinal metastasis from her underlying lung cancer. This is supported by her history of lung cancer, the presence of vitritis, and the lack of response to empirical antimicrobial therapy.

The next step in management is to refer the patient back to her oncologist for further evaluation and treatment. The oncologist will likely order additional testing, such as a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the oncologist will develop a treatment plan that may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Broadening empirical antimicrobial coverage is not necessary in this patient because the most likely diagnosis is retinal metastasis from her underlying lung cancer. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is only indicated in patients with a suspected infectious etiology of their retinal whitening.
* Performing a vitrectomy with vitreous polymerase chain reaction is not necessary in this patient because the most likely diagnosis is retinal metastasis from her underlying lung cancer. Vitrectomy and vitreous PCR are only indicated in patients with a suspected infectious etiology of their retinal whitening.
* Obtaining a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion is not necessary in this patient because the most likely diagnosis is retinal metastasis from her underlying lung cancer. Chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy is only indicated in patients with a suspected non-infectious etiology of their retinal whitening.

 74%|███████▎  | 1124/1525 [4:35:59<1:40:06, 14.98s/it]The correct answer is C. Embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy. The patient in the case has a homogeneously enhancing, well-demarcated, ovoid mass within the medial intraconal space, measuring 2.0 × 2.2 × 2.6 cm. The lesion displaced the globe inferiorly and anteriorly. Smooth bony remodeling was present without erosive changes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits corroborated these findings. Conventional angiography demonstrated a tortuous branch of the left ophthalmic artery supplying the medial aspect of the orbital mass.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma, which is a benign vascular tumor. Cavernous hemangiomas are typically well-circumscribed and slow-growing. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head and neck region.

The treatment of cavernous hemangiomas is typically surgical excision. However, in some cases, embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy may be a better option. Embolization is a procedure in which small particles are injected into the blood vessel that supplies the tumor. This can help to reduce the blood flow to the tumor and make it easier to remove during surgery.

Orbitotomy is a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the eyelid to access the orbit. This allows the surgeon to remove the tumor. Biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope. This helps to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the mass.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the tumor and a small sample of tissue is removed. This procedure is not typically used to diagnose cavernous hemangiomas because it can be difficult to obtain a representative sample of the tumor.
* Fluorescein angiography is a procedure in which a dye is injected into the bloodstream and then images of the blood vessels are taken. This procedure can be used to diagnose cavernous hemangiomas, but it is not typically used to treat them.
* Observation is not a treatment option for cavernous hemangiomas. Cavernous hemangiomas are typically slow-growing, but they can grow larger and cause problems over time. Therefore, it is important to treat them promptly.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells. This buildup of cells causes thick, red, scaly patches of skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.

The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Psoriasis is not contagious.

There is no cure for psoriasis, but there are treatments that can help control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical medications, light therapy, and oral medications.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, noncancerous disorder that affects the cells of the immune system. The symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis can vary depending on the part of the body that is affected. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, such as fever, bone pain, or lymphadenopathy.

Congenital syphilis is a serious, potentially fatal infection that can be transmitted to a fetus from an infected mother. The symptoms of congenital syphilis can vary depending on the stage of the infection. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of congenital syphilis, such as a rash, fever, or swollen lymph nodes.

Pityriasis lichenoides is a chronic skin condition that causes small, scaly patches on the skin. The patches of pityriasis lichenoides are often found on the trunk, arms, and legs. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of pityriasis lichenoides, such as the small, scaly patches.

 74%|███████▍  | 1126/1525 [4:36:31<1:44:31, 15.72s/it]The correct answer is myocardial restriction. The patient has a history of mantle chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, which can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle is stiff and cannot relax properly. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy, and her hemodynamic data show a restrictive pattern.

Tamponade is a condition in which there is a buildup of fluid in the pericardial sac, which surrounds the heart. This can cause the heart to be compressed and can lead to a number of symptoms, including dyspnea, chest pain, and hypotension. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with tamponade, and her hemodynamic data do not show a tamponade pattern.

Right ventricular failure is a condition in which the right ventricle cannot pump blood effectively. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and jugular venous distention. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with right ventricular failure, but her hemodynamic data do not show a right ventricular failure pattern.

Wide-open tricuspid regurgitation is a condition in which the tricuspid valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back from the right ventricle to the right atrium. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and jugular venous distention. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with wide-open tricuspid regurgitation, and her hemodynamic data do not show a wide-open tricuspid regurgitation pattern.

In conclusion, the correct answer is myocardial restriction. The patient's history, physical examination, and hemodynamic data are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. The buildup of amyloid can damage organs and tissues, leading to serious health problems.

There are several different types of amyloidosis, each caused by a different type of abnormal protein. The most common type of amyloidosis is AL amyloidosis, which is caused by a build-up of abnormal light chains (a type of protein) produced by plasma cells.

Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of benign (noncancerous) tumor that can grow in the salivary glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor.

Paraganglioma is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can grow in the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are located throughout the body.

Schwannoma is a type of benign (noncancerous) tumor that grows from Schwann cells, which are cells that support nerve fibers.

In the case presented, the patient is an elderly man with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead. He presents with a 6-month history of a slowly enlarging left facial mass. He does not have facial pain, weakness, numbness, trismus, or difficulty chewing. He has no history of dysphagia and/or odynophagia, hoarseness, vision changes, dry mouth, decreased ipsilateral sweating, weight loss, fevers, chills, or a history of tobacco or alcohol use.

Physical examination reveals a palpable nontender mass in the left parapharyngeal space. Cervical lymphadenopathy is not palpable. Nasopharyngoscopy reveals slight bulging of the lateral pharyngeal wall into the oropharynx with no discrete masses seen. Computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies were nondiagnostic. Axial T2-weighted MRI showed a lesion arising from the left parapharyngeal space, arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland. The lesion caused loss of the fat plane between the parapharyngeal space and masticator space with subsequent inflammation of the pterygoid space. The pharyngeal mucosa of the left lateral pharyngeal wall was effaced owing to mass effect.

The mass was surgically resected in its entirety. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed sections of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign-body giant cell reaction and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Sheets of plasma cells were positive for κ and CD138 and negative for λ, consistent with clonal κ light-chain restricted plasma cell infiltrates around amorphous tissue. Congo red stain showed apple-green birefringence demonstrated on polarized microscopy.

The findings on MRI, histopathology, and Congo red staining are all consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead is also a risk factor for amyloidosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of benign (noncancerous) tumor that can grow in the salivary glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor. The findings on MRI, histopathology, and Congo red staining are not consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma.

Paraganglioma is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can grow in the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are located throughout the body. The findings on MRI, histopathology, and Congo red staining are not consistent with a diagnosis of paraganglioma.

Schwannoma is a type of benign (noncancerous) tumor that grows from Schwann cells, which are cells that support nerve fibers. The findings on MRI, histopathology, and Congo red staining are not consistent with a diagnosis of schwannoma.

The patient has a history of AML, which is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. AML can spread to other parts of the body, including the larynx. The patient's symptoms of hoarseness, throat pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia are consistent with a laryngeal mass. The CT scan shows a right-sided laryngeal mass, which is also consistent with a laryngeal mass. The histopathologic analysis shows a mixed infiltrate containing numerous mononuclear myeloid cells positive for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD68, and CD33 but negative for CD117. This is consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma.

The other choices are incorrect. Laryngeal lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymph nodes. Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a type of cancer that starts in the plasma cells, which are cells that produce antibodies.

A pleomorphic adenoma is a benign mixed tumor of salivary glands that is composed of epithelial and mesenchymal elements. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor, accounting for approximately 75% of all cases. Pleomorphic adenomas typically present as a slow-growing, painless mass in the parotid gland. They are usually well-circumscribed and have a smooth, lobulated surface. On histopathologic examination, pleomorphic adenomas are composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal elements, including ductal cells, myoepithelial cells, and mesenchymal cells. The epithelial cells may form glands, ducts, or cysts. The mesenchymal cells may form a variety of structures, including smooth muscle, cartilage, and bone. Pleomorphic adenomas are usually treated with surgical excision.

A dermoid cyst is a benign tumor that is composed of skin and its appendages, such as hair, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. It is usually found in the head and neck region, but it can occur anywhere in the body. Dermoid cysts are typically small, round, and well-circumscribed. They are usually filled with a cheesy or oily material. On histopathologic examination, dermoid cysts are composed of skin and its appendages. The skin may be normal or it may be thickened and hyperkeratotic. The appendages may be present in normal or abnormal amounts. Dermoid cysts are usually treated with surgical excision.

A pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that is usually found on the skin or mucous membranes. It is typically a small, red, raised lesion that bleeds easily. Pyogenic granulomas are usually caused by trauma or irritation. They are usually treated with surgical excision or laser therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 30s who presented with a lump on her tongue that had been progressively enlarging for several years without a precipitating event or symptoms. The size now caused intermittent gagging and a foreign-body sensation in her throat. She denied pain and was an otherwise healthy nonsmoker. Examination of the oral cavity revealed an approximately 1-cm, pedunculated mass of the posterior dorsal tongue just lateral to the circumvallate papillae. The lesion was mobile and well-circumscribed without ulceration or surrounding mucosal abnormalities. It was nontender to palpation without drainage or discharge. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy showed no other lesions. Neck ultrasonography showed a normal thyroid gland. Excisional biopsy was performed with the patient under local anesthesia, and the entire lesion was sent for pathologic examination. Grossly, the firm, polypoid mass measured 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 cm. Histopathologic examination revealed a discrete proliferation of mature bone with overlying mildly hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium without surrounding inflammation. The core was composed of dense lamellar osseous matrix with numerous Haversian canals and associated regularly dispersed osteocytes in lacunae.

The histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of osseous choristoma. An osseous choristoma is a benign tumor that is composed of mature bone that is found in an abnormal location, such as the tongue. Osseous choristomas are usually asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging studies or during surgery. They are usually treated with surgical excision.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pleomorphic adenoma: Pleomorphic adenomas are typically found in the parotid gland and are not associated with bone formation.

Additionally, the CT scan and MRI findings are not consistent with a Thornwaldt cyst.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the nasopharynx, which is located at the back of the nose. It is the most common type of cancer in the nasopharynx, but it is still a rare cancer. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, such as a persistent sore throat, ear pain, or facial paralysis. Additionally, the CT scan and MRI findings are not consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Meningocele is a type of birth defect that occurs when the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, bulge out through a defect in the skull or spine. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of a meningocele, such as a backache, leg weakness, or numbness. Additionally, the CT scan and MRI findings are not consistent with a meningocele.

Extraosseous chordoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the notochord, which is a structure that forms in the embryo and eventually develops into the spine.

The dipstick urine analysis showed a positive result for blood, but this does not confirm the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine. Microscopic urinalysis is the gold standard test for detecting RBCs in the urine. It can also identify the type of RBCs (e.g., glomerular or nonglomerular) and the number of RBCs per high-power field (HPF). This information is important for determining the cause of hematuria.

A computed tomographic scan (CT scan) is not necessary to evaluate hematuria in the absence of other symptoms or signs. A CT scan can be used to identify the source of hematuria, but it is not as sensitive as microscopic urinalysis for detecting RBCs in the urine.

A cystoscopy is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube with a camera into the bladder to look for abnormalities. Cystoscopy is not necessary to evaluate hematuria in the absence of other symptoms or signs. It is typically reserved for patients with persistent or recurrent hematuria or those with other symptoms or signs that suggest a urological abnormality.

Urine cytology is a test to look for cancer cells in the urine. It is not necessary to evaluate hematuria in the absence of other symptoms or signs.

This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and other congenital anomalies. The skin lesions are typically present at birth and are characterized by irregular, dark brown, well-demarcated macules with regular pigment networks on dermoscopy within prominent soft, yellow, papular protrusions in a Blaschkolinear arrangement. The lesions can be localized or widespread, and they may be associated with inflammation, scarring, and ulceration. Skeletal abnormalities can include syndactyly (fusion of fingers or toes), ectrodactyly (absence of fingers or toes), and limb hypoplasia. Other congenital anomalies can include cleft lip or palate, heart defects, and urogenital abnormalities.

The diagnosis of focal dermal hypoplasia is based on the clinical findings and confirmed by genetic testing. There is no cure for focal dermal hypoplasia, but treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. This may include surgery to correct the skeletal abnormalities, skin grafts to cover the lesions, and treatment of any associated infections or complications.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation is a rare genetic disorder characterized by blisters and scarring of the skin. The blisters are caused by a defect in the proteins that hold the skin cells together. The blisters can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the hands, feet, and elbows. The scarring can be severe and can lead to contractures (tightness of the skin). Epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation is not associated with the skeletal abnormalities or other congenital anomalies seen in focal dermal hypoplasia.
* Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive pattern of skin lesions that develop in a Blaschkolinear arrangement. The lesions are initially vesicular (blister-like) and then become verrucous (wart-like). They eventually fade and leave behind atrophic (thin) skin with areas of hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin) and hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin). Incontinentia pigmenti is not associated with the skeletal abnormalities or other congenital anomalies seen in focal dermal hypoplasia.
* Nevus lipomatosus superficialis is a rare benign (noncancerous) skin condition characterized by a raised, smooth, yellow or orange papule (small bump) that is often surrounded by a halo of hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin).

 74%|███████▍  | 1133/1525 [4:38:18<1:39:13, 15.19s/it]The correct diagnosis is incontinentia pigmenti (IP), a rare X-linked dominant disorder that affects the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, and central nervous system. It is characterized by the development of linear streaks of blisters, which later become hyperpigmented patches. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. There is no cure for IP, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Congenital herpes zoster is a viral infection that can cause blisters in a linear arrangement. However, the blisters in congenital herpes zoster are usually more widespread than the blisters in IP, and they often develop within the first 24 hours of life. In addition, congenital herpes zoster can be associated with other symptoms, such as fever, irritability, and seizures.
* Neonatal pustular melanosis is a benign skin condition that occurs in newborns. It is characterized by the development of small pustules on the skin, which later become hyperpigmented patches. The pustules in neonatal pustular melanosis usually resolve within a few weeks.
* Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the development of linear streaks of hyperpigmentation. The lesions in linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis are usually present at birth or appear within the first few months of life. They do not usually resolve, but they may fade over time.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is incontinentia pigmenti. The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the reasons described above.

 74%|███████▍  | 1134/1525 [4:38:34<1:41:00, 15.50s/it]The correct answer is C. Xanthoma disseminatum.

Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by thick, dark, velvety skin in areas such as the armpits, neck, groin, and under the breasts. It is usually caused by an underlying medical condition, such as obesity, diabetes, or certain types of cancer.

Eruptive xanthomas are small, yellow, raised bumps that can appear on the skin, particularly on the buttocks, elbows, knees, and hands. They are caused by a buildup of cholesterol in the blood, and are often associated with high cholesterol levels, diabetes, or pancreatitis.

Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare skin condition characterized by the appearance of multiple small, yellow, raised bumps on the skin. It is caused by a buildup of cholesterol in the blood, and is often associated with certain types of cancer, such as Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia.

Axillary granular parakeratosis is a harmless skin condition characterized by the appearance of small, white bumps on the skin of the armpits. It is caused by a build-up of dead skin cells in the hair follicles, and is usually not associated with any underlying medical conditions.

In the case of the 55-year-old man, the most likely diagnosis is xanthoma disseminatum. This is because the patient has multiple small, yellow, raised bumps on the skin, which are associated with a buildup of cholesterol in the blood. The patient also has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for xanthoma disseminatum. The patient's laboratory data also revealed mildly elevated triglycerides, which is another risk factor for xanthoma disseminatum.

Acanthosis nigricans is less likely because the patient does not have any of the associated medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, or cancer. Eruptive xanthomas are also less likely because the patient does not have any of the associated risk factors, such as high cholesterol levels, diabetes, or pancreatitis. Axillary granular parakeratosis is the least likely diagnosis because the patient has multiple small, yellow, raised bumps on the skin, which is not characteristic of this condition.

A mucocele is a benign, cystic lesion that is filled with mucus. It can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the sinuses and the nasopharynx. Mucoceles are caused by a blockage of a mucus gland, which can lead to the accumulation of mucus and the formation of a cyst.

The symptoms of a mucocele can vary depending on its size and location. In the case of a mucocele of the nasopharynx, the patient may experience a headache, facial pain, and swelling of the face. The patient may also experience nasal congestion, discharge, and hearing loss.

The diagnosis of a mucocele is made based on a physical examination and imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI. Treatment of a mucocele depends on its size and location. Small mucoceles may resolve on their own, but larger mucoceles may require surgery to remove the cyst.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A cluster headache is a type of headache that is characterized by severe, one-sided pain that occurs in attacks that last for 15 to 180 minutes. Cluster headaches are often accompanied by other symptoms, such as tearing, redness of the eye, and nasal congestion. The patient in this case does not have the typical symptoms of a cluster headache.
* Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare disorder that is characterized by inflammation of the nerves that control eye movement. It can cause severe pain in the face and eyes, as well as other symptoms, such as double vision and drooping eyelid. The patient in this case does not have the typical symptoms of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.
* An acute episode of angle-closure glaucoma is a type of glaucoma that is caused by a sudden blockage of the drainage system in the eye. It can cause severe pain, blurred vision, and nausea. The patient in this case does not have the typical symptoms of an acute episode of angle-closure glaucoma.

 74%|███████▍  | 1136/1525 [4:39:03<1:35:28, 14.73s/it]The correct answer is B. Bilateral femoral hernia.

A right inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents through a weak spot in the abdominal wall in the groin area. It is more common in men than in women. The most common symptom is a bulge in the groin area. Other symptoms may include pain, discomfort, and a feeling of fullness in the groin area.

Diabetic neuropathy is a condition that affects the nerves, especially the nerves in the hands and feet. It can cause numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness in the hands and feet.

Vascular occlusive disease is a condition that occurs when the arteries that carry blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This can cause pain, cramping, and numbness in the legs.

The patient in the case presented with a pain in the right groin that had worsened since its onset 3 days before. The pain radiated throughout the right leg and was related to nausea without vomiting. The patient’s history revealed chronic constipation, relieved by the use of laxatives. The patient never noticed any inguinal protrusion or mass. Furthermore, results of an abdominal physical examination were also normal, and no neurological or vascular deficits were found.

The abdominal computed tomographic scans performed in the emergency department showed bilateral femoral hernias. Femoral hernias are the most common type of hernia in women. They occur when abdominal contents, such as intestines or fat, push through a weak spot in the lower abdominal wall near the groin. Femoral hernias are more likely to occur in people who are overweight or obese, have a history of constipation, or have a weakened abdominal wall.

The patient's symptoms and the findings on the abdominal computed tomographic scans are consistent with a diagnosis of bilateral femoral hernias. The other answer choices are not supported by the patient's history, physical examination, or diagnostic tests.

 75%|███████▍  | 1137/1525 [4:39:19<1:39:08, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is D. Annular pancreas.

Annular pancreas is a rare congenital anomaly in which a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the second part of the duodenum. It is thought to occur when the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fail to fuse properly during embryogenesis.

The most common presentation of annular pancreas is gastric outlet obstruction, which is caused by the narrowing of the duodenum. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

Diagnosis is made with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which can visualize the ring of pancreatic tissue. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen may also be helpful in making the diagnosis.

Treatment of annular pancreas is surgical. The goal of surgery is to relieve the gastric outlet obstruction by excising the ring of pancreatic tissue.

Fibrosis owing to chronic peptic ulceration is a possible cause of gastric outlet obstruction, but it is not the most likely cause in this case. The patient's history of a 6-month history of a dull, epigastric pain, 10-kg weight loss (from 52 kg to 42 kg), and a 6- to 8-week history of nausea and vomiting is more consistent with annular pancreas.

Duodenal carcinoma is a possible cause of gastric outlet obstruction, but it is not the most likely cause in this case. The patient's history is not consistent with duodenal carcinoma.

Duodenal web is a rare congenital anomaly that can cause gastric outlet obstruction. However, it is not the most likely cause in this case. The patient's history is not consistent with duodenal web.

 75%|███████▍  | 1138/1525 [4:39:29<1:27:10, 13.51s/it]The correct answer is B. Initiate treatment with oral valacyclovir.

The patient in this case has an atypical ulcerated lesion at the eyelid margin. The clinical examination and biopsy findings are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including cold sores, genital herpes, and shingles. The most common treatment for HSV infection is oral antiviral medication, such as valacyclovir. Valacyclovir works by inhibiting the replication of the HSV virus, which helps to reduce the severity of the infection and shorten the healing time.

Other treatment options for HSV infection include topical antiviral medication, such as acyclovir cream, and cryotherapy. Topical antiviral medication is less effective than oral antiviral medication, but it may be a good option for patients with mild infections. Cryotherapy is a procedure that uses a cold probe to freeze the infected skin. This procedure is often used to treat small, localized HSV infections.

Mohs micrographic surgery is a specialized surgical procedure that is used to remove skin cancer. This procedure is not typically used to treat HSV infection. Reconstruction with flap is a surgical procedure that is used to repair a defect in the skin. This procedure is not typically used to treat HSV infection.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Initiate treatment with oral valacyclovir. The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most effective treatment for HSV infection.

 75%|███████▍  | 1139/1525 [4:39:43<1:28:53, 13.82s/it]The correct answer is B. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and lymphocyte analysis.

The patient presents with a periocular rash in a healthy teenager. The rash is painful and vesicular, and it is located in the V1 distribution. The patient also has a heart murmur and no known history of chickenpox. His pediatrician prescribed oral acyclovir and ibuprofen as needed for pain.

The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO is a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. It is characterized by a unilateral vesicular rash in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. HZO can be complicated by keratitis, uveitis, and secondary bacterial infections.

The most important initial management of HZO is to start antiviral therapy as soon as possible. Acyclovir is the first-line treatment for HZO. It should be started within 72 hours of the onset of the rash to reduce the risk of complications.

In addition to antiviral therapy, patients with HZO should be evaluated for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV infection is a risk factor for HZO, and patients with HIV are more likely to have severe disease. HIV testing should be offered to all patients with HZO, regardless of their risk factors.

Lymphocyte analysis is also important in the management of HZO. Patients with HZO often have a lymphopenia, which can increase the risk of complications. Lymphocyte analysis can help to assess the severity of the disease and to monitor the response to treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Obtain a corneal culture is not necessary in this patient. The diagnosis of HZO is clinical, and a corneal culture is not likely to be helpful.
* C. Discontinue oral acyclovir and start topical trifluridine is not the correct management for this patient. Oral acyclovir is the first-line treatment for HZO, and it should not be discontinued unless there is a serious adverse reaction. Topical trifluridine is an alternative treatment for HZO, but it is not as effective as oral acyclovir.
* D. Perform corneal topography is not necessary in this patient. The diagnosis of HZO is clinical, and corneal topography is not likely to be helpful.

 75%|███████▍  | 1140/1525 [4:40:00<1:34:33, 14.74s/it]The correct answer is D: Check serology results for exposure to infectious agents.

The patient has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with a CD4 count of 25, which puts him at high risk for opportunistic infections. The retinal lesions in the right eye are atypical for CMV retinitis, which is the most common cause of infectious retinitis in HIV-infected patients. The lesions are not well-defined and do not have the typical "brushfire" appearance of CMV retinitis. Additionally, the patient has no history of CMV retinitis in the right eye.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's retinal lesions includes other infectious causes of retinitis, such as toxoplasmosis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus. It is also important to consider non-infectious causes of retinitis, such as autoimmune diseases, vasculitis, and malignancy.

The first step in the evaluation of the patient's retinal lesions is to obtain serology results for exposure to infectious agents. This will help to determine the possible causes of the patient's retinitis and guide the selection of further diagnostic tests. If the serology results are negative for the common infectious causes of retinitis, then non-infectious causes should be considered.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Adding steroids is not indicated in the treatment of infectious retinitis. Steroids can worsen the infection and increase the risk of complications.
* Option B: Obtaining aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction/culture/cytology is a useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of infectious retinitis. However, this test is not necessary in the patient's case because the differential diagnosis is already narrow.
* Option C: Injecting intravitreous voriconazole is a treatment option for CMV retinitis. However, this treatment is not indicated in the patient's case because CMV retinitis is not the most likely cause of his retinal lesions.

 75%|███████▍  | 1141/1525 [4:40:11<1:26:43, 13.55s/it]The correct answer is "Perform incisional biopsy of the left lacrimal gland."

The patient presented with decreased vision in the left eye that was associated with intermittent left orbital pain progressing from a dull ache to throbbing pain over 2 days. Findings from the examination were remarkable for reduced visual acuity in the left eye (20/80), proptosis with hypoglobus in the left eye, S-shaped left blepharoptosis, and left retinochoroidal folds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast demonstrated a well-defined superotemporal mass with homogeneous enhancement. The patient was admitted for a trial of intravenous methylprednisolone, 1000 mg, for presumed inflammatory dacryoadenitis. Results of a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody, Lyme titer and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, chest radiograph, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, urinalysis, and IgG4 index were normal. The patient’s pain nearly resolved after 3 days of intravenous methylprednisolone treatment, and he was discharged with a regimen of 80 mg/d of oral prednisone.

When the patient was reevaluated 2 weeks later, the pain at rest had resolved, but pain on palpation of the superotemporal left orbit persisted. Results of the examination were otherwise unchanged. Results of additional MRI of the orbits with contrast were unchanged.

The most likely diagnosis is adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland (LGACC). LGACC is a rare, slow-growing malignancy that typically affects adults in their 50s or 60s. It is the most common type of epithelial malignancy of the lacrimal gland. LGACC typically presents with a painless mass in the upper eyelid. The mass may be associated with proptosis, diplopia, and decreased vision. LGACC is often diagnosed on imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. The gold standard for diagnosis is biopsy. Treatment for LGACC typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with LGACC is variable, but most patients with localized disease have a good prognosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A gallium scan is a nuclear medicine test that is used to detect inflammation. It is not indicated in the diagnosis of LGACC.
* Antiviral therapy with acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus infection. It is not indicated in the diagnosis or treatment of LGACC.
* Increasing the dosage of oral prednisone may be helpful in treating the symptoms of LGACC, such as pain and swelling. However, it is not a definitive treatment for LGACC.

In conclusion, the correct answer is "Perform incisional biopsy of the left lacrimal gland." This is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

Coxsackievirus A6–associated exanthem is a viral infection that causes a rash, fever, and sometimes sore throat. The rash is typically a red, bumpy rash that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities. It usually resolves on its own within a week.

Phototoxic dermatitis (phytophoto) is a skin reaction that occurs when the skin is exposed to both sunlight and certain chemicals. The chemicals can be found in plants, such as poison ivy, oak, and sumac. The rash is typically a red, itchy rash that appears on the areas of the skin that were exposed to the sun. It usually resolves within a few weeks.

Nickel contact dermatitis is a skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with nickel. Nickel is a metal that is found in many everyday objects, such as jewelry, coins, and zippers. The rash is typically a red, itchy rash that appears on the areas of the skin that were exposed to nickel. It usually resolves within a few weeks.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of mild atopic dermatitis, which is a skin condition that makes the skin more susceptible to allergies. She also has a history of contact with poison ivy. The rash on her arms, neck, axillae, and face is consistent with black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The black streaks on her right arm are also consistent with black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history, physical examination findings, or rash.

 75%|███████▍  | 1143/1525 [4:40:41<1:32:39, 14.55s/it]The correct answer is D. FFR with adenosine should be remeasured after placing a stent in the distal lesion to better assess the proximal lesion.

The proximal lesion is not ischemic, as evidenced by the FFR value of 0.82. This means that the proximal lesion is not causing any significant flow limitation. The distal lesion, on the other hand, is ischemic, as evidenced by the FFR value of 0.43. This means that the distal lesion is causing significant flow limitation.

The current recommendation is to treat only the ischemic lesion(s) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the distal lesion should be stented. However, it is important to note that the FFR value of the proximal lesion may change after stenting the distal lesion. This is because the distal lesion may no longer be the only ischemic lesion. In other words, the proximal lesion may become ischemic after stenting the distal lesion.

To avoid this, it is recommended to remeasure FFR with adenosine after placing a stent in the distal lesion. This will allow the physician to assess the proximal lesion and determine if it is also ischemic. If the proximal lesion is also ischemic, it can then be stented.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A is incorrect because the proximal lesion is not ischemic.
* Choice B is incorrect because the distal lesion is ischemic and should be stented.
* Choice C is incorrect because both lesions are not necessarily ischemic. The proximal lesion may only become ischemic after stenting the distal lesion.

 75%|███████▌  | 1144/1525 [4:40:50<1:22:00, 12.92s/it]The correct diagnosis is osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor. The patient's history of bilateral retinoblastoma and advanced malignant small blue cell tumor, which was interpreted as an olfactory neuroblastoma and treated with radiation and chemotherapy, is consistent with a predisposition to developing osteosarcoma. The patient's presentation with a hard, fixed, rounded 2-cm lesion in the right supraorbital region is also consistent with osteosarcoma. The CT scan showed an irregular mass in the right frontal, maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses with surrounding sclerotic and erosive bony changes. These findings are also consistent with osteosarcoma. The FNA revealed atypical, mitotically active cells, which is a suggestive finding for osteosarcoma. The bone shavings obtained operatively were interpreted as chronic sinusitis with sclerotic bone. However, the surgical specimen showed multinucleated giant cells and bizarre stromal cells suggestive of treatment effect and normal-appearing bone. This finding is not consistent with a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis, as the presence of multinucleated giant cells and bizarre stromal cells is more suggestive of a neoplastic process. The second opinion was reported as chronic sinusitis and atypical stromal cells. However, the patient returned 2 months later with increasing pain, endoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion occupying the biopsied site. On repeated operative biopsy, histologic examination showed similar giant cells and atypical stromal cells. However, other areas demonstrated osteoid formation with fine calcifications and severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures, as well as osteoid-entrapped, malignant-appearing cells. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma.

The other choices are incorrect. Recurrent olfactory neuroblastoma is unlikely, as the patient was treated with radiation and chemotherapy for this tumor 10 years prior to the development of the current lesion. Recurrent retinoblastoma is also unlikely, as the patient had bilateral enucleation of his eyes at an early age. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma, and it is not typically associated with the development of bone tumors.

Chondroma is a benign tumor of cartilage. It is the most common type of bone tumor. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage. It is a rare tumor that usually occurs in people in their 20s and 30s. Low-grade chondrosarcoma is a less aggressive type of chondrosarcoma.

The patient in the case presented with a deep nasal septal mass. The mass was expansile, which means it was growing and pushing on the surrounding tissue. The mass also had internal matrix mineralization, which means it contained calcium deposits. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.

Cavernous hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels. They are the most common type of hemangioma. Hemangiomas are usually found in children, but they can occur in adults as well. They are most commonly found in the skin, but they can also occur in other organs, including the liver, brain, and lungs.

Cavernous hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any symptoms. However, they can sometimes grow large enough to cause problems, such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction of a blood vessel. Treatment of cavernous hemangiomas is usually not necessary, but they can be removed if they are causing problems.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Chondroma is a benign tumor of cartilage, and it does not usually cause symptoms. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage, and it is more likely to cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and a mass. Low-grade chondrosarcoma is a less aggressive type of chondrosarcoma, but it is still a malignant tumor, and it is more likely to cause symptoms than chondroma.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common type of vascular tumor in children. Hemangiomas are usually present at birth or appear within a few weeks of birth. They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the head and neck. Hemangiomas typically grow rapidly during the first year of life, then gradually shrink over time. Most hemangiomas disappear completely by age 10.

A vascular hamartoma is a non-cancerous growth of blood vessels. It is made up of abnormal blood vessels that are present from birth. Vascular hamartomas can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head and neck. They are usually small and harmless, but can sometimes grow large enough to cause problems.

A chordoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the notochord, a structure that forms the backbone in the embryo. Chordomas can occur anywhere along the spine, but are most common in the lower spine. They are slow-growing tumors that can spread to other parts of the body.

An atypical meningioma is a type of brain tumor that starts in the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Atypical meningiomas are more aggressive than other types of meningiomas, and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 20s with a history of a benign retropharyngeal mass. She reported return of her symptoms after 11 months to include mouth breathing, snoring, and nasal obstruction with hyponasality and eustachian tube dysfunction. She also began to experience transient upper extremity paraplegias. She required hospital admission with steroid and anti-inflammatory treatment for partial resolution of symptoms. On examination, she was noted to have abnormal asymmetry of the posterior nasopharyngeal wall by flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy without any overlying mucosal changes. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a complete recurrence and enlargement of the retropharyngeal mass with dimensions of 4.2 (anterior to posterior) × 6.3 (transverse) × 5.1 (craniocaudal) cm. The mass was heterogeneously hyperenhancing on T1-weighting and centered at the atlantoaxial joint causing erosion of the upper dens, anterior arch of C1, and the basion.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a vascular hamartoma. Vascular hamartomas are benign tumors of blood vessels that are present from birth. They are usually small and harmless, but can sometimes grow large enough to cause problems. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a vascular hamartoma. The magnetic resonance imaging findings are also consistent with a vascular hamartoma. The mass is heterogeneously hyperenhancing on T1-weighting, which is a characteristic finding of vascular hamartomas. The mass is also centered at the atlantoaxial joint, which is a common location for vascular hamartomas.

The other possible diagnoses are hemangioma, chordoma, and atypical meningioma. Hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels that are the most common type of vascular tumor in children. Chordomas are rare types of cancer that start in the notochord, a structure that forms the backbone in the embryo. Atypical meningiomas are types of brain tumors that start in the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a hemangioma. Hemangiomas are usually present at birth or appear within a few weeks of birth. The patient in this case did not have a hemangioma at birth and did not develop symptoms until she was in her 20s. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging findings are also not consistent with a hemangioma. Hemangiomas are usually not heterogeneously hyperenhancing on T1-weighting.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a chordoma. Chordomas are rare tumors that usually occur in adults. The patient in this case is a young woman. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging findings are also not consistent with a chordoma. Chordomas are usually not centered at the atlantoaxial joint.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an atypical meningioma. Atypical meningiomas are usually diagnosed in adults. The patient in this case is a young woman. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging findings are also not consistent with an atypical meningioma. Atypical meningiomas are usually not centered at the atlantoaxial joint.

A cholesteatoma is a growth of skin cells that can develop in the middle ear or mastoid bone. It is not cancerous, but it can grow and destroy surrounding tissue. Aggressive cholesteatoma is a rare type of cholesteatoma that grows more quickly and is more likely to spread than other types of cholesteatoma.

The patient in the case presented with a history of purulent ear drainage, which is a common symptom of cholesteatoma. The patient also had a large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement, which is a characteristic finding of cholesteatoma. The patient's imaging studies were also consistent with cholesteatoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Complicated acute otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that can cause inflammation and pain. It is not a growth of skin cells, and it does not typically cause a cerebellar lesion.
* Metastatic disease is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. The patient's history and imaging studies do not suggest that she has cancer.
* Endolymphatic sac tumor is a rare tumor that grows in the endolymphatic sac, which is a structure in the inner ear. It is not a growth of skin cells, and it does not typically cause a cerebellar lesion.

A cholesterol granuloma is a benign, non-neoplastic lesion that is characterized by a collection of cholesterol crystals and macrophages. It is most commonly seen in the middle ear and mastoid, but can also occur in the petrous apex. Cholesterol granulomas are typically asymptomatic, but can cause pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.

An endolymphatic sac tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm that arises from the endolymphatic sac. It is most commonly seen in adults, but can also occur in children. Endolymphatic sac tumors are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. However, they can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and headaches. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-cancerous disorder that affects the Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It is most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. Langerhans cell histiocytosis can affect any part of the body, but is most commonly seen in the bone, skin, and lymph nodes. Symptoms vary depending on the affected organ. Treatment is typically with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a young, previously healthy girl who presented with a 10-day history of progressive, left-sided facial palsy accompanied by ipsilateral hearing loss and decreased facial sensation. She had not experienced headaches, disequilibrium, or tinnitus. She had no history of trauma, and there was no response to steroids. Findings from a physical examination were notable for left House-Brackmann grade III/VI facial palsy, hypoesthesia in left trigeminal nerve distribution, and no left audiologic responses to bone or air stimuli. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a left petrous apex expansile lesion involving the internal auditory canal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-circumscribed lesion extending into the fundus of the internal auditory canal. There was a fluid-fluid level in the lesion, consistent with presence of blood products. The displaced adjacent cranial nerve V extended along the surface of the lesion. After the administration of an intravenous contrast agent, there was a nodular focus of enhancement at the anterior aspect of the lesion and linear areas of enhancement at the periphery and of internal septations. The lesion was completely excised via a middle fossa craniotomy. Postoperatively, the patient regained full function of all cranial nerve deficits, including the hearing loss.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is an aneurysmal bone cyst. Aneurysmal bone cysts are typically seen in children and young adults, and are most common in the long bones of the extremities. However, they can also occur in the skull, including the petrous apex. Aneurysmal bone cysts are characterized by a blood-filled cavity surrounded by a thin wall of bone. They can cause symptoms related to pressure on surrounding structures, such as pain, hearing loss, and facial paralysis. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

The other options are less likely in this case. Cholesterol granulomas are typically seen in the middle ear and mastoid, and are not associated with facial paralysis. Endolymphatic sac tumors are rare, and are not associated with facial paralysis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a systemic disorder that can affect any part of the body, but is not typically associated with facial paralysis.

 75%|███████▌  | 1149/1525 [4:42:06<1:30:23, 14.42s/it]The correct answer is C. Primary lymphoma of bone.

The patient is a white woman in her 60s with a medical history of multiple joint replacements related to osteoarthritis. She presented with left leg pain that started approximately 3 months prior and had progressively worsened with interval difficulty weight bearing and ambulating up and down stairs. The patient noted night sweats 2 weeks prior to presentation but denied any associated fevers, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, or change in appetite. Physical examination revealed limited range of motion of the left leg related to pain. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL and a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of 599 u/L. Serum protein electrophoresis testing did not detect a monoclonal protein. A plain radiograph of the left femur showed a 15-cm area of moderate destruction in the proximal femoral shaft extending distally from the level of the lesser trochanter with concern for impending fracture. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not visualize any metastatic disease, and results were negative for lymph node enlargement. A nuclear medicine bone scan demonstrated increased uptake in the left femur with no other focal abnormalities. The patient underwent a CT-guided needle biopsy of the left femur.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with a solitary bone lesion includes a wide range of conditions, including primary bone tumors, metastatic tumors, and benign bone lesions. The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of primary lymphoma of bone. The patient's age, sex, and medical history are all risk factors for lymphoma. The patient's pain is consistent with a bone tumor, and the night sweats are consistent with lymphoma. The laboratory findings are nonspecific, but the elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase level is a non-specific marker of inflammation. The plain radiograph shows a destructive lesion in the proximal femur, which is a classic finding in lymphoma. The CT scan shows no evidence of metastatic disease, which is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The nuclear medicine bone scan shows increased uptake in the left femur, which is also consistent with lymphoma. The biopsy specimen shows a proliferation of lymphocytes, which is diagnostic of lymphoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Fibrosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of bone that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is not a common cause of bone pain in older adults.
* Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a rare condition in which a single plasma cell tumor develops in bone. It is not a common cause of bone pain in older adults.
* Fibrous dysplasia is a benign condition in which there is abnormal growth of fibrous tissue in bone. It is not a common cause of bone pain in older adults.

 75%|███████▌  | 1150/1525 [4:42:22<1:34:17, 15.09s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain trace element levels.

The patient has a history of metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the past year. TPN is a type of intravenous feeding that provides all of the nutrients that the body needs. However, TPN can also lead to deficiencies in trace elements, which are minerals that are essential for human health.

The patient's rash is a possible sign of a trace element deficiency. The most common trace element deficiencies associated with TPN are zinc, copper, and selenium. Zinc deficiency can cause a rash that is characterized by redness, scaling, and itching. Copper deficiency can also cause a rash, as well as hair loss and gastrointestinal problems. Selenium deficiency can cause a rash, as well as fatigue, muscle weakness, and hair loss.

To determine if the patient has a trace element deficiency, the doctor should order blood tests to measure the levels of zinc, copper, and selenium. If the levels of these minerals are low, the doctor can prescribe supplements to correct the deficiency.

The other answer choices are not correct. A skin biopsy is not necessary to diagnose a trace element deficiency. Topical steroid cream is not effective for treating a trace element deficiency. A paraneoplastic panel is a test that is used to screen for cancer-related antibodies. This test is not indicated in this patient, who has a history of metastatic cancer and is already receiving treatment for his cancer.

 75%|███████▌  | 1151/1525 [4:42:36<1:30:46, 14.56s/it]The correct answer is A. The patient has a low-normal serum erythropoietin level. She should be tested for JAK2V16F mutation status.

The patient's elevated hemoglobin level is likely due to polycythemia vera, a clonal stem cell disorder characterized by an increase in red blood cell production. Polycythemia vera is associated with a number of JAK2 mutations, including JAK2V16F. Testing for JAK2V16F mutation is the most accurate way to diagnose polycythemia vera.

The other choices are incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect because the patient's family history is not relevant to the diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Polycythemia vera is a sporadic disorder, not a familial disorder.

Choice C is incorrect because the patient's elevated hematocrit level is not likely due to secondary causes, such as dehydration or smoking. Secondary causes of elevated hematocrit level are usually associated with a normal or high serum erythropoietin level.

Choice D is incorrect because the patient's elevated hematocrit level is not likely due to dehydration. Dehydration is associated with a low red blood cell mass and a high plasma volume. The patient's physical examination revealed normal heart sounds and no splenomegaly, which are not consistent with dehydration.

 76%|███████▌  | 1152/1525 [4:42:52<1:33:52, 15.10s/it]The correct answer is C: Order active rewarming.

The patient is hypothermic, with a core temperature of 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Hypothermia is a medical emergency, and it is important to rewarm the patient as quickly as possible. Active rewarming is the most effective way to rewarm a hypothermic patient. It involves using external heat sources, such as warm blankets, heated intravenous fluids, and heated air blankets.

A coronary angiogram is not necessary in this patient because he does not have any symptoms of coronary artery disease. A temporary transvenous pacemaker placement is not necessary in this patient because he does not have any signs of heart block. Urgent hemodialysis is not necessary in this patient because he does not have any signs of kidney failure.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* **A: Order an emergency coronary angiogram**

An emergency coronary angiogram is a procedure that is used to diagnose and treat coronary artery disease. It is not necessary in this patient because he does not have any symptoms of coronary artery disease.

* **B: Order urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement**

A temporary transvenous pacemaker is a device that is used to regulate the heart rate. It is not necessary in this patient because he does not have any signs of heart block.

* **D: Order urgent hemodialysis**

Urgent hemodialysis is a procedure that is used to remove waste products from the blood. It is not necessary in this patient because he does not have any signs of kidney failure.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Order active rewarming. This is the most effective way to rewarm a hypothermic patient.

 76%|███████▌  | 1153/1525 [4:43:09<1:36:44, 15.60s/it]The correct answer is B. IgG4-related skin disease.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in multiple organs. The skin is involved in up to 25% of cases, and the lesions typically present as erythematous papules or plaques. However, the lesions in sarcoidosis are usually nonindurated, and they do not show the nodular inflammatory cell infiltration with dense lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and eosinophils that is characteristic of IgG4-related skin disease. Additionally, serum protein electrophoresis in sarcoidosis typically shows a monoclonal gammopathy, whereas in IgG4-related skin disease, it shows polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

Cutaneous lymphoma is a group of skin cancers that arise from lymphocytes. The most common type of cutaneous lymphoma is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which can present with erythematous papules or plaques. However, the lesions in cutaneous lymphoma are usually asymmetrical and poorly defined, and they do not show the nodular inflammatory cell infiltration with dense lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and eosinophils that is characteristic of IgG4-related skin disease. Additionally, cutaneous lymphoma is usually associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, which are not present in this case.

Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, including the salivary and lacrimal glands. The skin is involved in up to 20% of cases, and the lesions typically present as erythematous papules or plaques. However, the lesions in Sjögren syndrome are usually nonindurated, and they do not show the nodular inflammatory cell infiltration with dense lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and eosinophils that is characteristic of IgG4-related skin disease. Additionally, patients with Sjögren syndrome typically have other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, which are not present in this case.

In summary, the correct answer is B. IgG4-related skin disease. The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation.

 76%|███████▌  | 1154/1525 [4:43:25<1:37:54, 15.83s/it]The correct answer is C. Leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious disorder that occurs when the body's blood clotting system goes into overdrive. This can lead to widespread bleeding and organ failure. DIC is not a common cause of skin lesions, and the lesions that do occur are typically small, pinpoint hemorrhages. In this case, the patient's lesions are larger and more purpuric, which is more consistent with leukemia cutis.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that occurs when immune cells attack the walls of small blood vessels. This can lead to the formation of small, red, raised lesions that are often itchy and painful. The lesions of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are typically found on the lower extremities, but they can also occur on the arms, hands, feet, and face. In this case, the patient's lesions are located on the scalp, right dorsal hand, and left lower leg, which is not typical of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection of the skin. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer or diabetes. The lesions of cutaneous mucormycosis are typically black, necrotic ulcers that can be painful and disfiguring. In this case, the patient's lesions are not black or necrotic, and there is no evidence of an underlying immune system disorder.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis. This is a condition in which leukemic cells infiltrate the skin and cause inflammation of the blood vessels. The lesions of leukemia cutis can be varied in appearance, but they are often purpuric or erythematous papules or plaques. In this case, the patient's lesions are consistent with leukemia cutis.

 76%|███████▌  | 1155/1525 [4:43:42<1:39:20, 16.11s/it]The correct answer is C. Phaeohyphomycosis.

Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Aspergillus. It is a common infection, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Aspergillosis can affect the lungs, sinuses, brain, and other organs.

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Mucor. It is a rare infection, but it is often serious, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Mucormycosis can affect the lungs, sinuses, brain, and other organs.

Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by a variety of fungi, including Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, and Cladosporium carrionii. It is a rare infection, but it can be serious, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Phaeohyphomycosis can affect the skin, lungs, sinuses, and other organs.

Chromoblastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Fonsecaea pedrosoi. It is a rare infection, but it can be serious, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Chromoblastomycosis can affect the skin, bones, and other organs.

In this case, the patient is an immunosuppressed man in his 60s with a past medical history significant for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a lung transplant secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage kidney disease being treated with hemodialysis, and multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers. He presents with two closely adjacent dome-shaped erythematous nodules with edematous borders on his right elbow that had appeared two months prior. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed. The histopathologic findings show a mixed inflammatory infiltrate containing neutrophils, plasma cells, histiocytic, and multinucleate giant cells containing refractile spore-like structures. The fungal organisms were identified as Fonsecaea pedrosoi, a fungus that causes phaeohyphomycosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Phaeohyphomycosis.

The patient has a history of bilateral visual disturbances, including distorted vision in her right eye and a visual field defect in her left eye. She also has a recent onset of severe headaches and decreased hearing bilaterally. These symptoms are concerning for a neurological disorder, such as a stroke or tumor.

An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It is not a good test for diagnosing neurological disorders.

A carotid ultrasonography is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the carotid arteries, which are the arteries that supply blood to the brain. It is not a good test for diagnosing neurological disorders.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. It is a good test for diagnosing neurological disorders.

In this case, the patient's history and symptoms are concerning for a neurological disorder. An MRI is the most appropriate test to diagnose this condition.

The following are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* A. Consult otolaryngology for hearing evaluation: This is not the correct answer because the patient's hearing loss is likely due to a neurological disorder, not a problem with her ears.
* B. Order an echocardiogram: This is not the correct answer because an echocardiogram is a test of the heart, not the brain.
* C. Order brain magnetic resonance imaging: This is the correct answer because an MRI is a good test for diagnosing neurological disorders.

The patient is a woman in her early to mid-60s who presents with complaints of flashes and occasional floaters in her left eye for the past 2 weeks. She had been seen 7 months prior to presentation for a comprehensive eye evaluation. She was found to have a bilateral posterior vitreous detachment, and the results of her retinal examination at that time were normal. Her best-corrected vision was 20/20 OU, and the intraocular pressure in each eye was normal. An anterior segment examination of the left eye revealed trace keratic precipitates on the inferior cornea and 1+ cell. A posterior segment examination revealed 1+ vitreous cell. A photograph from a fundus examination is shown in Figure 1. The right eye was normal.

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a posterior vitreous detachment. A posterior vitreous detachment is a common condition that occurs when the vitreous gel that fills the back of the eye separates from the retina. This can cause flashes of light and floaters in the vision. In most cases, a posterior vitreous detachment is not a serious condition, but it can sometimes lead to retinal tears or detachments.

The patient's symptoms are not typical of a posterior vitreous detachment. The presence of whitish-yellow periarterial lesions on the fundus photograph is concerning for an infectious or inflammatory process. These lesions could be caused by a number of conditions, including retinal vasculitis, sarcoidosis, or toxoplasmosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform fluorescein angiography. Fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. This test can help to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms and to determine the extent of any damage to the retina.

The patient should also be evaluated for infectious and inflammatory etiologies. This may include a blood workup, a chest X-ray, and an electrocardiogram.

The patient should not be observed without further testing. The presence of whitish-yellow periarterial lesions on the fundus photograph is concerning for an infectious or inflammatory process. These lesions could be caused by a number of conditions, including retinal vasculitis, sarcoidosis, or toxoplasmosis.

The patient should not be treated with oral prednisone 60 mg daily followed by a slow taper. This treatment is not appropriate for the patient's condition. The patient does not have any evidence of an autoimmune or inflammatory condition.

The patient has conjunctival hyperemia and targetoid lesions on his trunk and extremities. Conjunctival hyperemia is redness of the conjunctiva, which is the thin, transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. Targetoid lesions are round or oval lesions with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a ring of erythema. These lesions are characteristic of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection caused by the Leishmania parasite.

The most common treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis is to excise the affected skin. This is done to remove the parasite and prevent it from spreading. Systemic and topical antibiotics are not effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis. A computed tomographic scan of the orbits is not necessary in this case.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. Start systemic and topical antibiotics: Systemic and topical antibiotics are not effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis. The parasite is not susceptible to antibiotics.
* B. Remove the foreign body with forceps: The patient does not have a foreign body in his eye. The redness and foreign body sensation are caused by the conjunctival hyperemia.
* D. Perform computed tomographic scan of the orbits: A computed tomographic scan of the orbits is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms of orbital involvement.

The patient has a history of weight loss surgery, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Vitamin A deficiency is a common complication of weight loss surgery, and it can cause conjunctival lesions and vision impairment. Therefore, it is important to measure the patient's vitamin A levels to rule out this possibility.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Anti-Ro and anti-La antibody testing is not indicated in this case. These antibodies are associated with a connective tissue disorder called Sjögren's syndrome, which is not a likely diagnosis for this patient.
* Option C: Biopsy of the lesions is not necessary at this time. The lesions are not suspicious for malignancy, and they are likely to resolve with treatment of the underlying vitamin A deficiency.
* Option D: Asking the patient about her use of antibiotics or anticonvulsants is not relevant to the diagnosis or management of this patient's condition.

Jejunogastric intussusception is a rare condition in which a part of the small intestine telescopes into the stomach. It is most commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea.

The diagnosis of jejunogastric intussusception is made with imaging studies, such as abdominal CT scan or upper endoscopy. Treatment is usually surgical, with the goal of reducing the intussusception and restoring the normal anatomy of the intestine.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

A. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of tumor that can grow in the gastrointestinal tract. It is the most common type of mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bleeding, and weight loss. However, they do not typically cause vomiting.

B. Gastric bezoar is a mass of undigested material that can form in the stomach. It is most commonly seen in people who have difficulty digesting food, such as those with gastroparesis or Crohn's disease. Bezoars can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, they do not typically cause bleeding.

D. Gastric polyp is a small growth that can form on the lining of the stomach. Polyps can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign polyps are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause bleeding if they are large or ulcerated. Malignant polyps can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, they do not typically cause bleeding.

 76%|███████▌  | 1161/1525 [4:45:03<1:26:20, 14.23s/it]The correct answer is C. Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps to regulate the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. When too much PTH is produced, the levels of calcium in the blood can become too high, and the levels of phosphate in the blood can become too low.

The symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism can vary from person to person. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may have a variety of symptoms, including:

* Bone pain
* Muscle weakness
* Fatigue
* Weight loss
* Nausea and vomiting
* Constipation
* Increased urination
* Increased thirst
* Headache
* Depression
* Anxiety
* Blurred vision
* Kidney stones

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Laboratory tests that may be used to diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism include:

* Serum calcium level
* Serum phosphate level
* Serum PTH level
* Alkaline phosphatase level
* Urine calcium level
* Urine phosphate level

If a patient is diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, the treatment will depend on the severity of the patient's symptoms and the level of calcium in the patient's blood. Treatment options for primary hyperparathyroidism include:

* Surgery to remove one or more of the parathyroid glands
* Medications to lower the level of calcium in the blood
* Lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise

The prognosis for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism is generally good. With treatment, the symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism can be controlled, and the risk of complications can be reduced.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hypervitaminosis D is a condition in which the body has too much vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium from the diet. When too much vitamin D is present, the levels of calcium in the blood can become too high. However, the patient in this case did not have any symptoms of hypervitaminosis D, such as bone pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, or weight loss. Additionally, the patient's serum calcium level was only slightly elevated, which is not consistent with hypervitaminosis D.
* Malignant neoplasm is a general term for a cancerous tumor. Cancer can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the location of the tumor. However, the patient in this case did not have any symptoms that are commonly associated with cancer, such as a lump, weight loss, or fatigue. Additionally, the patient's serum calcium level was only slightly elevated, which is not consistent with cancer.
* Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ in the body. Sarcoidosis can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the organs that are affected. However, the patient in this case did not have any symptoms that are commonly associated with sarcoidosis, such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Additionally, the patient's serum calcium level was only slightly elevated, which is not consistent with sarcoidosis.

 76%|███████▌  | 1162/1525 [4:45:20<1:30:21, 14.93s/it]The correct answer is A. Hungry bone syndrome.

Hungry bone syndrome is a transient state of hypocalcemia that occurs after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. It is caused by the rapid mobilization of calcium from bone stores in response to the removal of excess parathyroid hormone (PTH).

The patient in the case presentation has a number of features that are consistent with hungry bone syndrome. These include:

* Hypocalcemia (calcium level of 5.5 mg/dL)
* Tetany (twitching of facial muscles in response to tapping over area of facial nerve)
* Wide wrists with prominent styloid processes of the radius and ulna
* Radiographs showing widening of the physes of the distal radius
* High PTH level (798 pg/mL)
* Low vitamin D level (7 pg/mL)

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH. This leads to hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.
* Chronic kidney disease is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to properly filter waste products from the blood. This can lead to a number of problems, including hyperparathyroidism, but it does not cause hungry bone syndrome.
* PTH resistance is a condition in which the body's tissues do not respond normally to PTH. This can lead to hypocalcemia, but it does not cause hungry bone syndrome.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in the case presentation is hungry bone syndrome. This is a transient state of hypocalcemia that occurs after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. It is caused by the rapid mobilization of calcium from bone stores in response to the removal of excess parathyroid hormone.

 76%|███████▋  | 1163/1525 [4:45:34<1:27:44, 14.54s/it]The correct answer is C. Acute aortic dissection.

Acute aortic dissection is a tear in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. It is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.

The most common symptoms of acute aortic dissection are chest pain, back pain, and a feeling of faintness or lightheadedness. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

The diagnosis of acute aortic dissection is made with a CT scan or MRI of the chest. Treatment depends on the location and extent of the dissection. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the tear.

Acute viral pericarditis is an inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart. It is usually caused by a viral infection, but it can also be caused by other conditions, such as an autoimmune disease or cancer.

The most common symptoms of acute viral pericarditis are chest pain, fever, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, cough, and nausea.

The diagnosis of acute viral pericarditis is made with a physical examination and an ECG. Treatment usually involves rest and medications to relieve pain and inflammation.

Acute myocardial infarction is a heart attack. It occurs when a blockage in one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle causes the heart muscle to die.

The most common symptoms of acute myocardial infarction are chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and pain in the left arm or jaw.

The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is made with an ECG and blood tests. Treatment usually involves clot-busting medications and surgery to open the blocked artery.

Pericardial tumor is a rare type of cancer that starts in the sac that surrounds the heart. It can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of pericardial tumor is made with a physical examination, an ECG, and imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the tumor.

In this case, the patient's history of hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, and chronic kidney disease puts him at increased risk for acute aortic dissection. The patient's chest pain, back pain, and feeling of faintness are also consistent with acute aortic dissection. The CT scan of the chest shows a tear in the wall of the aorta, which confirms the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Acute viral pericarditis is a possibility, but the patient's chest pain is not typical of pericarditis. Acute myocardial infarction is also a possibility, but the patient's chest pain is not typical of myocardial infarction. Pericardial tumor is a rare possibility, but the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with pericardial tumor.

The patient in the case presented with progressive headache and left periorbital edema and pain recalcitrant to 4 days of outpatient oral antibiotics and 2 days of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone. His family history was positive for a similar presentation involving his mother. Physical examination revealed left orbital swelling and erythema with proptosis. Cranial nerve function and ocular range of motion were intact. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the paranasal sinuses disclosed extensive preseptal and postseptal orbital inflammation, bilateral frontal sinus opacification from a large left frontal osteoma occupying the inferior aspect of the left frontal sinus, and left epidural abscess. The patient underwent a bicoronal approach osteoplastic flap and endoscopic frontal sinusotomy for access and drainage of left frontal sinus disease and obstructive osteoma excision. In addition to frontal sinus osteoma, multiple 3- to 5-mm osteomas covering the calvarium were encountered. The patient’s postoperative period progressed without incident, and he was discharged home with oral antibiotics following resolution of symptoms. Histopathologic findings of operative specimens showed dense lamellar bone. Genetic analysis was positive for mutation in the APC gene at 5q21, resulting in a stop codon.

Gorlin syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple nevoid basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts, and skeletal abnormalities. Other features may include sebaceous cysts, fibromas, desmoid tumors, and medulloblastoma. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and genetic testing. Treatment is aimed at managing the individual manifestations of the syndrome.

Turcot syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas, and brain tumors. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and genetic testing. Treatment is aimed at preventing and treating the complications of the syndrome.

Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence of one X chromosome. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and genetic testing. Treatment is aimed at managing the individual manifestations of the syndrome.

 76%|███████▋  | 1165/1525 [4:46:06<1:32:43, 15.45s/it]The correct diagnosis is laryngeal schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and insulate nerve fibers. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head and neck region. Laryngeal schwannomas are rare, accounting for only about 1% of all laryngeal tumors.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal schwannoma. First, the patient is a man in his 50s, which is the age group in which laryngeal schwannomas are most common. Second, the patient has a history of throat pain, which is a common symptom of laryngeal schwannomas. Third, the patient's physical examination reveals a submucosal swelling in the right aryepiglottic fold, which is the location where laryngeal schwannomas are most commonly found. Fourth, the patient's imaging studies (CT scan and MRI) reveal a soft-tissue mass in the right aryepiglottic fold, which is also consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal schwannoma. Fifth, the patient's histopathologic examination reveals a tumor that is positive for S100 protein, which is a marker of Schwann cells.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from squamous epithelial cells. It is the most common type of laryngeal cancer. The patient in this case does not have any of the risk factors for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or alcohol use. Additionally, the patient's imaging studies do not show any evidence of invasion into the surrounding tissues, which is a characteristic of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
* Laryngeal neurofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells. It is similar to laryngeal schwannoma, but it is more likely to be associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2.
* Laryngeal paraganglioma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that produce hormones. It is most commonly found in the head and neck region. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of laryngeal paraganglioma.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is laryngeal schwannoma. The patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and histopathologic examination are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins build up in the body's tissues, causing damage to organs and other structures. There are several different types of amyloidosis, each with its own cause and symptoms.

Primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis is a rare form of amyloidosis that affects the airways. It is characterized by the buildup of amyloid protein in the submucosa of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including hoarseness, cough, dyspnea, and stridor.

The diagnosis of primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis is made based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and biopsy results. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the amyloid deposits. In some cases, other treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may also be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

* Endobronchial sarcoidosis is a condition in which abnormal cells called granulomas form in the airways. It can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. However, it does not typically cause calcification of the airways.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and weight loss. However, it does not typically cause calcification of the airways.
* Tracheobronchial osteochondropathia is a condition in which abnormal bone and cartilage form in the airways. It can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and stridor. However, it does not typically cause calcification of the airways.

A. Bacterial folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles caused by bacteria. It is characterized by small, red bumps on the skin that may be filled with pus. Bacterial folliculitis is usually not serious, but it can be painful and itchy. It is most common in areas of the skin where there is a lot of hair, such as the scalp, armpits, and groin.

B. Herpes infection is a viral infection that causes cold sores and genital herpes. It is characterized by painful blisters that break open and leave scabs. Herpes infection is usually not serious, but it can be very painful. It is most common in people who are sexually active.

C. Pityrosporum folliculitis is a fungal infection of the hair follicles. It is characterized by small, red bumps on the skin that may be filled with pus. Pityrosporum folliculitis is usually not serious, but it can be itchy and uncomfortable. It is most common in people who have oily skin.

The patient in the case report had a history of lumpectomy and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation can also damage healthy cells, which can lead to side effects such as skin reactions. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a reaction to radiotherapy. The rash is located on the skin that was exposed to radiation, and it is a common side effect of radiotherapy. The patient's history of herpes infection is not relevant to the diagnosis, as herpes infection is not a common side effect of radiotherapy.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the flat cells that line the inside of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and other parts of the body. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of oral cancer. It is usually caused by exposure to tobacco smoke or alcohol.

Invasive aspergilloma is a fungal infection that can occur in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with cancer or AIDS. It is caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Invasive aspergilloma can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and chest pain.

Condyloma acuminatum is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is characterized by the growth of small, cauliflower-like bumps on the skin or mucous membranes. Condyloma acuminatum is usually treated with topical medications or surgery.

Myeloid sarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. It is a rare cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers. Myeloid sarcoma is most common in people with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a type of blood cancer. The symptoms of myeloid sarcoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and bone pain.

The patient in the case presented with a history of MDS, which is a risk factor for myeloid sarcoma. The patient also had a polypoid mass on the right upper labial mucosa, which is a common presentation for myeloid sarcoma. The patient's biopsy results were inconclusive, but the mass had increased in size since the biopsy, which is a concerning finding.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is myeloid sarcoma. The other choices are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

The patient has a history of an annular skin lesion on her anterior neck that enlarged and developed central clearing. She lives in North Carolina, which is a Lyme disease-endemic area. She had no recent travel or known tick bite. She had no symptoms other than mild local itching. After several weeks, the patient’s mother applied over-the-counter topical antifungal cream and the lesion faded. After 10 days of antifungal therapy, the patient was evaluated by her pediatrician. Examination results were normal except for a 2.0-cm annular lesion with central clearing and peripheral flaking. The pediatrician ordered serologic testing for Lyme disease, prescribed 14 days of doxycycline based on the results, and referred the patient to an infectious disease specialist for evaluation.

The serologic testing showed a positive result for Lyme disease. However, the patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with an annular tinea corporis, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Tinea corporis is characterized by an annular lesion with central clearing and peripheral flaking. It is often treated with topical antifungal cream.

In this case, the patient's lesion improved after she applied topical antifungal cream. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is tinea corporis. The patient should be prescribed topical antifungal cream and doxycycline should be discontinued. There is no need for further testing, such as a skin biopsy or Lyme disease serology.

A. Complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. No further testing is indicated.

This is incorrect because the patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with an annular tinea corporis, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Tinea corporis is not treated with antibiotics.

B. Complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Repeat Lyme disease serology in 1 month to evaluate response.

This is incorrect because the patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with an annular tinea corporis, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics, but the patient's lesion improved after she applied topical antifungal cream. Therefore, there is no need to continue antibiotic treatment or repeat Lyme disease serology.

C. Obtain skin biopsy for Borrelia burgdorferi PCR.

This is incorrect because the patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with an annular tinea corporis, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Lyme disease is diagnosed with serologic testing, not with a skin biopsy.

D. Discontinue doxycycline and restart topical antifungal cream.

This is the correct answer because the patient's clinical presentation is more consistent with an annular tinea corporis, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Tinea corporis is treated with topical antifungal cream. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat Lyme disease, but it is not effective against tinea corporis.

 77%|███████▋  | 1170/1525 [4:47:16<1:19:52, 13.50s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels.

The patient has pancytopenia, which is a condition in which there is a decrease in all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Pancytopenia can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infection, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.

In this case, the patient also has hypothyroidism, which is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is essential for the normal production of blood cells. Therefore, it is possible that the patient's pancytopenia is caused by her hypothyroidism.

However, the patient's laboratory values do not support this diagnosis. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone level is normal, and her free thyroxine level is in the low-normal range. These findings suggest that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled and is not the cause of her pancytopenia.

The patient's peripheral blood smear shows microcytes and macrocytes, teardrop cells, absolute neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. These findings are consistent with megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is a type of anemia that is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate. Vitamin B12 and folate are essential for the normal maturation of red blood cells.

The patient's bone marrow biopsy shows erythroid hyperplasia with megaloblastic changes including asynchronous nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, nuclear budding, and multinucleation. These findings are also consistent with megaloblastic anemia.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's pancytopenia is megaloblastic anemia. The next step in the evaluation should be to obtain serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. MMA is a metabolite that is elevated in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.

If the patient's MMA levels are elevated, then she will need to be treated with vitamin B12 injections. Vitamin B12 injections are the most effective treatment for megaloblastic anemia.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Increase the levothyroxine dose: This is not the correct answer because the patient's hypothyroidism is well-controlled.
* C. Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for lymphadenopathy: This is not the correct answer because there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy on the patient's physical examination.
* D. Send parvovirus B19 serologies and polymerase chain reaction for viral DNA: This is not the correct answer because parvovirus B19 is not a common cause of pancytopenia.

The patient's presentation is consistent with cholesterol embolism syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when cholesterol crystals from an atherosclerotic plaque break off and travel through the bloodstream, lodging in small blood vessels and blocking the flow of blood. Cholesterol embolism syndrome can cause a variety of symptoms, including blue toes, pain, fever, and kidney failure.

The first step in the management of cholesterol embolism syndrome is to identify the underlying cause of the cholesterol emboli. This may require further testing, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or an echocardiogram. Once the underlying cause has been identified, treatment is aimed at preventing further embolization and treating the complications of the syndrome.

Treatment for cholesterol embolism syndrome may include medications to lower cholesterol levels, such as statins, and medications to prevent blood clots, such as anticoagulants. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the source of the cholesterol emboli.

The prognosis for patients with cholesterol embolism syndrome varies depending on the severity of the condition. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients make a good recovery. However, some patients may experience long-term complications, such as kidney failure or amputation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A, Obtain chest computed tomography angiography, is incorrect because a CT scan is not necessary to diagnose cholesterol embolism syndrome. The diagnosis can usually be made based on the patient's history and physical examination.
* Choice C, Obtain surgical consult for amputation, is incorrect because amputation is not usually necessary for the treatment of cholesterol embolism syndrome. In most cases, treatment with medications is effective in resolving the condition.
* Choice D, Start heparin and discuss thrombolytic therapy with the patient, is incorrect because heparin is not the first-line treatment for cholesterol embolism syndrome. Anticoagulants, such as warfarin, are more commonly used to prevent blood clots in this condition. Thrombolytic therapy, which uses medications to dissolve blood clots, may be considered in patients with severe symptoms or those who do not respond to other treatments.

Alkaptonuria is a rare, inherited disorder in which the body cannot break down a substance called homogentisic acid. This causes the buildup of homogentisic acid in the body, which can lead to a number of problems, including blue-black discoloration of the skin, cartilage, and eyes.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Argyria is a condition that causes a blue-gray discoloration of the skin due to exposure to silver. However, the patient in the case report did not have any history of exposure to silver.
* Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the production of heme, a substance that is necessary for red blood cell production. This can lead to a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and neurological problems. However, the patient in the case report did not have any of these symptoms.
* Diffuse melanosis in metastatic melanoma is a condition that causes the skin to become darkly pigmented due to the spread of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. However, the patient in the case report did not have any evidence of melanoma.

Neonatal candidiasis is an infection of the skin and mucous membranes of the newborn caused by the yeast Candida albicans. It is the most common fungal infection of the newborn, with an estimated incidence of 1-2%. The infection is usually acquired during passage through the birth canal of an infected mother.

Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a benign, self-limiting skin rash that occurs in 30-70% of full-term newborns and 10-40% of preterm newborns. The rash is characterized by erythematous macules, papules, and pustules that are distributed symmetrically on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are usually present at birth or appear within the first 24 hours of life and resolve spontaneously within 7-10 days.

Congenital dermatophytosis is a fungal infection of the skin that is acquired in utero or during the birth process. The infection is most commonly caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum, but other species, such as Trichophyton tonsurans and Microsporum canis, can also cause infection. The infection is characterized by scaling, erythematous patches that are often scaly and crusted. The lesions are usually located on the scalp, face, and trunk.

The histopathologic images of the umbilical cord section show fungal hyphae in the umbilical cord tissue. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of congenital cutaneous candidiasis.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical presentation of the patient. Neonatal candidiasis is not characterized by pink papules and vesicopustules that are distributed on the trunk, extensor upper arms, and upper legs. Erythema toxicum neonatorum is not characterized by fungal hyphae in the umbilical cord tissue. Congenital dermatophytosis is not characterized by pink papules and vesicopustules that are distributed on the trunk, extensor upper arms, and upper legs.

 77%|███████▋  | 1174/1525 [4:48:14<1:24:33, 14.45s/it]The correct answer is A. Galli-Galli disease.

Galli-Galli disease is a rare, chronic, acquired, and progressive dermatosis characterized by hyperkeratotic papules and reticulated hyperpigmentation on the face, neck, trunk, and extremities. The disease is more common in women and typically presents in the fourth to sixth decades of life. The etiology of Galli-Galli disease is unknown, but it is thought to be a reactive process secondary to an underlying inflammatory condition.

The clinical features of Galli-Galli disease are characteristic. The lesions are typically small, reddish-brown, hyperkeratotic papules that are arranged in a reticulated pattern. The papules may be pruritic, but they are usually asymptomatic. The lesions are most common on the face, neck, trunk, and extremities, but they may also occur on the scalp, palms, and soles.

The diagnosis of Galli-Galli disease is based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. The histopathologic features of Galli-Galli disease include hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and elongation of the rete ridges. The rete ridges may have a "bud-like" appearance. There is also focal acantholysis without dyskeratosis.

There is no cure for Galli-Galli disease, but the lesions may improve with treatment. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and oral retinoids. In severe cases, phototherapy may be used.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not present with the characteristic clinical features of Galli-Galli disease. Grover disease is a rare, acquired, and chronic dermatosis characterized by pruritic papules and plaques on the trunk and extremities. Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, autosomal dominant, and progressive dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented macules and papules on the face, neck, and upper extremities. Kitamura disease is a rare, autosomal dominant, and progressive dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented macules and papules on the face, neck, trunk, and extremities.

The patient has chronic recurrent pseudophakic endophthalmitis, which is a serious infection of the eye that occurs after cataract surgery. The most common cause of chronic recurrent pseudophakic endophthalmitis is a biofilm that forms on the surface of the intraocular lens. Biofilms are a community of bacteria that are attached to a surface and are surrounded by a matrix of extracellular material. Biofilms are very difficult to treat with antibiotics because the antibiotics cannot penetrate the biofilm.

The patient in this case has already been treated with intravitreal antibiotics and steroids, but the infection has recurred. This suggests that the infection is caused by a biofilm that is resistant to antibiotics. The only way to treat a biofilm is to remove the intraocular lens and capsule. This will allow the antibiotics to reach the bacteria and kill them.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Restarting topical prednisolone acetate and/or ofloxacin eyedrops would not be effective because the infection is caused by a biofilm that is resistant to antibiotics. Repeating vitreous biopsy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics would also not be effective because the antibiotics cannot penetrate the biofilm. Intravitreal and/or posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection may reduce inflammation, but it will not treat the infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and capsule.
It is reasoning
 77%|███████▋  | 1176/1525 [4:48:41<1:19:43, 13.71s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform laser iridotomy or iridoplasty.

The patient has a Baerveldt drainage implant in her right eye. The implant is designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by draining aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye into the subconjunctival space.

The patient's IOP has increased to 30 mm Hg, which is significantly elevated. This is likely due to a blockage of the tube of the Baerveldt implant. The blockage could be caused by inflammation, fibrosis, or a blood clot.

The first step in treating the patient is to unblock the tube. This can be done by performing a laser iridotomy or iridoplasty. A laser iridotomy is a procedure in which a laser is used to create a small hole in the iris, the colored part of the eye. This hole allows aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye into the posterior chamber. An iridoplasty is a procedure in which a laser is used to heat the iris, causing it to contract. This contraction can open up a narrow angle in the anterior chamber, allowing aqueous humor to drain.

If the laser procedures are not successful in unblocking the tube, the tube may need to be repositioned. This is a surgical procedure in which the tube is removed from the anterior chamber and placed in the sulcus, a space between the sclera and the conjunctiva.

Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which the vitreous humor, a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye, is removed. This procedure is not necessary in this case, as the patient's problem is not with the vitreous humor.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* **A. Apply digital pressure over the plate to dislodge the obstruction**

Applying digital pressure over the plate is not likely to be effective in unblocking the tube. The tube is located deep within the eye, and it would be difficult to apply enough pressure to dislodge the obstruction. Additionally, applying pressure to the eye could damage the cornea or the retina.

* **B. Reposition the tube**

Repositioning the tube may be effective in unblocking the tube if the blockage is caused by a kink in the tube. However, if the blockage is caused by inflammation, fibrosis, or a blood clot, repositioning the tube is not likely to be successful.

* **C. Perform laser iridotomy or iridoplasty**

Laser iridotomy or iridoplasty are the most likely to be effective in unblocking the tube. These procedures are relatively simple and can be performed in the office. Additionally, they are not associated with significant risks.

* **D. Perform vitrectomy**

Vitrectomy is not necessary in this case, as the patient's problem is not with the vitreous humor. Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and macular degeneration.

 77%|███████▋  | 1177/1525 [4:48:57<1:24:31, 14.57s/it]The correct answer is B. Refer for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NR2E3 gene. BVMD is characterized by the accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium, which leads to progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors and macula.

The patient's visual acuity of 20/50 is consistent with mild to moderate vision loss. The peripheral constriction on confrontation visual field testing suggests that the patient's visual field loss is predominantly peripheral. The absence of anterior chamber inflammation and the presence of posterior chamber intraocular lenses and liquefied vitreous with a few vitreous strands bilaterally are unremarkable. The poor foveal light reflexes, annular pattern of outer retinal hypopigmentation approximating the border of the temporal arcades, and inferotemporal clumped pigment deposits on fundus examination are all consistent with BVMD. The outer retinal foveoschisis and outer retinal thinning with interruptions in the ellipsoid in the peripheral macula on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) are also consistent with BVMD. The lack of disc leakage or angiographic macular edema on fluorescein angiography is reassuring, as it suggests that the patient's vision loss is not due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The ring of abnormal hyperautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence is also consistent with BVMD.

Given the patient's history, presentation, and findings on examination, the most likely diagnosis is BVMD. The next step in management is to refer the patient for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation. This will allow the patient and her family to make informed decisions about their future health care.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Perform an intravitreous injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is not indicated for BVMD. Anti-VEGF agents are used to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration, but they are not effective for BVMD.
* Option C: Order testing for antirecoverin antibodies is not indicated for BVMD. Antirecoverin antibodies are associated with a different condition called autoimmune retinopathy.
* Option D: Perform a vitreous biopsy is not indicated for BVMD. Vitreous biopsy is usually only performed to diagnose or rule out other conditions, such as infectious or inflammatory diseases.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by pain and stiffness in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and hips. PMR is more common in older adults, and it is often associated with temporal arteritis (TA), a vasculitis that affects the temporal arteries.

The patient's visual symptoms are likely due to optic nerve inflammation, which is a common complication of PMR and TA. The patient's vision is likely to improve with treatment of the underlying autoimmune disease.

The patient's serum chemistry and radiographs of the extremities will help to confirm the diagnosis of PMR and to exclude other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

* **A. Administer an intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent in the left eye** is incorrect. Intravitreous anti-VEGF agents are used to treat macular edema, which is a complication of diabetic retinopathy and other retinal diseases. However, the patient's vision loss is not due to macular edema, but rather to optic nerve inflammation.
* **B. Obtain neuroimaging of the brain and orbits** is incorrect. Neuroimaging is not necessary to diagnose PMR or TA. However, neuroimaging may be ordered to exclude other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or tumor.
* **D. Obtain serum titers of viral antibodies** is incorrect. Serum titers of viral antibodies are not necessary to diagnose PMR or TA. However, they may be ordered to exclude other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a viral infection.

Carotid atherosclerosis is a condition in which the walls of the carotid arteries, which carry blood to the brain, become thickened and narrowed. This can lead to a stroke, which occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked.

The patient in this case presents with several risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis, including age (45 years old), hypertension, and smoking. She also has a history of intermittent episodes of right hand and leg discoordination and paresthesia of increasing frequency 2 weeks prior to presentation. These symptoms are consistent with a stroke, which is a common complication of carotid atherosclerosis.

The imaging studies in this case show a near occlusion of the proximal left internal carotid artery. This is a sign of advanced carotid atherosclerosis. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the imaging findings.

A. Carotid artery dissection is a condition in which the wall of the carotid artery tears. This can lead to a stroke, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for carotid artery dissection, and the imaging studies do not show any evidence of a tear in the carotid artery.

C. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid artery is a condition in which the walls of the carotid artery become thickened and narrowed. This can lead to a stroke, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for fibromuscular dysplasia, and the imaging studies do not show any evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia.

D. Carotid aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the carotid artery. This can lead to a stroke, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for carotid aneurysm, and the imaging studies do not show any evidence of a carotid aneurysm.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Carotid atherosclerosis.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, aerobic bacillus that is commonly found in the environment, including soil and water. It is a opportunistic pathogen that can cause a variety of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is particularly virulent in patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with cancer or who are receiving chemotherapy.

The patient in the case presented with a history of acute exudative tonsillitis, which is a common infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. However, the patient did not have any other signs or symptoms of a streptococcal infection, such as fever, sore throat, or lymphadenopathy. Additionally, the patient's blood and throat cultures were negative for Streptococcus pyogenes.

The patient's purpuric lesions are consistent with a diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum, which is a skin infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ecthyma gangrenosum is characterized by the development of necrotic ulcers with a black eschar. The ulcers are typically located on the extremities, but they can also occur on the trunk or face.

The patient's rapid deterioration with onset of septic shock is also consistent with a diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS is characterized by fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis.

The patient's treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is also consistent with a diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is resistant to many antibiotics, so it is important to start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics until the specific pathogen is identified.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and treatment response are all consistent with a diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of genital herpes. However, HSV does not typically cause necrotic ulcers.
* Streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of strep throat. However, Streptococcus pyogenes does not typically cause necrotic ulcers.
* Neisseria meningitidis is a common cause of meningitis. However, Neisseria meningitidis does not typically cause necrotic ulcers.

The patient is a teenage girl with recurrent episodes of palpitations for 6 consecutive years. The resting 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no preexcitation or repolarization abnormalities. There were incessant multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block morphologic features. QRS complexes were negative in the rest of the precordial leads (V2-V6) and in leads I and avL, but positive in III, avR, and avF, suggesting a left (lateral) ventricular apical origin. The echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities. The patient was prescribed sotalol but her symptoms did not improve. Invasive electrophysiological mapping of the left ventricle endocardium demonstrated that the ventricular tachycardia probably originated from the epicardial surface of left ventricular apex.

The next step in management is to perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to define the pathologic substrate of the ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed information about the structure and function of the heart. It can be used to identify structural abnormalities that may be associated with ventricular tachycardia, such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Cardiac MRI can also be used to assess the function of the heart valves and to identify areas of ischemia or infarction.

In this case, cardiac MRI is likely to be helpful in defining the pathologic substrate of the ventricular tachycardia. This information will be useful in planning the next steps in management, such as whether to proceed with epicardial ablation or to implant a cardioverter defibrillator.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option A, map and ablate the epicardium, is incorrect because the patient has not yet undergone epicardial mapping. Option B, add a second antiarrhythmic drug and reassess the need for epicardial intervention after 3 to 6 months, is incorrect because the patient has already failed treatment with sotalol. Option C, implant a cardioverter defibrillator, is incorrect because the patient has not yet had a cardiac arrest.

 78%|███████▊  | 1182/1525 [4:50:12<1:25:38, 14.98s/it]The correct answer is B. Fibrous dysplasia.

Fibrous dysplasia is a non-cancerous (benign) disorder that causes abnormal growth of fibrous tissue in the bones. It is a relatively rare condition, affecting about 1 in 20,000 people. Fibrous dysplasia can occur in any bone, but it is most common in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, and the skull.

The cause of fibrous dysplasia is unknown. It is thought to be caused by a mutation in a gene called GNAS. This gene is involved in the production of a protein called Gsα, which is important for cell growth and differentiation.

The symptoms of fibrous dysplasia vary depending on the location and extent of the disease. In some cases, there may be no symptoms at all. In other cases, the symptoms may include pain, swelling, and deformity of the affected bone.

There is no cure for fibrous dysplasia, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, or medication.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not associated with the symptoms and findings in this case.

* Paget disease is a progressive disorder that causes the bones to become weak and brittle. It is not associated with hearing loss or tinnitus.
* Exostosis is a benign growth that occurs on the surface of a bone. It is not associated with hearing loss or tinnitus.
* Otosclerosis is a condition that causes the stapes bone in the middle ear to become fixed in place. This can lead to hearing loss. However, otosclerosis is not associated with a mass behind the tympanic membrane or findings on CT or MRI.

 78%|███████▊  | 1183/1525 [4:50:29<1:27:53, 15.42s/it]The correct answer is A. Angiosarcoma.

Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the skin, soft tissues, and liver. Angiosarcomas are usually very aggressive and can spread quickly to other parts of the body.

The patient in the case presented with a rapidly growing vascular mass within the thyroid. The mass was encapsulated and predominantly hemorrhagic and necrotic, without grossly identifiable thyroid parenchyma. Extensive sampling revealed pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and increased mitotic activity. There was evidence of angiogenesis and formation of nests around areas with organizing hemorrhage. Tumor cells showed strong membrane reactivity for CD31, confirming an endothelial origin of the lesion. Adjacent thyroid parenchyma showed multinodular goiter and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The neck dissection revealed normal lymphatic contents.

The findings in this case are most consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcomas are typically highly vascular tumors, which explains the hemorrhagic and necrotic appearance of the mass in the case. The pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and increased mitotic activity are also characteristic of angiosarcomas. The presence of angiogenesis and nests of tumor cells around areas with organizing hemorrhage are further supportive of a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. The strong membrane reactivity for CD31 confirms the endothelial origin of the tumor.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Multinodular goiter is a non-cancerous condition characterized by the presence of multiple nodules in the thyroid gland. The nodules in multinodular goiter are typically benign and do not grow rapidly.
* Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. Hemangiomas are typically small and slow-growing.
* Anaplastic (undifferentiated) thyroid carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas typically grow rapidly and spread quickly to other parts of the body.

 78%|███████▊  | 1184/1525 [4:50:45<1:29:38, 15.77s/it]The correct answer is B. Laryngeal actinomycosis.

The patient is a woman in her 90s with no significant medical history who presented with a chief concern of worsening hoarseness over several years. She had not experienced shortness of breath, gastric reflux, smoking, cough, dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, or chills. Findings from a physical examination were remarkable for a rough voice. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy revealed normal abduction and adduction of the vocal folds with a white sessile lesion starting at the right midfold on the superior and medial surfaces that crossed the midline to involve the entire left vocal fold as shown in the Figure, A. Histopathologic images of the biopsied lesion are shown in the Figure, B-D.

Laryngeal actinomycosis is a chronic, granulomatous infection of the larynx caused by Actinomyces israelii. It is a rare condition, accounting for less than 1% of all laryngeal infections. The most common risk factors for laryngeal actinomycosis are chronic sinusitis, dental infections, and head and neck trauma. The infection typically presents with a subacute or chronic course, with symptoms of hoarseness, dysphagia, odynophagia, and neck pain. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lesion, which shows characteristic sulfur granules on histopathologic examination. Treatment is with a combination of antibiotics, typically penicillin and streptomycin.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of the squamous epithelium of the larynx. It is the most common type of laryngeal cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of all cases. The most common risk factors for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma are smoking, alcohol use, and chronic laryngitis. The disease typically presents with hoarseness, dyspnea, and odynophagia. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lesion, which shows characteristic malignant cells on histopathologic examination. Treatment is with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the stage of the disease.
* C. Laryngeal candidiasis is an infection of the larynx caused by Candida albicans. It is a common condition, especially in immunocompromised patients. The most common risk factors for laryngeal candidiasis are diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, and steroid use. The infection typically presents with hoarseness, dysphagia, odynophagia, and a white coating on the vocal folds. The diagnosis is made by culture of the lesion. Treatment is with antifungal medication, typically fluconazole.
* D. Laryngeal amyloidosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the larynx. It is most commonly seen in patients with multiple myeloma, but it can also occur in patients with other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. The disease typically presents with hoarseness, dyspnea, and stridor. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lesion, which shows characteristic amyloid deposits on histopathologic examination. Treatment is with supportive care, such as steroids and voice therapy.

 78%|███████▊  | 1185/1525 [4:50:57<1:22:46, 14.61s/it]The correct answer is D. Substernal goiter.

A substernal goiter is a goiter that extends into the mediastinum, the space between the lungs. It is the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass.

The most common symptom of a substernal goiter is a feeling of fullness in the chest or throat. Other symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and shortness of breath.

Substernal goiters are usually diagnosed with a physical examination and imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan. Treatment may involve surgery to remove the goiter.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass.

Thymoma is a tumor of the thymus gland, which is located in the anterior mediastinum. It is a rare tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers.

Teratoma is a type of germ cell tumor that can occur anywhere in the body. It is a rare tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is the most common type of cancer in the mediastinum, accounting for about 30% of all mediastinal tumors.

However, the patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms or signs that are typically associated with thymoma, teratoma, or lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is substernal goiter.

 78%|███████▊  | 1186/1525 [4:51:14<1:25:42, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is C. Radiation-induced myositis.

A. Metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer is incorrect because the patient had a surveillance CT scan at 3 months that showed that the right upper lobe tumor had decreased by 1 cm in all dimensions. This suggests that the cancer is not progressing and is therefore unlikely to be the cause of the patient's shoulder pain.

B. Rib fracture is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of a rib fracture, such as pain that is worse with deep breathing or coughing. Additionally, the patient's shoulder pain is localized to his right scapula, which is not a typical location for rib pain.

C. Radiation-induced myositis is the most likely diagnosis because the patient has a history of receiving radiation therapy to his right lung. Radiation therapy can cause inflammation and damage to the muscles, which can lead to pain and stiffness. The patient's symptoms are consistent with radiation-induced myositis, and the MRI findings show inflammation and edema in the muscles of his right shoulder.

D. Polymyalgia rheumatica is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica, such as fever, malaise, and morning stiffness. Additionally, the patient's shoulder pain is not symmetrical, which is a typical finding in polymyalgia rheumatica.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is C. Radiation-induced myositis. The patient's history of receiving radiation therapy to his right lung, his symptoms, and the MRI findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

 78%|███████▊  | 1187/1525 [4:51:26<1:20:14, 14.24s/it]The correct answer is D. The results indicate histopathologic discordance.

Histopathologic discordance is a term used to describe a situation in which the results of two different types of tests on the same tissue sample are not consistent. In this case, the results of the ER and PR tests are consistent with each other, indicating that the tumor is ER-positive and PR-negative. However, the result of the HER2 test is equivocal, meaning that it is not possible to determine whether the tumor is HER2-positive or HER2-negative.

There are several possible explanations for histopathologic discordance. One possibility is that the two tests were not performed correctly. Another possibility is that the tumor is heterogeneous, meaning that it contains different areas that are positive for different biomarkers. Finally, it is also possible that the tumor is truly discordant, meaning that it contains both ER-positive and ER-negative cells, or both PR-positive and PR-negative cells.

In this case, it is not possible to say for sure whether the patient has ERBB2 (HER2)–positive or ERBB2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer. Further testing, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may be needed to determine the HER2 status of the tumor.

Choice A is incorrect because the patient's tumor is ER-positive, not ER-negative.

Choice B is incorrect because the patient's tumor is PR-negative, not PR-positive.

Choice C is incorrect because the result of the HER2 test is equivocal, meaning that it is not possible to determine whether the tumor is HER2-positive or HER2-negative.

 78%|███████▊  | 1188/1525 [4:51:34<1:09:47, 12.43s/it]The correct answer is to obtain a skin biopsy from the upper back. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with diabetic scleredema (scleredema diabeticorum), a rare, chronic, progressive, and non-inflammatory skin disorder that occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by thickening of the skin, usually in the upper back and neck, but it can also involve the arms, legs, and face. The skin is typically woody indurated, nonpitting, and slightly erythematous. There is often associated pain, stiffness, and limitation of range of motion. The cause of diabetic scleredema is unknown, but it is thought to be related to abnormal collagen deposition in the skin. There is no cure for diabetic scleredema, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral steroids, and immunosuppressive drugs. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove thickened skin.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not specific to diabetic scleredema. A 24-hour urine protein test is used to screen for kidney disease. A 2D echocardiogram is used to assess the function of the heart. A thoracic computed tomography scan is used to assess the lungs. These tests are not necessary in the diagnosis or management of diabetic scleredema.

In conclusion, the correct answer is to obtain a skin biopsy from the upper back. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic scleredema and guide treatment.

 78%|███████▊  | 1189/1525 [4:51:50<1:15:59, 13.57s/it]The correct diagnosis is C. Petrified ear.

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis chronicus (CNH) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the ear cartilage. It is characterized by the formation of a small, painful nodule on the helix of the ear. The nodule is usually red, tender, and scaly. CNH is most common in men over the age of 50. The cause of CNH is unknown, but it is thought to be related to trauma, infection, or allergies. Treatment for CNH includes topical steroids, oral steroids, and surgery.

Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the cartilage in the body. It can cause inflammation and pain in the ears, nose, eyes, joints, and larynx. RP is a rare disease, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people. The cause of RP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Treatment for RP includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and surgery.

Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin, connective tissue, and organs. It is characterized by the thickening and hardening of the skin. Scleroderma can also affect the blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Scleroderma is a rare disease, affecting about 2.5 million people worldwide. The cause of scleroderma is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Treatment for scleroderma includes medications to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow, as well as physical therapy to maintain joint mobility.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is petrified ear. Petrified ear is a rare condition in which the cartilage in the ear becomes calcified. This can cause the ear to become rigid and inflexible. Petrified ear is most commonly seen in people with chronic kidney disease, but it can also occur in people with other medical conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment for petrified ear is usually not necessary, but surgery may be an option in some cases.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis chronicus is a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the ear, but it does not cause the ear to become rigid. Relapsing polychondritis is a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the cartilage, but it does not typically cause the ear to become rigid. Scleroderma is a condition that causes thickening and hardening of the skin, but it does not typically cause the ear to become rigid.

It is characterized by the development of necrotic, ulcerated plaques on the skin, particularly of the extremities. The lesions are often preceded by erythematous, tender plaques. Lucio phenomenon can be life-threatening, and treatment typically involves combination therapy with corticosteroids and antileprosy drugs.

Erythema nodosum leprosum is a skin condition that occurs in people with leprosy. It is characterized by the development of tender, red nodules on the skin, particularly of the lower legs. Erythema nodosum leprosum is not life-threatening, and treatment typically involves antileprosy drugs.

Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis is a group of disorders that are characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin. Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis can be caused by a number of factors, including infections, drugs, and autoimmune disorders. It is not a specific diagnosis, and the treatment depends on the underlying cause.

Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a rare, systemic vasculitis that affects the small and medium-sized arteries in the skin. It is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules on the skin, particularly of the lower extremities. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa can be life-threatening, and treatment typically involves combination therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of leprosy and has developed necrotic, ulcerated plaques on the skin. This is consistent with the diagnosis of Lucio phenomenon. The other possible diagnoses are not supported by the patient's history or presentation.

EED is a rare, chronic, non-infectious inflammatory skin disorder characterized by the appearance of reddish-brown, raised plaques on the extensor surfaces of the arms, legs, and buttocks. The lesions are often tender and may be accompanied by itching, burning, and pain. EED is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly adults, and it is more common in women than men. The cause of EED is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. EED is not contagious and is not life-threatening. However, it can be a chronic and debilitating condition. Treatment for EED typically involves the use of corticosteroids, topical or systemic immunosuppressive agents, or phototherapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by the development of painful, necrotic ulcers. The ulcers are often associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and hematologic disorders. Pyoderma gangrenosum is not typically associated with the lesions described in the case.
* Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare, chronic, non-malignant disorder characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. The skin lesions of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis are typically red, raised, and scaly. They may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is not typically associated with the lesions described in the case.
* Sweet syndrome is a rare, acute, febrile, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by the development of painful, erythematous, tender plaques and nodules.

The patient is a 69-year-old white man with a history of hypertension and a 50-pack-per-year smoking history. He presents with 2 months of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness, left facial weakness, and diplopia in the setting of a 20.4-kg weight loss over the previous 6 months and new-onset urinary incontinence. Two months prior he had undergone lumbar vertebra 3–sacra vertebra 1 lumbar laminectomies performed for symptomatic spinal stenosis. Despite this, his leg weakness worsened. He denied headaches, fevers, cough, risk factors for immunosuppression, or travel outside of the northwestern United States.

On physical examination, the patient is thin and frail-appearing. His vital signs are normal. His mentation is intact. Cranial nerve examination reveals visual acuity of 20/400 OS, with an afferent pupillary defect and left-sided facial weakness including eye closure. He demonstrates profoundly decreased bulk and hypotonia throughout all extremities, with fasciculations apparent across his chest and lower extremities. Lower extremity muscle strength is graded 2/5 throughout with absent reflexes and intact sensation.

Initial laboratories reveal a normal complete blood cell count and chest radiography. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neuroaxis reveals leptomeningeal enhancement around the cerebral convexities, cerebellum, and spinal cord including the cauda equina. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies reveal a white blood cell count of 29/μL with a near-complete lymphocytic predominance, a red blood cell count of 363 × 106/μL, a protein level of 0.142 g/dL, and glucose level of 19 mg/dL. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology analysis did not identify malignant cells, with negative assay results for tuberculosis and fungal infections. Repeated flow cytometry did not identify abnormal B-cell or T-cell population. Whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography showed extensive leptomeningeal and nerve root hypermetabolism without evidence of a primary malignancy.

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of PCNSL–leptomeningeal variant. PCNSL is a rare, aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the central nervous system. It is most commonly seen in elderly patients with a history of immunosuppression. The most common presenting symptoms of PCNSL are headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of PCNSL is made on the basis of CSF cytology, which typically reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis with malignant cells. Imaging studies, such as MRI, may show leptomeningeal enhancement and/or mass lesions. The treatment of PCNSL is typically with combination chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 year.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Carcinomatous meningitis–primary adenocarcinoma of the lung: This patient does not have any risk factors for malignancy, and his imaging studies do not show evidence of a primary malignancy.
* C. Tubercular meningitis: This patient does not have any risk factors for tuberculosis, and his imaging studies do not show evidence of tuberculous meningitis.
* D. Neurosarcoidosis: This patient does not have any risk factors for sarcoidosis, and his imaging studies do not show evidence of neurosarcoidosis.

 78%|███████▊  | 1193/1525 [4:52:52<1:23:54, 15.16s/it]The correct answer is A. Observe; follow up in 4 to 6 weeks with SD-OCT.

The patient in this case has a history of fevers and mild upper respiratory tract symptoms 2 weeks before presentation, closely followed by a rash on his hands and thighs. A young family member had similar symptoms. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), a self-limiting inflammatory condition of the retina.

The most common presentation of APMPPE is acute, painless vision loss in one or both eyes. The visual loss is typically due to a neurosensory retinal detachment, which can be seen on ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Other findings on OCT may include retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) changes and subretinal fluid.

The management of APMPPE is typically conservative. In most cases, the visual loss will resolve spontaneously over a period of weeks to months. However, in some cases, the visual loss may be permanent. There is no evidence that treatment with corticosteroids or other medications improves the outcome of APMPPE.

In this case, the patient has a mild case of APMPPE with no evidence of active inflammation. The best management is to observe the patient closely and follow up with OCT in 4 to 6 weeks. If the visual loss does not improve, then more aggressive treatment may be considered.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Start oral prednisone therapy: There is no evidence that treatment with corticosteroids improves the outcome of APMPPE. In fact, corticosteroids may increase the risk of complications, such as cataract formation and glaucoma.
* Treat with photodynamic therapy: Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that uses a laser to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This treatment is not indicated for APMPPE, which is a non-inflammatory condition.
* Treat with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injection: Intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are a treatment for retinal diseases that are caused by abnormal blood vessel growth, such as diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration. These injections are not indicated for APMPPE, which is a non-inflammatory condition.

Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses radioactive implants to deliver a high dose of radiation to a small area. It is not the best option in this case because the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion is not growing. Biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. It is not the best option in this case because the lesion is a cyst, which is a fluid-filled sac. A biopsy would not provide any information about the nature of the cyst. Observation is the best option in this case because the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion is not growing. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a type of imaging that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the eye. It is the best option in this case because it can provide information about the size, shape, and location of the lesion. It can also determine if the lesion is solid or cystic.

A carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) is a direct communication between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. This can occur due to trauma, surgery, or other medical conditions. CCFs can cause a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, chemosis, conjunctival injection, and pulsatile tinnitus.

The treatment of CCFs depends on the size and location of the fistula, as well as the patient's symptoms. In some cases, CCFs may be treated with conservative measures, such as bed rest and head elevation. However, most CCFs require treatment with surgery or embolization.

Embolization is a procedure in which small particles are injected into the fistula to block the blood flow. This can cause the fistula to close and the symptoms to resolve. DSA is a type of X-ray that is used to guide the embolization procedure.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Surgical plugging of the carotid cavernous fistula with a muscle patch is a more invasive procedure than embolization. It is also associated with a higher risk of complications.
* Option B: Conservative management is not an appropriate treatment for CCFs. CCFs can cause serious complications, such as blindness and stroke.
* Option C: Trabeculectomy or drainage procedure are procedures that are used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition that causes increased pressure in the eye. It is not a treatment for CCFs.

* The patient developed right-sided hand and face weakness 2 days after a surgical procedure. This is a typical presentation of an ischemic stroke.
* The patient's neurologic examination was remarkable for somnolence, right hemineglect, right facial droop with right hand weakness, right patellar hyperreflexia, and mutism. These findings are consistent with a right-sided hemispheric stroke.
* The patient's laboratory values showed a white blood cell count of 6.8 × 103/μL, platelet count of 248×103/µL, hematocrit level of 30.9%, hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, activated partial thromboplastin time of 40 seconds, fibrinogen level of 678 mg/dL, and normal urinalysis results. These findings are not consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process.
* The patient received naloxone, after which his alertness improved, he could say his name, and he could follow commands well. This suggests that the patient's symptoms were caused by a reversible condition, such as an ischemic stroke.
* Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a large area of infarction in the right parietal lobe. This finding is diagnostic of an ischemic stroke.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits is a rare condition that can occur after the administration of opioids. It is characterized by the patient suddenly recalling events that occurred in the past, often in a vivid and detailed manner. This condition is not typically associated with weakness or other neurological symptoms.
* Focal seizures with postictal hemiparesis is a condition that can occur after a focal seizure. The postictal hemiparesis is typically transient and resolves within a few hours or days. This condition is not typically associated with a large area of infarction on MRI.
* Acute demyelinating disorder is a group of conditions that can cause inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system. This can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and vision problems. However, acute demyelinating disorders are not typically associated with a large area of infarction on MRI.

A Warthin tumor is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that most often occurs in the parotid gland, which is located in front of the ear. It is caused by an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus.

An acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is usually slow-growing and does not spread to other parts of the body. It is the second most common type of salivary gland tumor in adults.

The patient in the case presented with a 4-week history of a slowly enlarging mass on the left side of the neck. Physical examination revealed a mobile, nontender, 4-cm mass in the left side of the floor of mouth. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the neck showed a 3.8-cm cystic neck mass in the left floor of mouth. An ultrasonography (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells arranged in clusters; no malignant cells were identified. Repeated US-guided FNA biopsy showed a hypercellular specimen composed of numerous fragments of bland-appearing cuboidal and columnar epithelium and granular debris, which was eosinophilic in cell block sections and papillary structures with fibrovascular cores. The hypercellularity was atypical, and a low-grade neoplasm could not be ruled out. At this point, the patient elected observation of the mass and a repeated biopsy. A core biopsy showed a well-differentiated papillary neoplasm with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and some degenerative changes. Immunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells were negative for the markers TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin. These results, with the morphologic characteristics, were most consistent with a low-grade salivary neoplasm. She underwent excision of the cystic floor of mouth mass and a level I neck dissection. Pathologic examination revealed a cystic, 2.5-cm encapsulated mass arising from a minor salivary gland.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is an intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papillomas are benign (noncancerous) tumors that arise from the lining of salivary gland ducts. They are the most common type of salivary gland tumor, accounting for up to 50% of all salivary gland tumors. Intraductal papillomas are usually small, solitary tumors that occur in women in their 40s and 50s. They are most often found in the parotid gland, but they can also occur in the submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and minor salivary glands. Intraductal papillomas are usually asymptomatic, but they may cause a mass in the neck, pain, or bleeding. Diagnosis is made by fine-needle aspiration biopsy or surgical biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision. Intraductal papillomas are rarely malignant, but there is a small risk of recurrence.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, Warthin tumor, and acinic cell carcinoma. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is usually slow-growing and does not spread to other parts of the body. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor in adults. Warthin tumor is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that most often occurs in the parotid gland, which is located in front of the ear. It is caused by an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus. Acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is usually slow-growing and does not spread to other parts of the body. It is the second most common type of salivary gland tumor in adults.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy results are most consistent with a diagnosis of intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papillomas are the most common type of salivary gland tumor, and they are usually benign. The patient's tumor was small, solitary, and located in the parotid gland. The biopsy results showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells arranged in clusters, which is consistent with a diagnosis of intraductal papilloma. The patient's tumor was also negative for the markers TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin, which further supports a diagnosis of intraductal papilloma.

Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear, which is located behind the eardrum. It is a common condition in children, but it can also occur in adults. The most common symptom of otitis media is ear pain. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, and difficulty hearing.

In some cases, otitis media can lead to complications. These complications can be serious, and they can require treatment with antibiotics. The most common complications of otitis media are:

* Mastoiditis: This is an infection of the mastoid bone, which is located behind the ear. Mastoiditis can cause severe pain, headache, and fever. It can also lead to hearing loss and facial paralysis.
* Labyrinthitis: This is an infection of the inner ear. Labyrinthitis can cause dizziness, vertigo, and hearing loss.
* Meningitis: This is an infection of the meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can be life-threatening.

The patient in this case has a history of otitis media. She also has a fever and a bulging, hyperemic tympanic membrane. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of otitis media. The CT scan shows that the patient has an abscess in the middle ear. This is a complication of otitis media.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

* Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that affects the Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis can vary depending on the part of the body that is affected. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms that are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the muscles. The symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma can vary depending on the part of the body that is affected. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms that are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin. The symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma can vary depending on the part of the body that is affected. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms that are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

 79%|███████▊  | 1199/1525 [4:54:17<1:17:13, 14.21s/it]The correct diagnosis is A. Endolymphatic sac tumor.

The patient is an elderly man with long-standing discharge and hearing loss in the left ear and mild dizziness. Biopsy of the soft tissue at the external ear canal showed granulation tissue. He did not have facial weakness. He was obese and had congestive heart failure and hypertension. Findings from the otolaryngologic examination were otherwise unremarkable. Advanced-stage mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear were noted. Computed tomography (CT) showed a soft-tissue mass in the mastoid and middle ear cavity extending to the external ear canal with no significant erosion of ossicles. During modified radical mastoidectomy, the mastoid cavity was found to be full of edematous, fragile soft tissue with mucoid secretions. The incus was intact but dislocated. Histopathological examination revealed a polypoid lesion showing typical papillary architecture with central fibrovascular cores and dilated glandular structures, lined by a bland-looking single layer of high columnar/cuboidal epithelial cells. No mitotic activity or necrosis was detected. The richly vascularized fibrotic stroma consisted of cholesterol clefts, foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, reminiscent of inflammatory granulation tissue. The epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin-7 (CK7), CK19, epithelial membrane antigen, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Ki-67 immunostain showed a proliferation index of less than 1%.

Endolymphatic sac tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the endolymphatic sac, a small structure located in the inner ear. They are most commonly seen in adults over the age of 50, and there is no gender predilection. The most common presenting symptom is hearing loss, followed by tinnitus, vertigo, and facial paralysis. On physical examination, there may be a mass in the external ear canal or behind the ear. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is typically surgical excision, with good long-term outcomes.

Choroid plexus papillomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the choroid plexus, a network of blood vessels and specialized cells that produce cerebrospinal fluid. They are most commonly seen in children, but they can also occur in adults. The most common presenting symptom is headache, followed by seizures, nausea, and vomiting. On physical examination, there may be a mass in the lateral ventricle of the brain. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is typically surgical excision, with good long-term outcomes.

Papillary meningiomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. They are most commonly seen in adults over the age of 50, and there is no gender predilection. The most common presenting symptom is headache, followed by seizures, nausea, and vomiting. On physical examination, there may be a mass in the skull or spinal cord. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is typically surgical excision, with good long-term outcomes.

Middle ear adenomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the epithelial cells lining the middle ear. They are most commonly seen in adults over the age of 50, and there is no gender predilection. The most common presenting symptom is hearing loss, followed by tinnitus, vertigo, and facial paralysis. On physical examination, there may be a mass in the external ear canal or behind the ear. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is typically surgical excision, with good long-term outcomes.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is A. Endolymphatic sac tumor. The other choices are incorrect because they are not associated with the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological findings of this case.

 79%|███████▊  | 1200/1525 [4:54:33<1:20:30, 14.86s/it]The correct answer is B. Isolated anosmia.

A cerebrospinal fluid leak is a rare condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks from the brain or spinal cord. CSF is a clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It helps to protect these structures from injury. A CSF leak can occur due to a number of conditions, including trauma, surgery, or a tumor. Symptoms of a CSF leak can include headache, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of pressure in the head. A diagnosis of a CSF leak is made based on a physical examination, imaging tests, and a lumbar puncture. Treatment for a CSF leak may involve bed rest, medications, or surgery.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, but most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary depending on the organs that are affected. Common symptoms include fatigue, fever, weight loss, and cough. Diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on a physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory tests. Treatment for sarcoidosis may involve medications, surgery, or other therapies.

An upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common infection that affects the nose and throat. URIs are caused by a variety of viruses, including rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses. Symptoms of an URI can include a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. Most URIs are mild and go away on their own within a week or two. However, some URIs can lead to more serious complications, such as pneumonia or sinusitis. Treatment for an URI typically involves rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications.

In the case of the teenaged girl, the most likely diagnosis is isolated anosmia. Isolated anosmia is a loss of smell that is not associated with any other symptoms. It is most commonly caused by damage to the olfactory nerves, which are the nerves that transmit smell signals from the nose to the brain. Damage to the olfactory nerves can be caused by a number of factors, including trauma, infection, and certain medications. In the case of the teenaged girl, the trauma to her nose at the age of 3 years is the most likely cause of her isolated anosmia.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. A cerebrospinal fluid leak is unlikely because the girl does not have any of the typical symptoms of a CSF leak, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Sarcoidosis is also unlikely because the girl does not have any of the typical symptoms of sarcoidosis, such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss. An upper respiratory infection is also unlikely because the girl's symptoms have been present for years, which is not typical of an URI.

 79%|███████▉  | 1201/1525 [4:54:47<1:19:12, 14.67s/it]The correct diagnosis is A. Thyroglossal duct fistula.

A thyroglossal duct fistula is a congenital anomaly that results from incomplete obliteration of the thyroglossal duct during embryonic development. The thyroglossal duct is a transient structure that connects the foramen cecum in the tongue to the thyroid gland. In most cases, the thyroglossal duct obliterates by the 12th week of gestation. However, in some cases, it may persist and form a fistula.

Thyroglossal duct fistulas are most commonly located in the midline of the neck, just below the hyoid bone. They may be associated with a cyst, which is a fluid-filled sac. Thyroglossal duct fistulas typically present in childhood with a history of intermittent drainage of purulent material from the fistula. The drainage may be triggered by infection, trauma, or stress.

The diagnosis of thyroglossal duct fistula is usually made based on the history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the extent of the fistula.

The treatment of thyroglossal duct fistula is surgical excision. The goal of surgery is to remove the entire fistula tract, including the cyst, if present. The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia. The incision is made in the midline of the neck, and the fistula tract is carefully dissected and removed. The cyst, if present, is also removed.

The postoperative course is usually uneventful. The patient may experience some pain and discomfort, which can be managed with pain medication. The incision will usually heal within 2-3 weeks.

The prognosis for patients with thyroglossal duct fistula is good. With proper treatment, the fistula can be cured. However, there is a small risk of recurrence, which is why it is important to follow up with a doctor after surgery.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Branchial cleft fistula is a congenital anomaly that results from incomplete obliteration of the branchial arches during embryonic development. Branchial cleft fistulas are most commonly located in the lateral neck, not the midline.
* Nonhealing surgical tract is a complication of surgery that can occur when a wound does not heal properly. Nonhealing surgical tracts are typically caused by infection, inflammation, or foreign material in the wound.
* Nocardia infection is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and pneumonia. Nocardia infection is not typically associated with a fistula.

The patient's history of progressive lower extremity pain after walking 1 block or ascending a flight of stairs is consistent with claudication, which is a classic symptom of Takayasu arteritis. The physical examination findings of weakly palpable femoral pulses and non-palpable pedal pulses are also consistent with Takayasu arteritis. The laboratory findings of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are also suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. The noninvasive arterial flow studies demonstrated an ankle brachial index of 0.60 on the right and 0.62 on the left with biphasic waveforms in the femoral, popliteal, and tibial vessels, which is also consistent with Takayasu arteritis. The subsequent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed mild stenosis of bilateral subclavian arteries and an abnormal-appearing infrarenal aorta, which are also consistent with Takayasu arteritis.

Middle aortic syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by narrowing of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with middle aortic syndrome.

An inflammatory aneurysm is a type of aneurysm that is caused by inflammation of the arterial wall. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with an inflammatory aneurysm.

Giant cell arteritis is a type of vasculitis that most commonly affects the large arteries of the head and neck. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with giant cell arteritis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis.

 79%|███████▉  | 1203/1525 [4:55:19<1:21:02, 15.10s/it]The correct answer is C. Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.

The patient is a previously healthy, African American man in his mid-60s with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis (compensated) who presented to the emergency department after collapsing at work with sudden-onset back and abdominal pain. He was hypotensive (blood pressure, 87/55 mm Hg) on arrival to the emergency department. The patient’s condition was rapidly stabilized and computed tomography with contrast demonstrated a large (12.4 × 10.2-cm) right hepatic mass with heterogeneous enhancement on arterial phase and intrahepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Emergency angiography was performed by interventional radiology, demonstrating active contrast extravasation originating from the right hepatic artery. Embolization was performed with Gelfoam and microparticles, resulting in hemodynamic stability and a quick recovery. Delayed liver resection was subsequently performed.

The most likely diagnosis is ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer and is a major cause of cancer death worldwide. It is more common in men than women and in people with chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis C cirrhosis. The most common presenting symptom is abdominal pain, which may be accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting. Rupture of a hepatocellular carcinoma can lead to massive hemorrhage and death.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely. A ruptured giant cavernous hemangioma is a rare condition that is usually found in women. A ruptured complex cystic liver mass is also a rare condition that can occur in people of any age. Spontaneous liver bleeding is a rare condition that is usually caused by a bleeding disorder or liver disease.

The patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, the presence of a large hepatic mass, and the findings on computed tomography and angiography all support the diagnosis of ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.

The CARD11 mutation is a variant of unknown significance. This means that it is not known whether the mutation is harmful or not. Some variants of unknown significance may be harmful, while others may not. It is not possible to say for sure whether the CARD11 mutation is harmful in this patient without further testing.

Ibrutinib is a drug that is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It works by blocking a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is important for the growth and survival of cancer cells. Ibrutinib has been shown to be effective in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including patients with mutations in the BTK gene.

However, ibrutinib can also cause side effects. The most common side effects of ibrutinib are fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects can include bleeding, infections, and heart problems.

In this case, the patient has a mutation in the CARD11 gene. This mutation is a variant of unknown significance. It is not known whether the mutation is harmful or not. It is also not known whether ibrutinib will be effective in treating this patient.

The patient should discuss the risks and benefits of ibrutinib with his doctor. The doctor can help the patient decide whether ibrutinib is the right treatment for him.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: CARD11 mutation is associated with ibrutinib resistance, therefore ibrutinib should not be used. This is incorrect because the CARD11 mutation is a variant of unknown significance. It is not known whether the mutation is harmful or not. It is also not known whether ibrutinib will be effective in treating this patient.
* Choice B: CARD11 mutation is found only in a subclonal population and thus ibrutinib should be avoided. This is incorrect because the CARD11 mutation is a variant of unknown significance. It is not known whether the mutation is harmful or not. It is also not known whether ibrutinib will be effective in treating this patient.
* Choice D: The significance of the amino acid exchange in CARD11 is a variant of unknown significance, so treatment with ibrutinib should not be considered. This is incorrect because the CARD11 mutation is a variant of unknown significance. It is not known whether the mutation is harmful or not. It is also not known whether ibrutinib will be effective in treating this patient.

The patient has a history of metabolic syndrome, which is a group of risk factors that increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for DR. The patient also has blurry vision, which is a common symptom of DR. The dilated examination of the retina shows signs of DR, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates.

Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that measures the average level of glucose in the blood over the past 2-3 months. It is a good test for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes. However, it is not a specific test for DR.

Hypercoagulable disorders are blood disorders that increase the risk of blood clots. They are not a common cause of DR.

Carotid ultrasound is a test that is used to assess the health of the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are the main arteries that supply blood to the brain. Carotid artery disease is a risk factor for stroke. However, it is not a common cause of DR.

MRI of the brain is a test that is used to assess the health of the brain. It is not a specific test for DR.

PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, excess hair growth, and acne. Women with PCOS may also have difficulty losing weight.

One of the main features of PCOS is elevated levels of testosterone. Testosterone is a hormone that is normally produced in higher levels in men than in women. However, women with PCOS can have high levels of testosterone, which can lead to the symptoms of the disorder.

The elevated testosterone level in the patient in the case is consistent with a diagnosis of PCOS. The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide evidence of PCOS.

* The normal fasting glucose level does not exclude the possibility of PCOS. Women with PCOS can have normal fasting glucose levels, even if they have insulin resistance.
* The normal luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio does not exclude the possibility of PCOS. The luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio is often elevated in women with PCOS, but it can also be normal.
* The diagnosis of PCOS does not require documentation of polycystic ovaries by ultrasonography. Polycystic ovaries are a common finding in women with PCOS, but they are not necessary for the diagnosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. The elevated testosterone level is consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

 79%|███████▉  | 1207/1525 [4:56:05<1:05:59, 12.45s/it]The correct answer is A. Drug-induced hyperkalemia. The patient is taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is a known cause of hyperkalemia. The patient also has chronic kidney disease, which makes him more susceptible to the effects of drugs that can cause hyperkalemia. The patient's potassium level is elevated, and he is experiencing symptoms of hyperkalemia, such as weakness.

Excessive potassium intake is unlikely in this case because the patient is not taking any potassium supplements and his diet is not high in potassium. Pseudohyperkalemia is also unlikely because the patient's electrocardiogram is normal. Transcellular potassium shift is a rare condition that is not likely in this case.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hyperkalemia is drug-induced hyperkalemia. The patient should be instructed to stop taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and to see his doctor for further evaluation.

Bullous amyloidosis is a rare, acquired, autoimmune disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the skin and other organs. It is most commonly seen in elderly patients with underlying chronic diseases such as multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, or rheumatoid arthritis.

The most common presenting symptom is the development of blisters on the skin, particularly in the groin, axillae, and other intertriginous areas. The blisters are typically flaccid and hemorrhagic, and they may be associated with pain, itching, and fever. Other symptoms may include purpura, macroglossia, and glossitis.

The diagnosis of bullous amyloidosis is made on the basis of a skin biopsy, which shows the characteristic deposition of amyloid fibrils in the dermis. The treatment of bullous amyloidosis is aimed at controlling the underlying disease and relieving the symptoms of the skin lesions. Treatment options include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and plasmapheresis.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease characterized by the development of blisters in the skin. It is most commonly seen in elderly patients. The blisters in bullous pemphigoid are typically tense and non-hemorrhagic, and they are not associated with pain or itching. The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is made on the basis of a skin biopsy, which shows the characteristic deposition of immunoglobulin G and complement C3 in the basement membrane zone. The treatment of bullous pemphigoid is with corticosteroids.
* Herpes simplex infection is a viral infection that can cause blisters on the skin. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The blisters in herpes simplex infection are typically small, grouped, and painful. They are often associated with fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of herpes simplex infection is made on the basis of a clinical history and examination, and the results of a viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The treatment of herpes simplex infection is with antiviral medications.
* Cutaneous candidiasis is a fungal infection that can cause blisters on the skin. It is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes, HIV infection, or other chronic diseases. The blisters in cutaneous candidiasis are typically small, grouped, and non-painful. They are often associated with redness, scaling, and itching. The diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is made on the basis of a clinical history and examination, and the results of a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or fungal culture. The treatment of cutaneous candidiasis is with antifungal medications.

This is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lips that is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells. Granulomatous cheilitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disorders, and medications.

In this case, the patient has a history of HIV infection. HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, making people more susceptible to infection and other diseases. Granulomatous cheilitis is a known complication of HIV infection.

The patient also has several other findings that are consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. These include the presence of erythematous papules at the vermillion border of the lower lip, edema of the lower lip, and fissuring of the tongue.

The patient's laboratory tests are also consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. His CD4 count is within normal limits, but his HIV viral load is undetectable. This suggests that his HIV infection is well-controlled, which is important because granulomatous cheilitis is more common in people with advanced HIV disease.

The patient's biopsy results are also consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. The biopsy shows a nodular, nonnecrotizing granulomatous dermatitis. This is a characteristic finding of granulomatous cheilitis.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and biopsy results are all consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. This is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Oral sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa that is characterized by the formation of granulomas. However, oral sarcoidosis is not typically associated with HIV infection.
* Postherpetic granulomatous reaction is a rare complication of herpes zoster infection. Herpes zoster is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. Postherpetic granulomatous reaction is characterized by the formation of granulomas at the site of the rash. However, postherpetic granulomatous reaction is not typically associated with HIV infection.
* Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn disease is not typically associated with granulomatous cheilitis.

Muir-Torre syndrome is a rare, inherited cancer predisposition syndrome that is characterized by the development of sebaceous gland tumors (SGTs) and internal malignancies. SGTs are the most common manifestation of Muir-Torre syndrome, and they typically occur on the skin, but they can also occur in the eyes, mouth, and other organs. Internal malignancies associated with Muir-Torre syndrome include colon cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.

The patient in the case presented with a rapidly growing, painful nodule on her upper cutaneous lip, as well as several smaller papules on her face and neck. These lesions are consistent with SGTs. The patient's family history is also significant for Muir-Torre syndrome, as her paternal grandfather died from melanoma and her father died from colon cancer. This family history increases the likelihood that the patient has Muir-Torre syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Cowden syndrome is a genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of benign tumors of the skin, mucous membranes, and endocrine glands. Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of benign tumors of the hair follicles, skin, and kidneys. Basal cell nevus syndrome is a genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas.

The patient presented with acquired color blindness and visual loss, as well as hair loss, a facial rash, hoarseness, and painful peripheral neuropathy in his feet. These symptoms are consistent with a number of conditions, including heavy metal poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including optic nerve atrophy, which is the loss of nerve fibers in the optic nerve. This can lead to visual loss, including color blindness.

To test for heavy metal poisoning, a doctor will order a blood and urine test. These tests can detect the presence of heavy metals in the body. If heavy metals are found, the doctor will then determine the source of the poisoning and treat the patient accordingly.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option A, test for mitochondrial optic neuropathies, is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of mitochondrial optic neuropathies. Option C, check vitamin B12 levels and ask about smoking history, is incorrect because the patient's vitamin B12 levels are normal and he does not smoke. Option D, rule out an underlying neoplastic process, is incorrect because there is no evidence of a neoplastic process in the patient's history or physical examination.

GCA is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the temporal arteries, causing headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness. It can also cause vision loss, which is usually due to ischemia of the optic nerve.

The diagnosis of GCA is made with a temporal artery biopsy. If the biopsy is positive, the patient will be treated with high-dose steroids. This treatment can usually reverse the vision loss and other symptoms of GCA.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Refer patient to primary care physician for management of his hypertension: Hypertension is a risk factor for GCA, but it is not the cause of the patient's vision loss. The patient should be treated for his hypertension, but he also needs to be evaluated for GCA.
* C. Refer for rheumatologic workup: A rheumatologic workup may be helpful in diagnosing GCA, but it is not the only test that is needed. The patient also needs to have a temporal artery biopsy.
* D. Observe and reevaluate in 2 months: The patient's vision loss is not due to a chronic condition, such as glaucoma. It is due to GCA, which is a treatable condition. The patient needs to be evaluated and treated for GCA as soon as possible.

 80%|███████▉  | 1213/1525 [4:57:32<1:12:58, 14.03s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform skin biopsy for immunofluorescence.

The patient presents with a triad of symptoms: stomatitis, cutaneous bullae, and renal failure. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disease. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by the formation of flaccid blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The blisters are caused by the deposition of autoantibodies against the desmoglein 1 and 3 proteins, which are essential for the adhesion of skin cells. This leads to the separation of the skin cells and the formation of blisters.

The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris is confirmed by immunofluorescence testing. This test involves the application of a patient's serum to a biopsy specimen of skin or mucous membrane. If the patient has pemphigus vulgaris, the serum will bind to the desmoglein 1 and 3 proteins, which can be detected using a fluorescent antibody.

Treatment for pemphigus vulgaris is with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids suppress the immune system and help to prevent the formation of new blisters. In severe cases, other immunosuppressive medications may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Oral acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. This medication would not be effective in treating pemphigus vulgaris, which is an autoimmune disease. A renal biopsy is a procedure that involves the removal of a small piece of kidney tissue for examination. This procedure is not necessary to diagnose pemphigus vulgaris. Oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for pemphigus vulgaris. However, they would not be effective in treating the patient's renal failure.

 80%|███████▉  | 1214/1525 [4:57:45<1:11:27, 13.79s/it]The correct diagnosis is a cutaneous fungal infection. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient is a premature neonate, who are at increased risk for cutaneous fungal infections due to their immature immune system.
* The lesion is a 0.5-cm, circular, crusted papule with a surrounding rim of erythema. This is a classic presentation of a cutaneous fungal infection, such as candidiasis or tinea corporis.
* The biopsy specimen reveals epidermal necrosis with fungal elements within the superficial dermis. This is diagnostic of a cutaneous fungal infection.
* The patient was treated with topical antifungal medication and the lesion resolved. This further supports the diagnosis of a cutaneous fungal infection.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A pressure ulcer is a localized area of skin damage caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. This is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient does not have any risk factors for pressure ulcers, such as immobility or poor nutrition.
* Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and central nervous system. This is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient does not have any other features of neonatal lupus erythematosus, such as a rash on the face or scalp, joint pain, or seizures.
* Ecthyma gangrenosum is a serious bacterial infection that can affect the skin, particularly in immunocompromised patients. This is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient is not immunocompromised and the lesion does not have the characteristic appearance of ecthyma gangrenosum, which is a large, necrotic ulcer with a black eschar.

The patient's presentation is consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by the loss of bile ducts in the liver. This can lead to jaundice, pruritus, and other symptoms. Vanishing bile duct syndrome is most commonly associated with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation as well as vanishing bile duct syndrome.

Acute hepatitis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the liver. This can lead to jaundice, but it is not typically associated with the other symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the liver. However, it is not typically associated with the loss of bile ducts.

Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis is a type of cancer that can affect the bile ducts. However, it is not typically associated with the other symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient's presentation is consistent with this disorder, and the other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation as well.

The patient has a history of Merkel cell carcinoma, which is a rare skin cancer. The mass in the gastric fundus is a metastatic lesion from the Merkel cell carcinoma. This is supported by the following findings:

* The mass is located in the same anatomic location as the original Merkel cell carcinoma (the gastric fundus).
* The mass is metabolically active, as evidenced by the high uptake of FDG and 68Ga–DOTATOC.
* The mass is associated with enlarged lymph nodes, which is a common finding in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare type of tumor that can occur in the stomach. However, GISTs are typically not associated with a history of Merkel cell carcinoma.
* Type III neuroendocrine tumor of the stomach is a rare type of tumor that can occur in the stomach. However, these tumors are typically not associated with a history of Merkel cell carcinoma.

 80%|███████▉  | 1217/1525 [4:58:29<1:12:38, 14.15s/it]The correct answer is C. Hydatid cyst of the pancreas.

A cystic mass in the pancreas can be caused by a number of different conditions, including cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, hydatid cyst, and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN).

Cystadenoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that is made up of glandular cells. It is the most common type of cystic mass in the pancreas.

Cystadenocarcinoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that is also made up of glandular cells. It is much less common than cystadenoma.

Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection that can cause cysts to form in the pancreas. It is most common in people who live in areas where there is a lot of livestock, such as sheep and cattle.

Main duct IPMN is a type of precancerous tumor that can develop in the main duct of the pancreas. It is the most common type of IPMN.

The patient in the case report has a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the pancreas. These include:

* A painless mass in the tail of the pancreas
* Thrombosis of the splenic vein
* A family history of pancreatic cancer
* Normal laboratory values, including cancer antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels

Cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma are both rare in the pancreas. They are more likely to occur in women and in people who are over the age of 50. Cystadenoma is usually a benign tumor, while cystadenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor.

Hydatid cyst is more common in men than in women. It is most common in people who live in areas where there is a lot of livestock, such as sheep and cattle. Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection that can cause cysts to form in the pancreas.

Main duct IPMN is a type of precancerous tumor that can develop in the main duct of the pancreas. It is the most common type of IPMN. Main duct IPMN is more common in men than in women. It is most common in people who are over the age of 50.

The patient in the case report does not have any features that are consistent with a diagnosis of cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, or main duct IPMN. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hydatid cyst of the pancreas.

 80%|███████▉  | 1218/1525 [4:58:44<1:14:10, 14.50s/it]The correct answer is D. Metastatic carcinoma.

The patient is a woman in her 50s with a history of an ovarian cyst treated conservatively, and cosmetic breast augmentation. She has a 10 pack-year smoking history and denies alcohol or illicit drug use. Examination revealed distant heart sounds but otherwise had unremarkable results. An echocardiogram demonstrated a mass in the left ventricular myocardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to further assess the mass lesion. This revealed multiple intramyocardial masses involving the left ventricle, the largest of which measured 2.7 × 2.2 cm; aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy; and moderate pericardial effusion. Computed tomographic imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast failed to reveal discrete masses or lymphadenopathy elsewhere. A transcutaneous biopsy of the left ventricular mass was nondiagnostic.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic carcinoma. The patient's history of breast augmentation increases her risk of developing breast cancer, which is the most common type of cancer to metastasize to the heart. The patient's presentation is also consistent with metastatic carcinoma, with multiple intramyocardial masses, aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy, and a pericardial effusion. The transcutaneous biopsy was nondiagnostic, but this is not surprising given that the heart is a difficult organ to biopsy.

The other choices are less likely. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is not typically associated with cardiac masses. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It is also not typically associated with cardiac masses. Rhabdomyoma is a type of tumor that affects the heart muscle. It is most commonly seen in children, but it can also occur in adults. It is not typically associated with a history of breast augmentation or a presentation with multiple intramyocardial masses, aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy, and a pericardial effusion.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic carcinoma. The patient's history of breast augmentation increases her risk of developing breast cancer, which is the most common type of cancer to metastasize to the heart. The patient's presentation is also consistent with metastatic carcinoma, with multiple intramyocardial masses, aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy, and a pericardial effusion. The transcutaneous biopsy was nondiagnostic, but this is not surprising given that the heart is a difficult organ to biopsy.

 80%|███████▉  | 1219/1525 [4:58:58<1:12:21, 14.19s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain a skin biopsy.

The patient has a generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash, without fevers or other constitutional symptoms. Physical examination showed multiple red-brown plaques and papules of various sizes on the chest, abdomen, back, and limbs. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia (white blood cells, 1460/μL; hemoglobin, 8.3 g/dL; and platelets, 99 000/μL). A follow-up computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen showed no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis.

The most likely diagnosis is a drug reaction, specifically to trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that is used to treat breast cancer. It works by binding to a protein on the surface of cancer cells, called HER2. This binding causes the cancer cells to die.

Trastuzumab can cause a number of side effects, including skin rash. The rash is usually mild and goes away on its own. However, in some cases, the rash can be severe and require treatment.

The best way to diagnose a drug reaction is to obtain a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. This can help to determine the cause of the rash and to rule out other possible causes.

If the skin biopsy shows that the rash is caused by trastuzumab, the treatment will depend on the severity of the rash. In mild cases, the rash may go away on its own. However, in more severe cases, the rash may require treatment with topical steroids or oral steroids. In some cases, it may be necessary to discontinue trastuzumab.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Discontinue trastuzumab: This is not the best option because the rash is likely caused by trastuzumab. Discontinuation of trastuzumab could make the rash worse.
* C. Prescribe topical steroids: Topical steroids may be helpful in treating mild cases of drug rash. However, in this case, the rash is severe and requires treatment with oral steroids.
* D. Perform a screening test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin): This is not the best option because the rash is not consistent with syphilis.

 80%|████████  | 1220/1525 [4:59:11<1:10:25, 13.85s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures.

The patient has a gradually worsening tattoo lesion that is not responding to topical hydrocortisone cream. This suggests that the lesion may be caused by an infection, such as a bacterial, fungal, or acid-fast bacillary infection. A punch biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the lesion and sent to a laboratory for testing. This will help to determine the cause of the infection and the best course of treatment.

Prescribing oral antibiotics or higher-potency topical steroids without first performing a biopsy is not advisable. Oral antibiotics can be harmful if they are not needed, and higher-potency topical steroids can thin the skin and increase the risk of infection. Reassuring the patient and following up in 2 weeks is also not advisable, as the lesion may continue to worsen in the meantime.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures. This will help to determine the cause of the infection and the best course of treatment.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* A. Prescribe oral antibiotics: Oral antibiotics are not always necessary for treating infections of the skin. In some cases, topical antibiotics may be sufficient. Oral antibiotics can be harmful if they are not needed, and they can also interact with other medications that the patient is taking.
* B. Prescribe higher-potency topical steroids: Higher-potency topical steroids can thin the skin and increase the risk of infection. They should only be used when necessary, and they should be used for the shortest possible amount of time.
* C. Perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures: A punch biopsy is a safe and effective procedure that can help to determine the cause of an infection. It is the best way to diagnose an infection of the skin.
* D. Reassure patient and follow up in 2 weeks: Reassuring the patient and following up in 2 weeks is not advisable, as the lesion may continue to worsen in the meantime. The patient should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible so that the cause of the infection can be determined and the best course of treatment can be started.

 80%|████████  | 1221/1525 [4:59:23<1:08:32, 13.53s/it]The correct answer is C. The patient’s probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer.

The patient is a 59-year-old white man in good health, with no family history of prostate cancer. He previously made an informed decision to undergo prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. His PSA history is displayed in the Table.

PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. It is found in the blood, and its level can be used to screen for prostate cancer. A normal PSA level is less than 4 ng/mL. A PSA level of 4 to 10 ng/mL is considered an elevated level, and a PSA level of greater than 10 ng/mL is considered a high level.

The patient's PSA level has been steadily rising over the past few years. His current PSA level is 12.5 ng/mL. This is a high level, and it is concerning for prostate cancer. However, there are other possible causes of an elevated PSA level, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland.

The patient's digital rectal examination (DRE) revealed an enlarged prostate without nodules. This is a finding that is consistent with BPH. However, it is also a finding that can be seen in prostate cancer.

The patient's PSA level and DRE findings are concerning for prostate cancer. However, they are not definitive. The only way to know for sure if the patient has prostate cancer is to perform a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of tissue is taken from the prostate gland and examined under a microscope.

The patient's probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer. This probability is based on the patient's age, race, PSA level, and DRE findings.

The patient should discuss his options with his doctor. The doctor may recommend a biopsy to determine if the patient has prostate cancer. If the patient does have prostate cancer, the doctor will discuss the treatment options with him.

The remaining choices are incorrect.

A. The patient’s slow rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and enlarged prostate are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and his probability of prostate cancer is less than 10%.

This is incorrect because the patient's PSA level is high, and he has an enlarged prostate. These findings are concerning for prostate cancer, not BPH.

B. The patient’s rise in PSA level means his probability of prostate cancer is more than 50%.

This is incorrect because the patient's probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer.

D. Variability in the patient’s PSA level makes it likely the tests were done in different laboratories.

This is incorrect because the patient's PSA level has been steadily rising over the past few years. This suggests that the tests were not done in different laboratories.

 80%|████████  | 1222/1525 [4:59:39<1:11:03, 14.07s/it]The correct answer is B. Further testing is needed because of the ST depressions during recovery.

ST depressions are a common finding on ECGs, and they can be caused by a variety of things, including coronary artery disease, electrolyte abnormalities, and medications. However, ST depressions that occur during recovery from exercise are more specific for coronary artery disease.

In this case, the patient had no chest pain during exercise, but he did have ST depressions during recovery. This is a concerning finding, and it suggests that the patient may have coronary artery disease. Further testing, such as coronary angiography, is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because the patient did have ST depressions, even though he was asymptomatic and had high exercise capacity.
* Option C is incorrect because ST depressions can be significant even if they are less than 2 mm.
* Option D is incorrect because inferolateral ST depressions are not specific for coronary artery disease in this patient, given his other findings.

Cutaneous diphtheria is a rare, localized form of diphtheria that occurs when the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae infects the skin. It is most common in children, and is often associated with insect bites. The lesions of cutaneous diphtheria are typically small, ulcerated nodules with a grayish membrane over the ulcers. They are often painful and may be accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and lymphangitis.

Cutaneous tuberculosis is a more common infection than cutaneous diphtheria, but it is not usually associated with ulcerated lesions. The lesions of cutaneous tuberculosis are typically papules or nodules that may ulcerate. They are often painless and are not associated with lymphadenopathy or lymphangitis.

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a serious infection caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is most common in immunocompromised patients, and is characterized by large, necrotic ulcers. The lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum are often painful and are associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and lymphangitis.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that is spread by the bite of infected sandflies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis, but cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form. The lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis are typically small, ulcerated nodules with a raised border. They are often painless and are not associated with lymphadenopathy or lymphangitis.

The patient is a 6-month-old girl with multiple polycyclic dark to less dark brown, partly livid shimmering macules, which covered large areas of the back, neck, buttocks, and lower extremities. She also has coarse facial features, hepatomegaly (7 cm below the costal arch), distinctive lumbar kyphosis, and muscular hypotonia compared with her twin brother. Dermoscopy showed faint clouds of nonhomogeneously distributed light brown pigment.

The most likely diagnosis is GM1 gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in the lysosomes of cells throughout the body, including the skin, liver, and brain. The skin lesions in GM1 gangliosidosis are characteristic and are called "cherry red spots." They are caused by the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in the macrophages in the dermis. The coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, and muscular hypotonia are also characteristic of GM1 gangliosidosis.

Morquio syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate sulfatase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of keratan sulfate in the lysosomes of cells throughout the body, including the skin, bones, and eyes. The skin lesions in Morquio syndrome are not characteristic. The patient does not have any of the other features of Morquio syndrome, such as short stature, skeletal dysplasia, and corneal clouding.

Hurler-Scheie syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the lysosomes of cells throughout the body, including the skin, bones, and eyes. The skin lesions in Hurler-Scheie syndrome are not characteristic. The patient does not have any of the other features of Hurler-Scheie syndrome, such as short stature, skeletal dysplasia, and corneal clouding.

Child abuse is a serious problem, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with child abuse.

 80%|████████  | 1226/1525 [5:00:26<1:05:55, 13.23s/it]The correct diagnosis is posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). This is a type of cancer that occurs in people who have had an organ transplant. PTLD is most common in people who have received a kidney transplant, but it can occur after any type of organ transplant.

The most common symptoms of PTLD are fever, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and fatigue. Other symptoms may include weight loss, night sweats, and skin rash. PTLD can also cause problems in the organs that were transplanted.

There are several risk factors for PTLD, including the type of organ transplanted, the type of immunosuppressive drugs used, and the patient's age. People who are younger than 18 years old or older than 60 years old are at increased risk for PTLD.

The diagnosis of PTLD is made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The most common laboratory test used to diagnose PTLD is a blood test to measure the levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies. EBV is a virus that can cause PTLD.

Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, can be used to look for tumors in the organs that were transplanted.

The treatment for PTLD depends on the stage of the disease. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both.

The prognosis for PTLD depends on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. The overall survival rate for PTLD is about 60%.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Central nervous system toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause brain lesions. However, the patient in this case did not have any risk factors for toxoplasmosis, and the imaging studies did not show any evidence of toxoplasmosis.
* Metastatic carcinoma is a type of cancer that spreads from another part of the body to the brain. However, the patient in this case did not have any known cancer, and the imaging studies did not show any evidence of metastatic cancer.
* Central nervous system lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the brain. However, the patient in this case had a history of organ transplantation, which is a risk factor for PTLD. The imaging studies also showed that the patient had multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, which is a characteristic finding of PTLD.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the suprasellar region. This could be a tumor, such as a craniopharyngioma or optic glioma, or an inflammatory process, such as a giant cell arteritis. MR imaging is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for evaluating the brain and spine. It can accurately identify the location, size, and nature of a lesion. This information is essential for planning treatment.

Electrooculography (EOG) and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests are not necessary in this case. EOG measures the electrical activity of the muscles that control eye movement. VEP measures the electrical activity of the brain in response to visual stimulation. These tests can be used to diagnose disorders of the visual system, but they are not helpful in diagnosing a space-occupying lesion.

Blood culture is not necessary in this case. Blood cultures are used to diagnose infections, but there is no evidence of an infection in this patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Perform magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and spine.

The patient has a choroidal granuloma involving the macula. He has a history of latent extrapulmonary tuberculosis that had been treated with antitubercular therapy 1 year earlier. Oral prednisone provided visual improvement. However, the therapy was complicated by avascular hip necrosis that required total hip arthroplasty, and his visual symptoms recurred with corticosteroid tapering.

The patient's visual acuity is 20/150 OD and 20/15 OS. The anterior segment is normal in both eyes. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye revealed a diffuse subretinal yellow mass and an exudative retinal detachment temporal to the fovea. B-scan of the right eye showed a dome-shaped choroidal lesion with an apical height of 3.4 mm and medium to high internal reflectivity. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated heterogeneous leakage, and optical coherence tomography of the macula showed subretinal fluid with irregular retinal and choroidal thickening. Results from extensive workup for infectious and autoimmune etiologies (including serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, and computed tomography of the chest) were negative, except for positive purified protein derivative skin testing and positive interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON-TB Gold; Cellestis, Inc).

The patient's choroidal granuloma is likely due to reactivation of latent tuberculosis. The patient has a history of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and his visual symptoms improved with oral prednisone, a corticosteroid. However, his visual symptoms recurred with corticosteroid tapering, suggesting that he is corticosteroid-intolerant.

The treatment of choroidal granulomas in corticosteroid-intolerant patients is challenging. Oral prednisone is often ineffective, and it can have serious side effects, such as avascular hip necrosis in this patient. Other corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapies, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, can be used, but they can also have serious side effects.

Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate is a safe and effective treatment for choroidal granulomas in corticosteroid-intolerant patients. In this procedure, a small incision is made in the back of the eye (pars plana), and a vitreous cutter is used to remove the vitreous gel from the eye. Intravitreous methotrexate is then injected into the eye. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent that kills the cells in the choroidal granuloma.

Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate is a well-established treatment for choroidal granulomas in corticosteroid-intolerant patients. It has been shown to be effective in improving visual acuity and reducing the size of the choroidal granuloma. The procedure is generally safe and well-tolerated.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Consult infectious diseases for alternative antitubercular therapy) is incorrect because the patient has already been treated with antitubercular therapy. The current choroidal granuloma is likely due to reactivation of latent tuberculosis, not to inadequate treatment of the initial infection.
* Option B (Initiate corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy) is incorrect because the patient is corticosteroid-intolerant. Other corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapies, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, can be used, but they can also have serious side effects.
* Option C (Inject intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide) is incorrect because intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid. The patient is corticosteroid-intolerant, and intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide would likely worsen his condition.

Herpetic whitlow is a common viral infection of the fingers or hands that is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is characterized by a small, painful, fluid-filled blister that usually appears on the tip of the finger. The blister may rupture and form a crust, and it may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). Herpetic whitlow is most commonly spread through contact with the saliva or secretions from an infected person's mouth or genitals.

Cutaneous anthrax is a rare, but serious, bacterial infection that can occur when the skin comes into contact with spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It is characterized by a small, painless, black eschar (scab) at the site of infection. The eschar may be surrounded by a raised, erythematous (red) border. Cutaneous anthrax is most commonly spread through contact with infected animals or animal products.

Orf is a common viral infection of the skin that is caused by a poxvirus called parapoxvirus ovis. It is characterized by a single, raised, crusted papule (bump) on the hands or feet. The papule may be painful and tender, and it may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. Orf is most commonly spread through contact with infected sheep or goats.

Sporotrichosis is a rare, fungal infection that can occur when the skin comes into contact with spores of the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. It is characterized by a small, painless, red papule at the site of infection. The papule may enlarge and ulcerate, and it may be surrounded by a raised, erythematous border. Sporotrichosis is most commonly spread through contact with contaminated soil or wood.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy young girl who presented with a 4-week history of a painless, enlarging lesion on her right thumb. She reported recently injuring her hand on a metal fence at home and biting her nails frequently. She lives on a farm in Ohio and has extensive direct contact with sheep and cows; family pets include a cat, a dog, and a hamster. There was no known recent travel or contact with anyone with a similar lesion. She reported mild tender lymphadenopathy of the right axilla but denied fever.

The clinical presentation is most consistent with orf. Orf is a common infection in people who have contact with sheep or goats, and it is characterized by a single, raised, crusted papule on the hands or feet. The papule may be painful and tender, and it may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy.

The other choices are less likely in this case. Herpetic whitlow is a common viral infection that is spread through contact with the saliva or secretions from an infected person's mouth or genitals. It is characterized by a small, painful, fluid-filled blister that usually appears on the tip of the finger. The blister may rupture and form a crust, and it may be accompanied by lymphadenopathy. However, the patient in this case does not have a history of contact with an infected person, and the lesion is not on the tip of the finger.

Cutaneous anthrax is a rare, but serious, bacterial infection that can occur when the skin comes into contact with spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It is characterized by a small, painless, black eschar (scab) at the site of infection. The eschar may be surrounded by a raised, erythematous (red) border. However, the patient in this case does not have a black eschar.

Sporotrichosis is a rare, fungal infection that can occur when the skin comes into contact with spores of the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. It is characterized by a small, painless, red papule at the site of infection. The papule may enlarge and ulcerate, and it may be surrounded by a raised, erythematous border. However, the patient in this case does not have a history of contact with contaminated soil or wood.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is orf.

 81%|████████  | 1230/1525 [5:01:27<1:14:04, 15.07s/it]The correct answer is C. True vocal fold myxoma.

A true vocal fold polyp is a benign, pedunculated mass that arises from the mucosa of the vocal fold. It is usually caused by chronic vocal abuse, such as shouting or singing. Symptoms include hoarseness, aphonia, and pain. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

Vocal fold squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium of the vocal fold. It is the most common type of cancer of the larynx. Symptoms include hoarseness, aphonia, and pain. Treatment is usually surgical removal, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

Thyroarytenoid muscle rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor that arises from the skeletal muscle of the larynx. It is the most common type of laryngeal rhabdomyoma. Symptoms include hoarseness, aphonia, and pain. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

The patient in the case presented with a 5-month history of sudden-onset, progressively worsening dysphonia, dry cough, and the sensation of a lump in his throat. He described a progressively worsening voice with use to the point where he was nearly aphonic by the end of his workday. He denied any heartburn, hemoptysis, pain, neck masses, or smoking history. Prior treatment with 2 rounds of oral antibiotics and 1 round of oral steroids from his primary care physician did not improve his symptoms. Objectively, the patient’s voice was rough, diplophonic, and very strained. Videostroboscopic examination in the clinic revealed a broad-based submucosal mass in the anterior two-thirds of the right true vocal fold that disrupted vibration of both vocal folds owing to its size and anterior location. Findings from the remainder of his head and neck examination were unremarkable. The patient was taken to the operating room for microdirect laryngoscopy under general anesthesia. A microflap incision along the lateral aspect of the right true vocal fold mass was performed, and a firm, submucosal, tan-colored, seemingly encapsulated, multilobulated mass was removed en bloc with narrow margins and sent for permanent section analysis. The mass was deep to the epithelium of the true vocal fold and superficial to the vocal ligament.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of true vocal fold myxoma. The mass is submucosal, which is a characteristic of myxomas. It is also firm, which is another characteristic of myxomas. The mass is located in the anterior two-thirds of the right true vocal fold, which is a common location for myxomas. The mass disrupted vibration of both vocal folds, which is a common clinical presentation of myxomas. The mass was removed en bloc with narrow margins, which is the standard of care for myxomas. The mass was sent for permanent section analysis, which confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's history and physical examination. A true vocal fold polyp is a pedunculated mass, which the patient's mass was not. Vocal fold squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor, which the patient's mass was not. Thyroarytenoid muscle rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor that arises from the skeletal muscle of the larynx, which the patient's mass was not.

 81%|████████  | 1231/1525 [5:01:44<1:16:07, 15.53s/it]The correct answer is C. Nasal angioleiomyoma.

An angioleiomyoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells. It is the most common type of tumor to occur in the nasal cavity. Angioleiomyomas are typically small, solitary tumors that occur in adults. They are more common in women than in men.

The most common symptom of an angioleiomyoma is epistaxis (nosebleed). Other symptoms may include nasal obstruction, facial pain, and headache. Angioleiomyomas are diagnosed with a biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Angiomyolipoma is a benign tumor that is composed of smooth muscle, fat, and blood vessels. It is most commonly found in the kidney, but it can also occur in the liver, spleen, and other organs. Angiomyolipomas are usually small, but they can grow large and cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and mass effect.

Angiofibroma is a benign tumor that is typically found in young men. It is a vascular tumor that arises from the blood vessels in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. Angiofibromas can grow large and cause symptoms such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, facial pain, and headache.

Hemangioma is a benign tumor that is composed of blood vessels. It is the most common type of tumor in infants and children. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common on the skin, liver, and brain. Hemangiomas usually go away on their own, but they can sometimes cause problems if they grow large or bleed.

In the case of the elderly woman with left-sided acute epistaxis, the most likely diagnosis is a nasal angioleiomyoma. This is supported by the patient's history of new-onset, left-sided acute epistaxis, the clinical evaluation revealing a soft-tissue mass filling the left nasal cavity and based on the mucosal surface of the anterolateral nasal vestibule, the noncontrast paranasal sinus computed tomography showing a 1.2 × 0.8-cm ovoid soft-tissue mass opacifying the posterior aspect of the left nasal vestibule, the endoscopic excision under local anesthesia to remove a broad-based soft-tissue mass from the left nasal vestibule mucosa with a cuff of grossly healthy submucosa, and the tissue specimen biopsy showing a nasal angioleiomyoma.

The other answer choices are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms as well as a nasal angioleiomyoma does. Angiomyolipomas are typically found in the kidney, not the nasal cavity. Angiofibromas are typically found in young men, not elderly women. Hemangiomas are the most common type of tumor in infants and children, not elderly women.

 81%|████████  | 1232/1525 [5:01:59<1:14:46, 15.31s/it]The correct answer is C. Esthesioneuroblastoma.

An inverted papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the mucosa of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. It is the most common type of papilloma in these locations. Inverted papillomas are typically solitary, but they can be multiple. They are more common in men than in women, and they usually occur in adults. The symptoms of an inverted papilloma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may experience nasal obstruction, drainage, or bleeding. Inverted papillomas are usually treated with surgery.

A fungal ball is a mass of fungal hyphae and debris that forms in the sinuses. It is typically caused by an infection with Aspergillus species. Fungal balls are more common in people with chronic sinusitis or immunosuppression. The symptoms of a fungal ball can vary depending on the size and location of the mass. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may experience nasal obstruction, drainage, or headache. Fungal balls are usually treated with antifungal medication.

Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It is the most common type of cancer of the nasal cavity. Esthesioneuroblastomas are typically diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 40. The symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may experience nasal obstruction, drainage, or bleeding. Esthesioneuroblastomas are usually treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the sinonasal mucosa. It is the most common type of undifferentiated carcinoma of the sinonasal tract. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas are typically diagnosed in adults between the ages of 50 and 70. The symptoms of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may experience nasal obstruction, drainage, or bleeding. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas are usually treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The correct answer is C. Esthesioneuroblastoma because the patient's symptoms and the histopathology of the tumor are most consistent with this diagnosis. The patient presented with dizziness, vomiting, unstable gait, and headaches of 2 weeks’ duration. These symptoms are consistent with hyponatremia, which is a known complication of esthesioneuroblastoma. The histopathology of the tumor showed a small, round, blue-cell tumor growing in circumscribed lobules and nests separated by vascularized fibrous stroma. The neoplastic cells had uniform, small, round nuclei with scant cytoplasm. Cells were arranged in a pseudorosette pattern. The nuclei demonstrated dispersed, salt and pepper nuclear chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The cells were surrounded by a neurofibrillary matrix. There were prominent microcalcifications. No mitotic figures were seen. The tumor cells were diffusely positive for immunohistochemical marker synaptophysin. Results from cytokeratin staining were negative. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma.

 81%|████████  | 1233/1525 [5:02:15<1:16:18, 15.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Tuberculous lymphadenitis.

The patient is a woman in her 60s who presents with a 3-week history of enlarging and painful cervical masses. She has a distant history of breast cancer and a recent history of an oral cavity lesion, which was not biopsied or followed up. She does not have any known tuberculosis exposure, recent foreign travel, exposure to unpasteurized food, history of immunodeficiency, or alcohol or tobacco use. She does not have fever, chills, cough, dysphagia, or odynophagia.

Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing woman with normal vital signs. She is found to have bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, which includes fixed and bulky nodes in level IB and IIA and nontender level IV and V nodes. An oral cavity examination reveals no evidence of masses or lesions, floor of mouth and base of tongue are soft, and the palatine tonsils have no lesions or ulcers. Flexible laryngoscopy reveals no evidence of pharyngeal or laryngeal lesions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans of the neck (Figure) revealed bilateral lymphadenopathy with central necrosis.

The differential diagnosis for cervical lymphadenopathy includes a variety of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and autoimmune conditions. In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is tuberculous lymphadenitis. This is supported by the patient's age, history of breast cancer, recent history of an oral cavity lesion, and the presence of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with central necrosis. The CT scan findings are also consistent with tuberculous lymphadenitis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis in this patient. This is because the patient does not have any risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The patient also does not have any symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma, such as a mass in the oral cavity, hoarseness, or dysphagia.

Lymphoma is a less likely diagnosis in this patient. This is because the patient does not have any risk factors for lymphoma, such as a family history of lymphoma or an autoimmune disease. The patient also does not have any symptoms of lymphoma, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis in this patient. This is because the patient does not have any risk factors for papillary thyroid carcinoma, such as a family history of thyroid cancer or exposure to radiation. The patient also does not have any symptoms of papillary thyroid carcinoma, such as a mass in the neck, hoarseness, or dysphagia.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is tuberculous lymphadenitis. The patient should be evaluated by a physician for further management.

 81%|████████  | 1234/1525 [5:02:32<1:17:02, 15.89s/it]The correct answer is B. Aberrant internal carotid artery.

An aberrant internal carotid artery (AICA) is a congenital anomaly in which the internal carotid artery takes an abnormal course, usually through the retropharyngeal space. This can result in a pulsatile mass in the oropharynx, as was seen in this patient.

AVMs of the oropharynx are rare and are typically diagnosed in children. They are characterized by a tangle of abnormal blood vessels that can bleed and cause symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and facial pain.

Cavernous hemangiomas of the oropharynx are also rare and are typically diagnosed in adults. They are benign tumors that are made up of blood-filled spaces. They can cause symptoms such as a mass in the oropharynx, pain, and bleeding.

Internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms are rare and are typically caused by trauma or infection. They are characterized by a sac-like bulge in the wall of the internal carotid artery that can rupture and cause bleeding.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of AICA. The patient's history of dry cough, foreign body sensation in the throat, and mild dysphagia are all consistent with a mass in the oropharynx. The patient's physical examination revealed a submucosal pulsatile mass in the right retropharyngeal area. The patient's imaging findings, including head and neck magnetic resonance angiography, showed an abnormal medial course of the right internal carotid artery. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of AICA.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. AVMs of the oropharynx are typically diagnosed in children and are characterized by a tangle of abnormal blood vessels that can bleed and cause symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and facial pain. Cavernous hemangiomas of the oropharynx are also rare and are typically diagnosed in adults. They are benign tumors that are made up of blood-filled spaces.

 81%|████████  | 1235/1525 [5:02:41<1:07:15, 13.92s/it]The correct answer is C. Hypophysitis.

The patient presented with headaches, fatigue, poor appetite, intermittent nausea, and a mild rash. These symptoms are consistent with hypophysitis, an inflammation of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small gland located at the base of the brain that produces hormones that control many important bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

The patient's laboratory tests showed low levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, corticotropin, and testosterone. These low levels are consistent with hypophysitis, as the pituitary gland is responsible for producing these hormones.

The patient's MRI showed a mass in the pituitary gland. This mass is consistent with hypophysitis, as inflammation of the pituitary gland can cause it to enlarge.

The patient's history of melanoma and his treatment with ipilimumab are also consistent with hypophysitis. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that is used to treat melanoma. It works by blocking the activity of a protein called CTLA-4. CTLA-4 is a protein that helps to regulate the immune system. When CTLA-4 is blocked, the immune system can become overactive and attack healthy cells. This can lead to inflammation of the pituitary gland and other organs.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

* Neurosarcoid is a rare disease that causes inflammation of the nervous system. It is not typically associated with headaches, fatigue, poor appetite, intermittent nausea, or a mild rash.
* Melanoma metastasis is the spread of melanoma to other parts of the body. It is not typically associated with headaches, fatigue, poor appetite, intermittent nausea, or a mild rash.
* Pituitary macroadenoma is a large tumor that grows on the pituitary gland. It is not typically associated with headaches, fatigue, poor appetite, intermittent nausea, or a mild rash.

 81%|████████  | 1236/1525 [5:02:58<1:11:51, 14.92s/it]The correct answer is C. Anal adenocarcinoma.

Anal adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the anus. It is the most common type of cancer of the anus.

The most common symptom of anal adenocarcinoma is a lump or mass in the anus. The lump may be painful or bleed. Other symptoms may include itching, burning, and discharge from the anus.

The risk of developing anal adenocarcinoma is increased in people who are infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause genital warts.

There is no screening test for anal adenocarcinoma. However, people who are at high risk for the disease may be advised to have regular exams by a doctor.

The treatment for anal adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.

The prognosis for people with anal adenocarcinoma is generally good. The five-year survival rate for people with early-stage anal adenocarcinoma is over 90%.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not match the patient's presentation.

A giant perianal abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the perianal area. It is caused by an infection of the glands in the anus. The symptoms of a giant perianal abscess include pain, swelling, and redness in the perianal area. Treatment for a giant perianal abscess usually involves incision and drainage of the abscess.

A giant condyloma is a large growth that forms on the skin around the anus. It is caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). The symptoms of a giant condyloma include a large, cauliflower-like growth on the skin around the anus. Treatment for a giant condyloma usually involves removal of the growth.

Anal squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the anus. It is the second most common type of cancer of the anus.

The most common symptom of anal squamous cell carcinoma is a lump or mass in the anus. The lump may be painful or bleed. Other symptoms may include itching, burning, and discharge from the anus.

The risk of developing anal squamous cell carcinoma is increased in people who are infected with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause genital warts.

There is no screening test for anal squamous cell carcinoma. However, people who are at high risk for the disease may be advised to have regular exams by a doctor.

The treatment for anal squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.

 81%|████████  | 1237/1525 [5:03:15<1:13:35, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is D. Gossypiboma.

Gossypiboma is a foreign body that is composed of cotton fibers. It is most commonly found in the abdomen, but it can also be found in other parts of the body. Gossypiboma is most often caused by a surgical error, such as when a piece of gauze is left inside the body during surgery.

The symptoms of gossypiboma can vary depending on the size and location of the foreign body. Some people with gossypiboma may not have any symptoms, while others may experience pain, fever, and swelling. Gossypiboma can also cause complications, such as infection, abscess formation, and bowel obstruction.

The diagnosis of gossypiboma is made with imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment of gossypiboma is surgical removal of the foreign body.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most likely cause of a hepatic mass in a woman in her 40s.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the liver cells. It is the most common type of liver cancer. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma increases with age, obesity, alcohol use, and chronic liver disease.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare type of liver cancer that occurs in young people. It is not associated with any known risk factors.

Hepatic metastasis is a type of cancer that spreads to the liver from another part of the body. The most common types of cancer that metastasize to the liver are colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

The patient in the case does not have any of the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma or fibrolamellar carcinoma. The patient's history of a splenectomy and hepatic biopsy nine years ago suggests that the hepatic mass may be a gossypiboma.

 81%|████████  | 1238/1525 [5:03:31<1:14:40, 15.61s/it]The correct answer is B. Discontinue pantoprazole.

The patient has a widespread scaly rash, which is a common side effect of pantoprazole. In addition, the patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, which is a condition that can be exacerbated by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like pantoprazole. Therefore, it is best to discontinue pantoprazole to see if the rash improves.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate progression of sarcoidosis is incorrect because the patient has already been diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis and there is no evidence that the sarcoidosis is progressing.
* Option C: Start oral prednisone is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is a condition that is often treated with prednisone.
* Option D: Order testing for anti–Mi-2 and anti–Jo-1 antibodies is incorrect because these antibodies are not associated with the patient's rash.

 81%|████████  | 1239/1525 [5:03:46<1:13:45, 15.47s/it]The correct answer is A. The patient has hyperprolactinemia due to a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma.

The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, vision loss, and low libido are consistent with hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia is a condition in which the blood level of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, is too high. Prolactin can cause a variety of symptoms, including menstrual irregularities, infertility, impotence, and loss of libido.

In men, hyperprolactinemia can also cause gynecomastia, or the development of breasts. The patient does not report any of these symptoms, which makes it less likely that his hyperprolactinemia is due to a prolactinoma, a tumor of the pituitary gland that produces prolactin.

The patient's examination was significant for the presence of bitemporal visual field defects on confrontation testing. This finding is consistent with a pituitary adenoma, which can compress the optic chiasm, the structure that carries visual information from the eyes to the brain.

The patient's laboratory tests revealed low serum testosterone and thyrotropin and elevated serum prolactin levels. These findings are consistent with hyperprolactinemia.

A neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed the presence of symmetric superior temporal visual field defects on perimetry. This finding is also consistent with a pituitary adenoma.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained to examine the patient's brain. The MRI showed a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. A nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma is a tumor of the pituitary gland that does not produce any hormones.

The patient's symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory tests are consistent with hyperprolactinemia due to a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. The patient's MRI showed a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, which is the most likely cause of his hyperprolactinemia.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory tests.

B. The patient has hyperprolactinemia due to thyroid disease. Hyperprolactinemia can be caused by a variety of conditions, including thyroid disease. However, the patient's thyroid function tests were normal, which makes it less likely that his hyperprolactinemia is due to thyroid disease.

C. The patient has sertraline-induced hyperprolactinemia. Sertraline, a medication used to treat anxiety and depression, can cause hyperprolactinemia. However, the patient has been taking sertraline for several years without any problems. It is unlikely that his recent onset of hyperprolactinemia is due to sertraline.

D. The patient has hyperprolactinemia due to a prolactinoma. A prolactinoma is a tumor of the pituitary gland that produces prolactin. However, the patient's MRI showed a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, which is not a prolactinoma.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, gastric ulcers, celiac artery occlusion, and transient ischemic attacks. She is currently taking metformin, lansoprazole, venlafaxine, diltiazem, atorvastatin, oxycodone/acetaminophen, ramopril, reglan, zolpidem, and clopidogrel. She presented with a painful rash on her flank of 2 days’ duration. She denied any history of trauma and had not applied anything topically in this area of skin. She denied fevers, systemic symptoms, joint pain, and skin thickening.

The physical examination revealed an 8-cm solitary, erythematous plaque with vesiculation and central erosion on the right lateral area of her abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. A punch biopsy showed a vacuolar interface dermatitis pattern, but a definitive clinical diagnosis was not established. She was treated with clobetasol cream (0.05%), and the plaque resolved in 4 weeks with postinflammatory hypopigmentation.

Ten months later, the patient developed a tender, pink, indurated 7-cm plaque with telangiectasias and central ulceration in the same location, with no other cutaneous findings. No precipitating factors could be identified. A punch biopsy showed minimal inflammation, atrophy and hyperkeratosis of the epidermis, and edema, sclerosis, and absence of hair follicles in the dermis.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of conditions, including:

* Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus
* Morphea
* Linear scleroderma
* Scleromyxedema
* Panniculitis
* Vasculitis
* Contact dermatitis
* Drug eruption

In order to narrow down the differential diagnosis and make a definitive diagnosis, it is important to obtain a detailed procedural history. This includes information about the patient's medical history, medications, allergies, and any recent procedures or exposures. It is also important to ask about the patient's social history, including smoking, alcohol use, and sexual history.

A detailed procedural history can provide valuable information about the patient's condition. For example, a history of recent surgery may suggest a diagnosis of contact dermatitis, while a history of recent travel may suggest a diagnosis of drug eruption. A detailed procedural history can also help to identify potential triggers for the patient's condition. For example, a history of recent exposure to a new medication may suggest a diagnosis of drug eruption, while a history of recent exposure to a new food may suggest a diagnosis of contact dermatitis.

In the case of this patient, a detailed procedural history would help to identify potential triggers for the patient's condition. This information would be helpful in narrowing down the differential diagnosis and making a definitive diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not provide the necessary information to make a definitive diagnosis. Ordering laboratory studies for antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies may be helpful in diagnosing certain autoimmune conditions, but these tests are not specific for the patient's condition. Performing patch testing for a possible contact allergen may be helpful in diagnosing contact dermatitis, but this test is not specific for the patient's condition. Obtaining a skin swab for varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody level may be helpful in diagnosing varicella zoster virus infection, but this test is not specific for the patient's condition.

* The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease, which is a risk factor for septic emboli.
* The patient developed severe, unremitting left ankle pain with purpuric lesions on the skin. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of septic emboli.
* The patient's laboratory findings were significant for neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis. This is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including septic emboli.
* The patient's physical examination revealed multiple stellate, purpuric plaques with central flaccid bullae on the medial and lateral aspects of the left ankle. This is a characteristic finding of septic emboli.
* The patient's punch biopsy specimens showed partially necrotic epidermis with intraepidermal bulla formation with marked perivascular infiltrates in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. This is a histopathological finding that is consistent with septic emboli.
* The patient's transesophageal echocardiography showed vegetations on the aortic valve. This is a finding that is consistent with infective endocarditis, which is a common cause of septic emboli.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening condition that is characterized by calcification of small blood vessels in the skin. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic kidney disease. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with calciphylaxis.
* Vasculitis is a condition that is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. There are many different types of vasculitis, and the clinical presentation can vary depending on the type of vasculitis. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with any of the known types of vasculitis.

It is characterized by the development of small, flat, violaceous papules on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, hands, and arms. The papules may be pruritic (itchy) and may sometimes coalesce to form larger plaques.

The diagnosis of lichen planus actinicus is based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen from a lesion of lichen planus actinicus reveals a characteristic lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction.

There is no cure for lichen planus actinicus, but the condition can be managed with topical corticosteroids and sun protection. In some cases, systemic medications may also be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient in the case. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune skin condition that is characterized by the development of scaly, erythematous plaques on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Erythema dyschromicum perstans is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by the development of hyperpigmented macules on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Polymorphous light eruption is a photodermatosis (skin condition caused by exposure to sunlight) that is characterized by the development of papules, plaques, and vesicles on sun-exposed areas of the skin.

 82%|████████▏ | 1243/1525 [5:04:45<1:11:37, 15.24s/it]The correct answer is pemphigus erythematosus.

Pemphigus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters to form on the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the presence of circulating antibodies to the desmoglein 1 and 3 proteins, which are found in the cell junctions of the skin and mucous membranes. These antibodies cause the cells to detach from each other, resulting in the formation of blisters.

The patient in the case presented with a 6-month history of pruritic, pink scaling plaques on her face and neck. The lesions subsequently involved her chest, abdomen, and back and flared with sun exposure. A diagnosis of lupus erythematosus (LE) was favored, but the lesions failed to improve on a regimen that included hydroxychloroquine sulfate, fluocinonide ointment, 0.05%, and tacrolimus ointment, 0.1%. Biopsy samples were obtained for histopathologic evaluation.

The histopathologic findings were consistent with pemphigus erythematosus. The biopsy specimens showed subepidermal blisters with acantholysis, which is the loss of cohesion between the epidermal cells. The presence of acantholysis is characteristic of pemphigus erythematosus.

The laboratory findings were also consistent with pemphigus erythematosus. The patient had positive antinuclear antibody titers at 1:640. Antinuclear antibodies are antibodies that are directed against components of the nucleus of the cell. They are found in the blood of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including pemphigus erythematosus.

The patient also had lymphopenia and normocytic anemia. Lymphopenia is a decrease in the number of lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune system. Anemia is a condition in which the blood has a decreased number of red blood cells. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues of the body.

The patient's urinalysis results were within normal limits. Urinalysis is a test that is used to evaluate the urine. It can be used to detect the presence of blood, protein, glucose, or other abnormalities in the urine.

The patient's clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and laboratory findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Pemphigus erythematosus.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of circulating antibodies to the nuclear antigens, such as anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies. The patient in the case did not have any of the systemic manifestations of lupus erythematosus, and her laboratory findings were not consistent with lupus erythematosus.
* Eczematous dermatitis is a common skin condition that is characterized by itching, redness, and inflammation. It is not an autoimmune disease. The patient in the case had a history of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, which are risk factors for autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is more likely that the patient's skin condition is secondary to an autoimmune disease, such as pemphigus erythematosus.
* Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters to form on the skin. It is characterized by the presence of circulating antibodies to the desmoglein 1 protein. The patient in the case did not have any of the typical findings of pemphigus foliaceus, such as large blisters on the scalp and face.

 82%|████████▏ | 1244/1525 [5:05:02<1:12:52, 15.56s/it]The correct answer is C. Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G.

The patient has a history of HIV infection and is currently receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. He presented with a 5-day history of bilateral redness, blurred vision, and photophobia. On examination, he had bilateral vitritis, hyperemic optic nerves, and extensive whitening likely involving all layers of the retina. He was started on intravenous acyclovir sodium and prednisone. After 48 hours of treatment, his condition did not improve.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV infection. It is caused by the cytomegalovirus virus, which is a member of the herpesvirus family. CMV retinitis can cause inflammation, necrosis, and scarring of the retina. If left untreated, it can lead to blindness.

The treatment for CMV retinitis is with antiviral medications, such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. These medications can be given intravenously or orally. In some cases, a combination of medications may be needed.

In addition to antiviral medications, corticosteroids may also be used to treat CMV retinitis. Corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and swelling. They can also help to protect the optic nerve from damage.

In this patient, the treatment with intravenous acyclovir sodium and prednisone has not been effective. The next step in the management of this patient is to check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G.

The laboratory results should be checked to rule out other possible causes of the patient's retinal inflammation, such as toxoplasmosis, varicella zoster virus, and syphilis. If these other causes are ruled out, then the patient should be started on IV penicillin G. Penicillin G is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacteria, including the bacteria that cause CMV retinitis.

The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of optic nerve damage. If the optic nerve is damaged, the patient may lose vision in the affected eye.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for CMV retinitis in this patient.

Choice A, continue the same treatment, is incorrect because the treatment with intravenous acyclovir sodium and prednisone has not been effective.

Choice B, increase the dose of the corticosteroids, is incorrect because the patient is already receiving a high dose of corticosteroids. Increasing the dose of corticosteroids could increase the risk of side effects, such as high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and cataracts.

Choice D, vitreous tap/biopsy, is incorrect because it is not necessary in this patient. The diagnosis of CMV retinitis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results. A vitreous tap/biopsy is only necessary if the diagnosis is uncertain or if the patient does not respond to treatment.

The patient has a history of epilepsy, which is a risk factor for stroke. The patient also has new-onset vision loss and paresthesias in the left arm and leg, which could be signs of a stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is the most sensitive test for detecting stroke. It can show the location and extent of the stroke, as well as any other abnormalities in the brain. If a stroke is detected, treatment can be started immediately to improve the patient's chances of recovery.

A. Initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of an inflammatory condition. Corticosteroid therapy is not indicated for the treatment of stroke.

C. Perform a retinal biopsy is incorrect because the patient's vision loss is not due to a retinal disease. A retinal biopsy is a surgical procedure that is used to diagnose and treat retinal diseases. It is not indicated for the treatment of stroke.

D. Obtain computed tomography of the chest is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of a pulmonary embolism. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is a diagnostic test that is used to detect pulmonary embolisms. It is not indicated for the treatment of stroke.

 82%|████████▏ | 1246/1525 [5:05:29<1:07:48, 14.58s/it]The correct diagnosis is B. Ehrlichiosis.

Adenovirus is a common virus that can cause a variety of respiratory illnesses, including the common cold, pharyngitis, and pneumonia. It can also cause conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and rash. However, adenovirus is not typically associated with fever, abdominal pain, or a rash that spares the palms and soles.

Epstein-Barr virus is a herpesvirus that can cause infectious mononucleosis. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can include fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and rash. However, infectious mononucleosis is not typically associated with abdominal pain.

Parvovirus B19 is a virus that can cause a variety of illnesses, including fifth disease (erythema infectiosum). Fifth disease is characterized by a characteristic "slapped cheek" rash that typically spares the palms and soles. However, parvovirus B19 is not typically associated with fever, abdominal pain, or leukopenia.

Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne illness caused by infection with Ehrlichia species. The most common form of ehrlichiosis in the United States is human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), which is caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Symptoms of HME can include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and rash. In some cases, HME can also cause more serious complications, such as pneumonia, meningitis, or coagulopathy.

The patient in the case presented with fever, abdominal pain, rash, and leukopenia. The rash was described as blanching, erythematous, and macular on the cheeks and intermittent, erythematous, and reticular on the chest, abdomen, arms, and legs. These findings are consistent with HME. The patient also had a history of tick exposure, which is a risk factor for HME.

The diagnosis of HME can be confirmed with serologic testing. Treatment for HME is with antibiotics. The patient in the case was treated with doxycycline and made a full recovery.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is B. Ehrlichiosis. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

 82%|████████▏ | 1247/1525 [5:05:45<1:10:24, 15.20s/it]The correct answer is B. Peripheral ossifying fibroma.

Parosteal osteosarcoma is a rare, malignant bone tumor that arises from the parosteal surface of a bone. It is most common in the long bones of the lower extremities, but can also occur in the mandible. Parosteal osteosarcoma is characterized by a lobulated, soft tissue mass that is attached to the surface of the bone. The mass is usually well-demarcated and may be calcified. On imaging, parosteal osteosarcoma appears as a lobulated, soft tissue mass with areas of calcification and ossification. The mass may be associated with cortical erosion or destruction.

Periosteal osteosarcoma is a rare, malignant bone tumor that arises from the periosteum, the membrane that covers the surface of a bone. It is most common in the long bones of the lower extremities, but can also occur in the mandible. Periosteal osteosarcoma is characterized by a spindle cell proliferation that is associated with areas of ossification. The tumor is usually well-demarcated and may be attached to the surface of the bone by a stalk. On imaging, periosteal osteosarcoma appears as a lobulated, soft tissue mass with areas of calcification and ossification. The mass may be associated with cortical erosion or destruction.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare, aggressive form of carcinoma that has features of both carcinoma and sarcoma. It is most common in the lung, but can also occur in other organs, including the breast, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Sarcomatoid carcinoma is characterized by a spindle cell proliferation that is associated with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor is usually poorly-demarcated and may invade adjacent structures. On imaging, sarcomatoid carcinoma appears as a large, heterogeneous mass with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The mass may be associated with cortical destruction.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 60s with a large, left-sided, progressively enlarging mandibular mass. She has no pain or neurosensory disturbances related to the lesion; however, she does have difficulty tolerating a regular diet owing to the bulk of the mass. She has no significant medical history, had quit smoking cigarettes 4 year prior to presentation, but had a 20 pack-year smoking history. Findings from the physical examination were notable for a 4.9-cm exophytic, nodular, slightly mobile mass of the left lower posterior alveolar ridge, involving the buccal and lingual gingiva. Teeth 20 to 24 were mobile. She had no cervical lymphadenopathy. Previous biopsy demonstrated squamous mucosa with ulceration and chronic inflammation. Contrasted computed tomography revealed an exophytic complex mass with areas of calcification and ossification inferiorly and a necrotic, cystic irregularly enhancing portion superiorly. An additional biopsy was performed. The mass was excised, and teeth 20 to 26 were removed. The alveolar ridge was recontoured, and the incision was closed primarily.

The histopathologic image of the biopsy specimen shows a proliferation of spindle cells with areas of calcification and ossification. The tumor is well-demarcated and does not invade adjacent structures. This is consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral ossifying fibroma.

Parosteal osteosarcoma and periosteal osteosarcoma are both malignant bone tumors that can arise from the mandible. However, these tumors are characterized by a spindle cell proliferation that is associated with areas of ossification. The tumor is usually well-demarcated and may be attached to the surface of the bone by a stalk. On imaging, parosteal osteosarcoma and periosteal osteosarcoma appear as a lobulated, soft tissue mass with areas of calcification and ossification. The mass may be associated with cortical erosion or destruction. In contrast, peripheral ossifying fibroma is a benign bone tumor that arises from the periosteum. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells with areas of calcification and ossification. The tumor is well-demarcated and does not invade adjacent structures. On imaging, peripheral ossifying fibroma appears as a well-defined, lobulated mass with areas of calcification and ossification.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare, aggressive form of carcinoma that has features of both carcinoma and sarcoma. It is most common in the lung, but can also occur in other organs, including the breast, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Sarcomatoid carcinoma is characterized by a spindle cell proliferation that is associated with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor is usually poorly-demarcated and may invade adjacent structures. On imaging, sarcomatoid carcinoma appears as a large, heterogeneous mass with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The mass may be associated with cortical destruction. In the case presented, the patient does not have any of the features of sarcomatoid carcinoma.

 82%|████████▏ | 1248/1525 [5:06:02<1:12:26, 15.69s/it]The correct answer is B. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer of the tongue, but it does not form glandular structures. Acinic cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are both types of salivary gland tumors, but they do not typically occur in the tongue. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in any glandular tissue, including the tongue. It is characterized by the presence of both squamous cells and glandular cells.

The patient in the case presented with a 4-year history of intermittent left-sided throat pain, which eventually progressed to left ear pain approximately 1 year prior to her presentation. This is consistent with the symptoms of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing.

The patient's history of no significant medical history and no significant use of tobacco or alcohol is also consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which is more common in people who smoke or drink alcohol.

The otoscopic examination was unremarkable and the nasopharyngoscopy failed to reveal any masses, ulcerations, or mucosal lesions. This is also consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which is typically a submucosal tumor that does not cause any visible changes to the surface of the tongue.

The MRI revealed an enhancing 1 × 6-mm lesion in the left side of the posterolateral tongue base. This is consistent with the typical appearance of mucoepidermoid carcinoma on MRI.

The biopsy of the mass revealed an intermediate-grade infiltrating neoplasm forming solid sheets and glandular structures. This is also consistent with the histopathologic features of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

The tumor cells stained positive for CK7 and p63, and negative for CK20, p16, and S-100 by immunohistochemical analysis. This is also consistent with the immunophenotype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

Stain for mucicarmine was positive in glandular areas. This is a specific stain for mucin, which is a substance that is produced by glandular cells. The presence of mucicarmine staining in the tumor cells is further evidence that the tumor is a mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

After establishing the diagnosis, the patient was taken to the operating room for a left base of tongue resection via suprahyoid approach along with a left-sided neck dissection of levels I to IV. The tumor was removed with negative margins, and no positive cervical lymph nodes were found on final pathologic analysis.

This is the standard treatment for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The goal of treatment is to remove the tumor completely with negative margins. If the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes, they will also be removed.

The patient's prognosis is good. The overall 5-year survival rate for mucoepidermoid carcinoma is 80%. The prognosis is even better for patients with low-grade tumors and tumors that are confined to the tongue.

 82%|████████▏ | 1249/1525 [5:06:19<1:13:12, 15.92s/it]The correct answer is D. Invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis.

The patient in the case presented with a rapid progression of necrotic lesion of the mandibular gingiva. She was pancytopenic, which means she had a low white blood cell count. This made her more susceptible to infection. The initial chemotherapy regimen failed, requiring a more aggressive regimen, which left her pancytopenic. During the course of the second chemotherapy treatment, she developed left-sided mandibular pain. A computed tomographic scan revealed cellulitic changes along the buccal cortex of the mandible and a small 2 × 12-mm abscess formation. At initial evaluation by the otolaryngology service on hospital day 32, she had decreased sensation at the left mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and ecchymoses along the mandibular buccal-gingival borders bilaterally with induration of the left floor of mouth and buccal mucosa. She continued to receive broad spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal coverage. By hospital day 38, the patient had developed evidence of ischemia and necrosis along the gingival and lingual aspects of the left mandibular alveolar ridge, extending past midline to involve mucosa on the right side. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 7 × 10 × 35-mm abscess involving both gingival and lingual aspects of the left anterior mandible. Biopsy specimens of the right mandibular gingiva showed fungal hyphae.

The most likely diagnosis is invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis. This is a serious infection that can be fatal if not treated promptly. It is most common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer or HIV/AIDS. The infection is caused by fungi that are normally found in the mouth, but can become pathogenic when the immune system is weakened. The symptoms of invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis include fever, chills, pain in the mouth, and a foul-smelling discharge from the gums. The infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs and brain.

The treatment for invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis is antifungal medication. The patient in the case presented was treated with intravenous amphotericin B, which is a powerful antifungal medication. She also received supportive care, such as fluids and nutrition. The patient responded well to treatment and was discharged from the hospital after 10 days.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Viral infection: The patient did not have any symptoms of a viral infection, such as fever, rash, or sore throat.
* Malignant neoplasm: The patient did not have any symptoms of a malignant neoplasm, such as a lump or mass in the mouth.
* Pemphigus vulgaris: Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that causes blisters in the skin and mucous membranes. The patient did not have any blisters in her mouth.

A. Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma is an aggressive malignant tumor that typically arises from the cartilage of the ribs, sternum, or spine. It is rare to occur in the carotid space. The CT scan in the case shows a solid mass with a few cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within, which is not typical of extraskeletal chondrosarcoma. Additionally, extraskeletal chondrosarcoma typically shows intense postcontrast enhancement, which is not seen in the case.

B. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a rare malignant tumor that can arise from any soft tissue. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in adults. The CT scan in the case shows a solid mass with a few cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within, which is not typical of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Additionally, malignant fibrous histiocytoma typically shows heterogeneous postcontrast enhancement, which is not seen in the case.

D. Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that typically arises from the synovial lining of joints. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. The CT scan in the case shows a solid mass with a few cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within, which is not typical of synovial sarcoma. Additionally, synovial sarcoma typically shows homogeneous postcontrast enhancement, which is not seen in the case.

Ancient schwannoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. It is typically seen in older adults, and it is more common in men than women. The CT scan in the case shows a solid mass with a few cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within, which is typical of ancient schwannoma. Additionally, ancient schwannoma typically shows heterogeneous postcontrast enhancement, which is seen in the case.

Endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare, sight-threatening infection of the eye that occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream and travel to the eye. It is most commonly seen in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, or HIV/AIDS. The patient in this case does not have any of these underlying conditions, making endogenous endophthalmitis less likely.

HLA-B27 uveitis is a type of uveitis that occurs in people who have the HLA-B27 gene. It is a chronic condition that can cause inflammation in the eye, leading to pain, redness, and blurred vision. The patient in this case does not have the HLA-B27 gene, making HLA-B27 uveitis less likely.

Herpes simplex uveitis is a type of uveitis that is caused by the herpes simplex virus. It is a common condition that can cause inflammation in the eye, leading to pain, redness, and blurred vision. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of herpes simplex, making herpes simplex uveitis less likely.

Leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. It can cause the production of abnormal white blood cells, which can then travel to the eye and cause inflammation. The patient in this case has a history of leukemia, and the symptoms of his eye disease are consistent with leukemia relapse. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leukemia relapse.

A choledochal cyst is a congenital anomaly of the bile duct. It is a cystic dilatation of the common bile duct, which is the duct that carries bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. Choledochal cysts are often associated with gallstones, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.

A long common biliopancreatic channel is a condition in which the common bile duct and pancreatic duct join together for a longer than normal distance. This can cause problems with the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, and can lead to gallstones, pancreatitis, and cholangitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the findings of the intraoperative cholangiogram. A choledochoduodenal fistula is a connection between the common bile duct and the duodenum. A biloma is a collection of bile that is not draining properly. Gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct is a condition in which there are two gallbladders, each with its own cystic duct.

The intraoperative cholangiogram showed an unusual anatomical variant, which was a double lumen at the distal CBD. This finding is consistent with a choledochal cyst. The transcystic choledochoscopy also showed multiple gallstones within a dilated region of cystic duct. This finding is consistent with a long common biliopancreatic channel.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D. Choledochal cyst and long common biliopancreatic channel.

A mycotic aneurysm is an infection of the wall of an artery, usually caused by bacteria. It is most commonly seen in people with intravenous drug use, but it can also occur in people with other medical conditions, such as cancer or immune system disorders. The patient in the case does not have any of these risk factors, and there is no evidence of infection in the blood or urine cultures. Therefore, a mycotic aneurysm is not the most likely diagnosis.

A pseudoaneurysm is a false aneurysm, which is a bulge in an artery that is caused by a tear in the wall of the artery. It is usually caused by trauma, but it can also occur in people with certain medical conditions, such as atherosclerosis. The patient in the case does not have any risk factors for a pseudoaneurysm, and there is no evidence of trauma or other medical conditions that could have caused it. Therefore, a pseudoaneurysm is not the most likely diagnosis.

Infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis is a rare condition that occurs when inflammation of the intestines (diverticulitis) spreads to the aorta, the main artery in the abdomen. It is most commonly seen in older adults, and it is often associated with other medical conditions, such as atherosclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient in the case does not have any risk factors for infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis, and there is no evidence of diverticulitis or other medical conditions that could have caused it. Therefore, infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis is not the most likely diagnosis.

The most likely diagnosis is inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a condition in which the wall of the aorta becomes inflamed, causing it to weaken and bulge. It is most commonly seen in older adults, and it is often associated with other medical conditions, such as atherosclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient in the case has several risk factors for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm, including his age, the presence of other medical conditions, and the absence of other more likely diagnoses. The CT scan also shows asymmetric attenuation surrounding the infrarenal aorta, which is a characteristic finding of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient's history of uterine cancer and breast cancer, as well as the presence of a growing, painful scar on the abdomen, are concerning for cutaneous angiosarcoma. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that most commonly affects people who have had radiation therapy to the chest or abdomen. It is characterized by a rapidly growing, purplish or red skin lesion that may ulcerate.

The most important diagnostic test for cutaneous angiosarcoma is a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy involves removing a small piece of tissue from the lesion and examining it under a microscope. This can help to determine the type of cancer and the stage of the disease.

Treatment for cutaneous angiosarcoma typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The goal of treatment is to remove the cancer as completely as possible and to prevent the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Obtaining bacterial and mycobacterial cultures of the ulcerated area and pursuing treatment with a longer course of antibiotics would be appropriate if the patient had a bacterial or mycobacterial infection. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an infection.
* Obtaining a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen would be appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs that suggest that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. However, the patient does not have any symptoms or signs that suggest that the cancer has spread.
* Checking the patient's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status would be appropriate if the patient had risk factors for HIV infection. However, the patient does not have any risk factors for HIV infection.

 82%|████████▏ | 1255/1525 [5:07:53<1:10:02, 15.56s/it]The elevated platelet count most likely resulted from a transient and not reproducible finding. This is because the patient has no other symptoms or signs of a myeloproliferative disorder, such as splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or bone marrow fibrosis. Additionally, the platelet count is only slightly elevated, which is more consistent with a transient finding than a chronic disorder.

The elevated platelet count could also be caused by stress of migraine attacks, but this is less likely given that the patient has been experiencing headaches for 3 years without any other symptoms. Additionally, stress-induced thrombocytosis is typically a transient finding that resolves once the stressor is removed.

Myelodysplastic syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the bone marrow and can cause an elevated platelet count. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the other symptoms of myelodysplastic syndrome, such as anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Additionally, myelodysplastic syndrome is typically a chronic disorder, which is not consistent with the patient's history.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the elevated platelet count in this case is that it is a transient and not reproducible finding.

Trichomycosis axillaris is a fungal infection of the underarm hair that is caused by the yeast Corynebacterium tenuis. It is characterized by the formation of creamy yellow concretions along the hair shafts. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may cause itching or a strong axillary odor.

The diagnosis of trichomycosis axillaris is made by direct microscopic examination of the hair shafts. The concretions will appear as round, basophilic structures that are attached to the hair shaft. The lesions can also be cultured to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of trichomycosis axillaris is with antifungal medications, such as miconazole or clotrimazole. The lesions will usually resolve within a few weeks of treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Artifactual peripilar hair casts are not caused by a fungus. They are caused by the deposition of keratin and other proteins around the hair shaft.
* Pediculosis axillaris is an infection of the underarm hair that is caused by the human head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis. The lesions are characterized by the presence of small, white lice and their eggs (nits) on the hair shafts.

 82%|████████▏ | 1257/1525 [5:08:12<56:35, 12.67s/it]The correct answer is C. Eruptive syringoma.

Eruptive syringoma is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple small, raised, flesh-colored or light brown papules. The papules are usually located on the face, neck, and upper trunk. They are often asymptomatic, but some people may experience mild itching or irritation.

The cause of eruptive syringoma is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by an abnormal growth of the sweat glands. The condition is more common in women than in men, and it usually occurs in people who are between the ages of 20 and 40.

There is no cure for eruptive syringoma, but the condition can be treated with laser therapy, cryotherapy, or topical medications.

Eruptive vellus hair cysts are small, round, raised bumps that are caused by a blockage of the hair follicle. They are usually found on the face, neck, and upper trunk. Eruptive vellus hair cysts are often mistaken for acne, but they are not contagious.

Urticaria pigmentosa is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of raised, red, itchy wheals. The wheals are caused by a release of histamine from the mast cells in the skin. Urticaria pigmentosa is more common in children than in adults.

Lichen nitidus is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of small, white papules. The papules are usually found on the trunk, arms, and legs. Lichen nitidus is more common in children and young adults.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. Eruptive vellus hair cysts are not usually found on the trunk and legs.
* B. Urticaria pigmentosa is not usually asymptomatic.
* D. Lichen nitidus is not usually characterized by smooth brown papules.

 82%|████████▏ | 1258/1525 [5:08:23<53:59, 12.13s/it]The correct answer is C. Chrysiasis.

Chrysiasis is a condition characterized by the deposition of gold in the skin, hair, and nails. It can be caused by the use of gold salts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. The gold salts are absorbed by the body and deposited in the skin, where they accumulate over time. This can lead to the development of blue-gray or slate-colored patches on the skin, especially on the face, neck, and hands. The hair and nails may also turn a golden color.

In the case presented, the woman had a history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with oral gold salts 15 years ago. She developed diffuse blue to slate-gray patches on her entire face immediately after administration of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser toning. These pigmented lesions corresponded exactly to areas that had previously received laser treatment. Rechallenge with the original Q-switched Nd:YAG laser on the right forearm resulted in the development of a similar slate-gray macule. A skin biopsy specimen of the lesion on the right side of the woman’s face revealed the presence of gold deposits in the dermis.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common condition that can occur after inflammation of the skin. It is characterized by the development of brown or black patches on the skin. The patches are usually flat and smooth, and they may fade over time.

Argyria is a condition characterized by the deposition of silver in the skin, hair, and nails. It can be caused by the ingestion or inhalation of silver salts. The silver salts are absorbed by the body and deposited in the skin, where they accumulate over time. This can lead to the development of a gray or blue-gray discoloration of the skin. The hair and nails may also turn a gray or blue-gray color.

Tattoo pigmentation is a permanent change in the color of the skin caused by the injection of ink into the dermis. The ink particles are deposited in the dermis, where they remain for life.

 83%|████████▎ | 1259/1525 [5:08:37<55:28, 12.51s/it]The correct answer is C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy.

The patient in the case has a history of recurrent meningioma of the right sphenoid wing after tumor resections, followed by adjuvant radiation. This has resulted in the development of neovascularization, which is the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Neovascularization can lead to macular edema, which is swelling of the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision. Macular edema can cause blurred vision, distortion, and vision loss.

Anti-VEGF therapy is a treatment that works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels. It is given by injection into the eye and is effective in treating macular edema. In the case of the patient in the case, anti-VEGF therapy would be the most appropriate treatment because it would help to reduce the swelling in the macula and improve her vision.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Observation is not a treatment for macular edema. It would not help to improve the patient's vision.
* Macular laser photocoagulation is a treatment that uses a laser to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. It is not effective in treating macular edema caused by neovascularization.
* Intravitreal corticosteroid therapy is a treatment that uses steroids to reduce inflammation in the eye. It is not effective in treating macular edema.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

 83%|████████▎ | 1260/1525 [5:08:53<1:00:30, 13.70s/it]The correct answer is B: Prescribe oral cimetidine. The patient has a history of seasonal allergies and presents with intermittent redness, swelling, and itching of the right eye. He has also been diagnosed with warts on his elbow and knee. Topical corticosteroids and cyclosporine have been used without success.

Oral cimetidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including allergic conjunctivitis. It is thought to work by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical that is released by the body's immune system in response to an allergic reaction. This can help to reduce inflammation and itching.

Oral cimetidine is generally safe and well-tolerated. The most common side effects are mild and include diarrhea, headache, and nausea. In rare cases, it can cause more serious side effects, such as liver damage or blood clots.

If oral cimetidine is not effective in treating the patient's symptoms, other medications, such as oral antihistamines or topical corticosteroids, may be prescribed. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the warts.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Oral acyclovir is a medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It is not effective in treating allergic conjunctivitis.
* Continuing to give the patient topical corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine is not likely to be effective, as these medications have already been used without success.
* Referring the patient to an allergist is a reasonable option, but it is not the best option at this time. The patient should be given a trial of oral cimetidine first to see if it is effective in treating his symptoms. If it is not effective, then he can be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.
It is reasoning
 83%|████████▎ | 1261/1525 [5:09:07<1:00:32, 13.76s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of disorders that can occur when a cancer produces antibodies that attack healthy cells in the body. The most common paraneoplastic syndromes involve the nervous system, but they can also affect other organs and tissues.

The patient's history of smoking is a risk factor for cancer, and his symptoms are consistent with a paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the nervous system. The elevated protein and lymphocyte pleocytosis in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are further evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome.

An FDG-PET/CT scan is a test that uses a radioactive tracer to look for areas of increased activity in the body. This test can be helpful in diagnosing paraneoplastic syndromes, as it can identify tumors that may not be visible on other imaging tests.

Paraneoplastic antibodies are antibodies that are produced by the body's immune system in response to cancer cells. These antibodies can attack healthy cells in the body, causing a variety of symptoms. Testing for paraneoplastic antibodies can help to diagnose a paraneoplastic syndrome and identify the specific cancer that is causing it.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not as likely to be helpful in diagnosing a paraneoplastic syndrome. Evoked potentials are tests that measure the electrical activity in the brain and spinal cord. These tests can be helpful in diagnosing certain neurological disorders, but they are not as specific for paraneoplastic syndromes. Electromyography (EMG) is a test that measures the electrical activity in muscles. This test can be helpful in diagnosing certain muscle disorders, but it is not as specific for paraneoplastic syndromes. Checking thiamine levels and starting oral supplementation is not likely to be helpful in this patient, as he does not have any symptoms of thiamine deficiency.

 83%|████████▎ | 1262/1525 [5:09:24<1:03:49, 14.56s/it]The correct answer is B. Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma (IH).

Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the zinc transporter ZIP4. It is characterized by a triad of diarrhea, alopecia, and periorificial dermatitis. The skin lesions are typically erythematous, scaling, and crusted. There is no evidence of ulceration in this case.

Candida albicans is a yeast that can cause a variety of skin infections, including diaper dermatitis. The lesions of candidal diaper dermatitis are typically erythematous, papular, and vesicular. There is no evidence of ulceration in this case.

Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis is a type of diaper rash that is caused by prolonged exposure of the skin to urine and feces. The lesions are typically erythematous, excoriated, and eroded. There is no evidence of telangiectasias in this case.

Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma (IH) is a rare vascular malformation that typically presents in the first few weeks of life. It is characterized by a well-demarcated, raised lesion with a purplish hue. The lesion may ulcerate, particularly if it is traumatized. In this case, the patient has a well-demarcated ulcer with scalloped borders on either side of the midline, superior to the anal verge. There is no exudate or drainage. The base of the ulcers is covered with fibrinous material and the residue of topical medications. Bright red matted telangiectasias extend from the anus to the ulcers. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma.

 83%|████████▎ | 1263/1525 [5:09:35<59:02, 13.52s/it]  The correct answer is D. Metastatic breast carcinoma.

The patient's medical history is significant for localized invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated with wide local excision 13 years previously. At presentation she was considered disease-free. This means that the patient had breast cancer that was confined to the breast and had not spread to other parts of the body. However, 13 years later, she developed a new lesion in the parotid gland. This is a salivary gland located in front of the ear. The lesion was found to be an infiltrative lesion composed of cords and nests of medium-sized cells surrounded by a densely hyalinized stroma. The cells contained hyperchromatic vesicular nuclei with moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the cells were diffusely positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR).

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma. Metastatic breast carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The most common sites of metastasis are the bones, lungs, liver, and brain. In this case, the breast cancer has spread to the parotid gland.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not account for the patient's medical history or the findings on the imaging studies and biopsy.

* Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland cancer that is usually found in the parotid gland. It is not typically associated with a history of breast cancer.
* Salivary duct carcinoma is the most common type of salivary gland cancer. It can occur in any of the salivary glands, but it is most common in the parotid gland. It is not typically associated with a history of breast cancer.
* Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is a type of salivary gland cancer that arises from a pre-existing benign tumor called a pleomorphic adenoma. It is not typically associated with a history of breast cancer.

 83%|████████▎ | 1264/1525 [5:09:44<52:57, 12.17s/it]The correct answer is C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma.

Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a rare, benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that usually presents in the first few years of life. It is characterized by the presence of solitary or multiple, yellow-brown papules or nodules that may be present on any part of the body, but are most common on the head, neck, and trunk. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but may be pruritic or painful.

The diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by histopathologic examination. The histopathologic features of juvenile xanthogranuloma include the presence of lipid-laden histiocytes, eosinophils, and Touton giant cells.

The treatment of juvenile xanthogranuloma is usually not necessary, as the lesions often resolve spontaneously within a few years. However, if the lesions are symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable, they may be treated with surgical excision, laser therapy, or cryotherapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient in the case.

A. Spitz nevus is a rare, benign melanocytic neoplasm that usually presents in children or young adults. It is characterized by a solitary, dome-shaped papule or nodule that is usually <1 cm in diameter. The lesion is often pigmented and may have a central ulceration or crust. The diagnosis of Spitz nevus is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by histopathologic examination. The histopathologic features of Spitz nevus include the presence of large, atypical melanocytes with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli.

B. Pyogenic granuloma is a common, benign vascular neoplasm that usually presents as a rapidly growing, painful papule or nodule. The lesion is often located on the skin of the extremities or face. The diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by histopathologic examination. The histopathologic features of pyogenic granuloma include the presence of a proliferating mass of capillaries and granulation tissue.

C. Dermatofibroma is a common, benign, fibrous neoplasm that usually presents as a solitary, firm papule or nodule on the skin of the extremities. The lesion is often asymptomatic, but may be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis of dermatofibroma is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by histopathologic examination. The histopathologic features of dermatofibroma include the presence of a proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen fibers.

 83%|████████▎ | 1265/1525 [5:10:01<58:53, 13.59s/it]The correct answer is C. Ameloblastic carcinoma.

Ameloblastoma is a rare, benign odontogenic tumor that occurs most commonly in the mandible of young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of ameloblast-like cells, which are the cells that produce enamel. Ameloblastomas are usually slow-growing and asymptomatic, but they can cause expansion of the jaw and facial asymmetry. Treatment is typically surgical excision, with or without radiation therapy.

Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the salivary glands. It is most common in the parotid gland, but it can also occur in the submandibular gland, minor salivary glands, and other head and neck sites. Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma is classified into three grades based on the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells: low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade. Low-grade tumors are the most common and are typically slow-growing and curable with surgery. Intermediate-grade tumors are more aggressive than low-grade tumors, but they are still usually curable with surgery and radiation therapy. High-grade tumors are the most aggressive and are often fatal.

Odontogenic myxoma is a rare, benign odontogenic tumor that occurs most commonly in the mandible of young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of myxoid connective tissue. Odontogenic myxomas are usually slow-growing and asymptomatic, but they can cause expansion of the jaw and facial asymmetry. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

The patient in the case presented with a painless, progressive swelling of the anterior mandible. The mass was hard in consistency with relatively normal overlying mucosa. Computed tomographic (CT) images showed a grossly expansile, multilocular, low-attenuation lesion of the anterior segment of the mandible. The images demonstrated severe erosion of the facial and lingual cortices with a remarkable scalloping pattern, and multiple wispy, ill-defined intralesional septa. Soft-tissue CT images indicated a cystic and solid nature of the mass.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of ameloblastic carcinoma. The CT images show the classic features of ameloblastic carcinoma, including a multilocular, low-attenuation lesion with erosion of the cortical bone. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes ameloblastoma, central mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and odontogenic myxoma.

Ameloblastoma is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Ameloblastomas are the most common odontogenic tumor, and they are typically benign. However, ameloblastomas can rarely be malignant, and this is the most likely diagnosis in this patient given the patient's age, the location of the tumor, and the CT findings.

Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis in this patient. Central mucoepidermoid carcinomas are typically malignant, but they are most common in the parotid gland. This tumor is located in the mandible, which is not a common site for central mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

Odontogenic myxoma is an even less likely diagnosis in this patient. Odontogenic myxomas are typically benign, and they are most common in the mandible of young adults. This tumor is located in the anterior mandible, which is not a common site for odontogenic myxoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is ameloblastic carcinoma.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases that are characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid, a protein that forms fibrillar aggregates. Amyloid can deposit in any organ or tissue in the body, and the clinical manifestations of the disease depend on the site of the deposition.

Localized laryngeal amyloidosis is a rare form of amyloidosis that affects the larynx. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the laryngeal mucosa, submucosa, and muscles. The disease typically presents with hoarseness, a foreign body sensation in the throat, and dysphagia.

The diagnosis of localized laryngeal amyloidosis is made by biopsy. The biopsy specimen is stained with Congo red dye, which will show apple-green birefringence under polarized light.

There is no cure for localized laryngeal amyloidosis. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing complications. This may include voice therapy, surgery, or radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells. It is typically soft and movable, and it does not stain with Congo red dye.
* Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ or tissue in the body. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small, inflammatory nodules. Sarcoidosis does not typically involve the larynx.

A ranula is a fluid-filled cyst that occurs in the floor of the mouth. It is caused by a blockage of a salivary gland duct. Ranulas are typically small and asymptomatic, but they can grow large enough to cause pain and difficulty swallowing.

A lymphangioma is a type of tumor that is made up of lymphatic vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the head and neck region. Lymphangiomas are typically benign (noncancerous), but they can grow large enough to cause problems.

A suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst is a type of cyst that occurs in the neck. It is caused by a remnant of the thyroglossal duct, which is a tube that connects the thyroid gland to the back of the tongue during fetal development. Suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cysts are typically small and asymptomatic, but they can grow large enough to cause problems.

The patient in this case has a 6-cm nontender mass in the submentum. The mass is well-circumscribed, avascular, homogeneous, and isoechoic on ultrasonography. It demonstrates a fluid signal with T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, and peripheral rim enhancement on MRI. These findings are consistent with a dermoid cyst.

Dermoid cysts are typically benign (noncancerous) and can be removed surgically. The prognosis for patients with dermoid cysts is excellent.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. A ranula is a fluid-filled cyst that occurs in the floor of the mouth. It is caused by a blockage of a salivary gland duct. Ranulas are typically small and asymptomatic, but they can grow large enough to cause pain and difficulty swallowing. The patient in this case has a 6-cm nontender mass in the submentum. This is not a typical presentation for a ranula.

 83%|████████▎ | 1268/1525 [5:10:50<1:05:56, 15.40s/it]The correct answer is B: Shingles.

Shingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body for years, sometimes decades. When the virus reactivates, it causes shingles.

Shingles is characterized by a painful, blistering rash that usually appears on one side of the body, often in a band along the nerve. The rash may be accompanied by fever, headache, and muscle aches.

Shingles is most common in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. It is not contagious from person to person, but the virus that causes it can be spread through contact with the fluid in the blisters.

There is no cure for shingles, but there are treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness. Treatment usually includes antiviral medications, pain relievers, and topical treatments for the rash.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the diagnosis of shingles is supported by the following findings:

* The patient has a history of chickenpox.
* The patient has a painful, blistering rash that is localized to one side of the body.
* The patient has a fever.
* The patient has a weakened immune system due to his lymphoma.

The diagnosis of plantar warts is less likely because the patient does not have a history of plantar warts, and the lesions on his foot do not appear to be typical of plantar warts.

The diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma is also less likely because the patient does not have any other signs or symptoms of lymphoma, such as a lymph node mass or a skin rash.

The diagnosis of toxic erythema of chemotherapy is also less likely because the patient does not have any other signs or symptoms of chemotherapy toxicity, such as fever, nausea, or vomiting.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of shingles is the most likely diagnosis in the case of the patient described in the question.

 83%|████████▎ | 1269/1525 [5:11:04<1:04:51, 15.20s/it]The correct answer is D. Ectopic pancreas.

Ectopic pancreas is a rare condition in which pancreatic tissue is found outside of the pancreas. It is most commonly found in the stomach, but it can also occur in the small intestine, colon, and other organs.

The most common symptom of ectopic pancreas is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of ectopic pancreas is made with a combination of imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, and biopsy.

Treatment for ectopic pancreas depends on the size and location of the mass. Small, asymptomatic masses may be left untreated. Larger masses or those that are causing symptoms may be surgically removed.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are most commonly found in the stomach, but they can also occur in the small intestine, colon, and esophagus.

The most common symptom of GIST is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of GIST is made with a combination of imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, and biopsy.

Treatment for GIST depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's age and overall health. Small, asymptomatic tumors may be left untreated. Larger tumors or those that are causing symptoms may be surgically removed.

Gastric cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the stomach. It is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide.

The most common symptom of gastric cancer is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and blood in the stool.

The diagnosis of gastric cancer is made with a combination of imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, and biopsy.

Treatment for gastric cancer depends on the stage of the cancer, as well as the patient's age and overall health. Surgery is the most common treatment for gastric cancer. Other treatments may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Peptic ulcer disease is a condition in which ulcers form in the lining of the stomach or small intestine. Ulcers are caused by a combination of factors, including infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), overuse of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and smoking.

The most common symptom of peptic ulcer disease is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease is made with a combination of history, physical examination, and imaging studies, such as endoscopy.

Treatment for peptic ulcer disease depends on the cause of the ulcer. H. pylori infection is treated with antibiotics. NSAIDs-related ulcers are treated with discontinuation of NSAIDs and treatment with acid-suppressing medications. Ulcers caused by smoking are treated with smoking cessation.

It is the most common type of hemangioma, and it can occur anywhere in the body. The most common symptoms of a cavernous hemangioma are pain, swelling, and a lump. The diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma is usually made with imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment for a cavernous hemangioma is usually not necessary, but surgery may be recommended if the tumor is causing symptoms or if it is growing.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Schwannoma is a type of tumor that grows from the Schwann cells that surround nerve fibers. It is usually benign, but it can be malignant in rare cases. The most common symptoms of a schwannoma are pain, numbness, and weakness. The diagnosis of a schwannoma is usually made with imaging tests, such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment for a schwannoma may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
* Pseudoaneurysm is a bulge in an artery that is caused by a tear in the artery wall. It is usually caused by trauma, but it can also be caused by a medical condition, such as atherosclerosis. The most common symptom of a pseudoaneurysm is pain. The diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm is usually made with imaging tests, such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Treatment for a pseudoaneurysm may include surgery, embolization, or coiling.
* Paraganglioma is a type of tumor that grows from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are located throughout the body. It is usually benign, but it can be malignant in rare cases. The most common symptoms of a paraganglioma are headache, sweating, and flushing.

A positive ANA test result is not specific for any one disease. It can be found in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome. However, it can also be found in people who do not have any autoimmune disease. In this case, the patient has no symptoms of SLE or any other autoimmune disease. She also has no family history of autoimmune diseases. The only positive test result is the ANA test. This suggests that the positive ANA test result may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease is a common condition that affects the thyroid gland. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, and dry skin. However, it can also be asymptomatic. In this case, the patient has no symptoms of autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the positive ANA test result suggests that she may have this condition.

The other answer choices are incorrect. The patient does not have rheumatoid arthritis because she does not have any symptoms of this disease. She also does not have systemic lupus erythematosus because she does not have any symptoms of this disease. And there is no evidence to suggest that she will develop SLE in the future.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. The positive ANA test result is nonspecific and may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease.

The patient has a history of fatigue, an elevated white blood cell count, and a palpable spleen. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy is the most definitive test to diagnose leukemia. It can also help to determine the type of leukemia and the stage of the disease.

A heterophile antibody test is not necessary in this case. This test is used to diagnose mononucleosis, which is a viral infection that can cause fatigue and an elevated white blood cell count. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with mononucleosis.

Starting cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy is premature at this stage. These drugs are used to treat leukemia, but they are very toxic. They should only be started after a definitive diagnosis of leukemia has been made and the stage of the disease has been determined.

Ordering leukapheresis is also not necessary in this case. This procedure is used to remove excess white blood cells from the blood. It is used to treat certain types of leukemia, but it is not indicated in this case.

The lesions of iododerma are typically red, scaly papules that are symmetrically distributed on the forearms. The patient in the case report has these lesions, as well as a high serum iodine level. A punch biopsy of the lesions shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, spongiosis with vesiculation, intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses, focal subepidermal bulla formation, and dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of iododerma.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that can be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including hematologic malignancies, infections, and autoimmune diseases. The lesions of Sweet syndrome are typically painful, tender, erythematous plaques that are often associated with fever, malaise, and weight loss. The patient in the case report does not have any of the systemic features of Sweet syndrome, and his lesions are not painful or tender.

Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and ulcers. The lesions of sporotrichosis are typically solitary and found on the extremities, especially the hands and arms. The patient in the case report has multiple lesions that are symmetrically distributed on both forearms.

Pemphigus vegetans is a rare autoimmune blistering disease that can cause widespread erosions and crusted lesions. The lesions of pemphigus vegetans are typically found on the mucous membranes, but they can also be found on the skin. The patient in the case report does not have any of the typical lesions of pemphigus vegetans.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. Iododerma.

 84%|████████▎ | 1274/1525 [5:12:13<58:33, 14.00s/it]The correct answer is A. Nocardia brasiliensis skin infection.

The patient is a woman in her 50s who was admitted for bacterial pneumonia. She was noted to have an ulcerated plaque on the forearm. The patient had been discharged approximately 2 weeks prior, after an admission for congestive heart failure. A few days after that discharge, the patient noticed a painful ulceration on the right distal forearm, at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted during her initial hospitalization. On physical examination, the patient had an ulcerated plaque on the right forearm with 2 tender, 1- to 2-cm red nodules in the right antecubital fossa. On further questioning, the patient noted that between her hospitalizations she had gone home and cleaned her fish tank, played with her pet cat, and gardened in her indoor cactus garden. She said she had not recently traveled, and was not taking any immunosuppressive medications. A skin biopsy and culture were performed from the forearm lesion.

The Gram stain of the skin biopsy showed gram-positive rods, which are consistent with Nocardia brasiliensis. The culture of the skin biopsy grew Nocardia brasiliensis.

Nocardia brasiliensis is a gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that is found in soil and decaying organic matter. It can cause a variety of infections in humans, including skin infections, pneumonia, and brain abscesses. Nocardia brasiliensis is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer or HIV infection.

The patient's history of recent exposure to soil and decaying organic matter, as well as her underlying medical conditions, make her a risk for Nocardia brasiliensis infection. The Gram stain and culture of the skin biopsy confirm the diagnosis of Nocardia brasiliensis skin infection.

Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive, coccus-shaped bacterium that is commonly found on the skin and in the nose. It can cause a variety of infections in humans, including skin infections, pneumonia, and food poisoning. Staphylococcus aureus is not typically associated with ulcerated plaques on the forearm.

Mycobacterium marinum is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that is found in water and soil. It can cause a skin infection called fish tank granuloma. Mycobacterium marinum is not typically associated with ulcerated plaques on the forearm.

Sporotrichosis schenckii is a fungus that is found in soil and decaying organic matter. It can cause a skin infection called sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis is not typically associated with ulcerated plaques on the forearm.

Axillary acne agminata is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of multiple, small, red-brown papules and nodules in the axillae. The lesions are often follicular in origin and may be associated with scarring. The condition is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to keratinous debris, and it is most commonly seen in women in their 20s and 30s.

The diagnosis of axillary acne agminata is based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional granulomas. There is no specific treatment for axillary acne agminata, but a variety of medications, including topical corticosteroids, oral antibiotics, and systemic retinoids, have been used with variable success. In some cases, surgical excision may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in multiple organs. The skin is involved in approximately 20% of cases, and the lesions typically present as violaceous papules or nodules. Sarcoidosis is most common in African Americans and people of Scandinavian descent.
* Miliary tuberculosis is a disseminated form of tuberculosis characterized by the presence of small, miliary (<1 mm) tubercles in multiple organs. The skin is involved in approximately 10% of cases, and the lesions typically present as small, red-brown papules or nodules. Miliary tuberculosis is most common in people with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive conditions.
* Talc granuloma is a foreign body reaction to talc, a mineral that is often used in cosmetics and other products. The lesions typically present as small, white papules or nodules on the hands, feet, or other areas of the body that have been exposed to talc. Talc granulomas are most common in people who work with talc or who use talc-containing products on a regular basis.

 84%|████████▎ | 1276/1525 [5:12:44<1:01:58, 14.93s/it]The correct answer is C. Excise the lesion.

The lesion is a hemangioma, which is a benign tumor of blood vessels. Hemangiomas are the most common type of tumor in infants and children, and they usually disappear on their own within a few years. However, some hemangiomas can grow larger and cause problems, such as obstruction of the visual axis or ulceration. In these cases, it may be necessary to remove the hemangioma surgically.

In this case, the hemangioma has grown slightly and is encroaching on the visual axis. The patient has also started to rub his eyelid, which can further irritate the lesion and increase the risk of infection. Therefore, it is recommended to remove the hemangioma surgically.

Option A, continue observation, is not the correct answer because the hemangioma is growing and causing problems. Option B, prescribe propranolol hydrochloride, is not the correct answer because propranolol is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems. It is not effective in treating hemangiomas. Option C, excise the lesion, is the correct answer because it is the only option that will remove the hemangioma and prevent further problems. Option D, perform curettage of the lesion, is not the correct answer because curettage is a procedure that is used to remove superficial lesions. It is not effective in removing hemangiomas.

 84%|████████▎ | 1277/1525 [5:12:52<52:42, 12.75s/it]  The correct answer is C. Perform fluorescein angiography.

Fluorescein angiography is a diagnostic procedure that uses a special dye to visualize blood vessels in the eye. It is used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.

In this case, the patient has acute-onset bilateral decreased vision and metamorphopsia. The history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a self-limiting inflammatory condition of the retina that typically affects young to middle-aged adults. It is characterized by the sudden onset of blurred vision, floaters, and metamorphopsia. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical findings, and fluorescein angiography is often used to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease.

The treatment for APMPPE is usually supportive. This may include bed rest, dark glasses, and artificial tears. In some cases, steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. The vast majority of patients with APMPPE recover their vision completely within a few weeks or months. However, some patients may experience permanent vision loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B-scan ultrasonography is a diagnostic procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the eye. It is used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts. However, it is not used to diagnose APMPPE.
* Electroretinography is a diagnostic procedure that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. However, it is not used to diagnose APMPPE.
* Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a diagnostic procedure that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of blood vessels in the body. It is used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including stroke, aneurysm, and cancer. However, it is not used to diagnose APMPPE.

 84%|████████▍ | 1278/1525 [5:13:06<54:51, 13.33s/it]The correct answer is C. Plexiform neurofibroma.

Acute parotitis or parotid abscess is an infection of the parotid gland, which is a salivary gland located in the cheek. Symptoms include fever, pain, and swelling of the cheek. The condition is usually treated with antibiotics.

Venous malformation is a type of vascular malformation that is caused by abnormal development of veins. Symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the malformation. Treatment may include surgery, embolization, or laser therapy.

Infantile hemangioma is a type of birthmark that is caused by abnormal growth of blood vessels. Symptoms include a red or purple spot on the skin. The condition usually resolves on its own within a few years.

Plexiform neurofibroma is a type of tumor that grows on nerves. It is a characteristic feature of neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder. Symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the tumor. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

In the case presented, the patient has a left-sided facial mass, macrocephaly, and a congenital hypertrichotic patch of the left scalp. These findings are consistent with neurofibromatosis type 1. The patient also has a history of recurrent otitis media, which is a common complication of neurofibromatosis type 1. The magnetic resonance imaging findings are consistent with a plexiform neurofibroma.

Acute parotitis or parotid abscess is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have fever or pain. Venous malformation is also unlikely because the patient does not have any other symptoms of a vascular malformation. Infantile hemangioma is unlikely because the patient is older than the age at which hemangiomas usually resolve.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is plexiform neurofibroma.

 84%|████████▍ | 1279/1525 [5:13:23<58:17, 14.22s/it]The correct answer is A. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland.

The patient is a young Asian man with a nontender, slowly enlarging mass in the left parotid region. He has also experienced occasional blepharospasm and paresthesia in the ipsilateral eye and cheek. He has lost 3 kg in weight, which he attributes to stress. Physical examination reveals a firm, immobile, irregular mass in the left parotid gland. Mild left-sided buccal weakness is noted. Otherwise, cranial nerve function is intact. Fine needle aspiration demonstrates medium-size ovoid cells with minimal cytoplasm in crowded groups. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging following the initial computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrates a poorly marginated mass that is 4 cm in maximum diameter abutting the left superficial parotid with involvement of the masseter. A parotidectomy with excision of the tumor was planned. During the initial exposure of the tumor, an intraoperative frozen section demonstrated a cellular infiltrate, and a diagnosis of lymphoma could not be excluded. Given the size and fixed nature of the tumor, the decision was made to stop resection on establishing a definitive diagnosis. Flow cytometry demonstrated phenotypically normal T-cell and B-cell populations. Permanent histologic sections demonstrated nests of nonkeratinizing undifferentiated atypical epithelial cells intimately intermingled with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin AE1/3 was positive in the carcinoma cells. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small RNAs (EBERs) was positive.

The differential diagnosis for a nontender, slowly enlarging mass in the parotid gland includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign tumors of the parotid gland are pleomorphic adenomas, followed by Warthin tumors and monomorphic adenomas. Malignant tumors of the parotid gland include mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland. This is a rare, aggressive malignancy that typically occurs in young adults, particularly of Asian descent. The tumor is characterized by the presence of a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, which is often mistaken for lymphoma on initial biopsy. Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization for EBV are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma.

The treatment of lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland is surgical resection with adjuvant radiation therapy. The prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Undifferentiated carcinoma of parotid gland is a rare, aggressive malignancy that typically occurs in older adults. It is not associated with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate or EBV infection.
* Lymphoma is a group of hematologic malignancies that arise from lymphocytes. It is not typically associated with a mass in the parotid gland.
* Metastatic squamous carcinoma to parotid gland is a relatively uncommon occurrence. It is usually the result of metastasis from a primary squamous carcinoma of the head and neck.

 84%|████████▍ | 1280/1525 [5:13:40<1:01:26, 15.05s/it]The correct answer is D. Calcinosis cutis.

Calcinosis cutis is a rare skin condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the skin. It can occur as a primary disorder or secondary to a number of other conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism, renal failure, and dermatomyositis.

The most common presentation of calcinosis cutis is a small, firm, subcutaneous nodule that is usually painless. The nodules can be white, yellow, or brown, and they may be solitary or multiple. They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the hands, feet, elbows, and knees.

The diagnosis of calcinosis cutis is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows the characteristic deposition of calcium salts in the skin.

There is no cure for calcinosis cutis, but the symptoms can be treated with a number of medications, including corticosteroids, colchicine, and diphosphonates. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the nodules.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical presentation of the patient in the case.

A schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. Schwannomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck, followed by the arms and legs. The most common symptom of a schwannoma is a painless mass. Schwannomas are usually benign, but they can rarely become malignant.

A hamartoma is a benign tumor that is composed of normal tissue that is present in the wrong place. Hamartomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin, brain, and heart. The most common symptom of a hamartoma is a mass. Hamartomas are usually benign, but they can rarely become malignant.

An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that arises from the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin. Epidermoid cysts are most common on the face, neck, scalp, and trunk. The most common symptom of an epidermoid cyst is a small, firm, painless lump. Epidermoid cysts are usually benign, but they can rarely become infected or inflamed.

 84%|████████▍ | 1281/1525 [5:13:52<57:45, 14.20s/it]  The correct answer is C. Sialolipoma.

Parotitis is an inflammation of the parotid gland, which is one of the salivary glands located in front of the ear. It is usually caused by a viral infection, but it can also be caused by bacteria, fungi, or autoimmune disorders. Parotitis typically presents with pain, swelling, and tenderness in the parotid gland. In some cases, there may also be fever, headache, and a loss of taste. Treatment for parotitis typically involves rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain medication. In severe cases, antibiotics may be prescribed.

Lipoma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor of fat cells. It is the most common type of soft tissue tumor, and it typically occurs in adults. Lipomas are usually soft, painless, and movable. They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk, neck, and arms. Treatment for lipomas is usually not necessary, but they can be removed surgically if they are large or unsightly.

Hemangioma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common type of tumor in infants and children. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the head and neck. They typically appear as a red, raised spot on the skin. Hemangiomas usually go away on their own within a few years, but they may require treatment if they are large or cause problems.

In the case of the infant girl in the question, the most likely diagnosis is sialolipoma. This is because the mass is located in the parotid gland, it is soft, mobile, and non-tender, and it does not cause any facial nerve impairment. The MRI findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of sialolipoma. Sialolipomas are benign tumors that are composed of both fat and salivary gland tissue. They are usually small and asymptomatic, but they can occasionally grow large enough to cause symptoms such as facial asymmetry or pain. Treatment for sialolipomas is usually not necessary, but they can be removed surgically if they are large or symptomatic.

 84%|████████▍ | 1282/1525 [5:14:06<57:36, 14.22s/it]The correct answer is C. Eagle syndrome.

Eagle syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by pain in the head, neck, and face that is caused by an elongated styloid process. The styloid process is a small, bony projection that extends from the base of the skull. In people with Eagle syndrome, the styloid process is abnormally long and can press on nerves and blood vessels in the neck, causing pain.

The symptoms of Eagle syndrome can vary from person to person. Some people may only experience pain in the neck or face, while others may also experience symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and hearing loss. The pain is often described as sharp, stabbing, or burning. It can be worse when swallowing, yawning, or turning the head.

The diagnosis of Eagle syndrome is often made based on a patient's history and physical examination. Imaging tests, such as CT scans or MRIs, can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for Eagle syndrome, but there are treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms. Treatment options include medications, physical therapy, and surgery.

Hyoid bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, a fluid-filled sac that cushions the hyoid bone, a small bone in the neck. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is a disorder that affects the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which is located between the jaw and the skull. Metastatic thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that has spread from the thyroid gland to other parts of the body.

Hyoid bursitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and metastatic thyroid cancer are all possible causes of the patient's symptoms. However, the most likely cause is Eagle syndrome, based on the patient's history and physical examination. The patient's history of blunt trauma to the left maxilla region approximately 10 years prior to presentation is a risk factor for Eagle syndrome. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with Eagle syndrome. The pain is described as sharp, stabbing, or burning and is worse when swallowing, yawning, or turning the head. Imaging tests, such as CT scans or MRIs, can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Eagle syndrome.

Pulmonary artery sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the pulmonary artery. It is the most common type of primary lung cancer in children and young adults.

The most common symptom of pulmonary artery sarcoma is shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include chest pain, cough, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of pulmonary artery sarcoma is made with a CT scan or MRI of the chest. A biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for pulmonary artery sarcoma, but treatment can help to control the cancer and improve the quality of life. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The prognosis for pulmonary artery sarcoma is poor. The average survival time is about 12 months. However, some people with the disease may live for several years.

A. Venous thromboembolic disease is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a venous thromboembolic event. The CT scan of the chest shows a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery, which is more consistent with a pulmonary artery tumor than a venous thromboembolic event.

C. Locally advanced lung cancer is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a lung cancer. The CT scan of the chest shows a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery, which is more consistent with a pulmonary artery tumor than a lung cancer.

D. Pulmonary tumor embolism is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a pulmonary tumor embolism. The CT scan of the chest shows a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery, which is more consistent with a pulmonary artery tumor than a pulmonary tumor embolism.

 84%|████████▍ | 1284/1525 [5:14:30<52:39, 13.11s/it]The correct answer is D. The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution.

The patient's disease has relapsed 2.5 years after treatment with fludarabine and rituximab (FR). This suggests that the patient's CLL is resistant to this type of therapy. Unmutated IgHV status is a poor prognostic factor in CLL, and it is associated with resistance to FR treatment. The patient's cytogenetic tests showed complex karyotype with del(17)(p13.1) in 35% of her cells as a new abnormality. This is an unfavorable cytogenetic abnormality that is associated with a poor prognosis in CLL. The patient's ZAP-70 protein expression/promoter unmethylated status is also positive, which is another poor prognostic factor in CLL. Finally, the patient's disease has shown clonal evolution, which is a process by which the malignant B cells acquire new genetic changes. This can lead to resistance to therapy and a more aggressive course of disease.

In conclusion, the patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution. These factors suggest that the patient's CLL is resistant to FR treatment and that she is at risk for a poor prognosis. Further treatment options should be discussed with the patient.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* A. The patient is much less likely to respond and have a durable remission with chemoimmunotherapy. This is a true statement, but it is not the most important factor to consider in this case. The patient's cytogenetic tests and IgHV status are more important predictors of her response to therapy than her age or sex.
* B. The patient is at lower risk of Richter transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is a false statement. Richter transformation is a rare complication of CLL that can occur at any stage of the disease. It is not associated with any particular cytogenetic abnormality or IgHV status.
* C. IgHV-mutated status is defined by more than a 2% sequence difference compared with the germline sequence and can change over the evolution of the disease. This is a true statement, but it is not relevant to this case. The patient's IgHV status is unmutated, which is a poor prognostic factor.
* D. The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution. This is the correct answer. The patient's cytogenetic tests and IgHV status are unfavorable prognostic factors. Her ZAP-70 protein expression/promoter unmethylated status is also positive, which is a poor prognostic factor. The patient's disease has also shown clonal evolution, which is a process by which the malignant B cells acquire new genetic changes. This can lead to resistance to therapy and a more aggressive course of disease.

 84%|████████▍ | 1285/1525 [5:14:42<51:30, 12.88s/it]The correct diagnosis is intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). IPMN is a type of neoplasm that arises in the ducts of the pancreas. It is the most common type of pancreatic neoplasm in the Western world. IPMNs are usually benign, but they can be malignant. The risk of malignancy is higher in IPMNs that are larger, have solid components, or are located in the head of the pancreas.

The patient in the case report has several features that are consistent with IPMN. First, he has diarrhea, which is a common symptom of IPMN. Second, he has weight loss, which is another common symptom of IPMN. Third, he has a 4.7 × 2.9-cm, heterogeneous, solid mass involving the ampulla of Vater and the head of the pancreas. This mass is consistent with an IPMN. Fourth, the patient's laboratory tests showed a carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level of less than 1 U/mL and a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 6.0 ng/mL. These levels are not elevated enough to suggest malignancy, but they are consistent with IPMN. Fifth, the patient's computed tomographic scan showed a heterogeneous soft-tissue nodule involving the ampulla of Vater and the head of the pancreas. This nodule is consistent with an IPMN.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Mucinous cystic neoplasm is a type of neoplasm that arises in the ducts of the pancreas. It is less common than IPMN. Mucinous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, but they can be malignant. The risk of malignancy is higher in mucinous cystic neoplasms that are larger, have solid components, or are located in the head of the pancreas. The patient in the case report does not have any features that are consistent with mucinous cystic neoplasm.
* Primary duodenal carcinoid tumor is a type of tumor that arises from the neuroendocrine cells of the duodenum. It is a rare tumor. Carcinoid tumors are usually benign, but they can be malignant. The risk of malignancy is higher in carcinoid tumors that are larger, have solid components, or are located in the distal duodenum. The patient in the case report does not have any features that are consistent with primary duodenal carcinoid tumor.
* Serous cystadenoma is a type of neoplasm that arises in the ducts of the pancreas. It is a rare tumor. Serous cystadenomas are usually benign, but they can be malignant. The risk of malignancy is higher in serous cystadenomas that are larger, have solid components, or are located in the head of the pancreas. The patient in the case report does not have any features that are consistent with serous cystadenoma.

 84%|████████▍ | 1286/1525 [5:14:59<56:10, 14.10s/it]The correct answer is C. Innominate artery pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm is a blood-filled sac that forms when the wall of an artery is weakened and ruptures. The weakened wall can be caused by a number of things, including infection, trauma, or surgery.

Innominate artery pseudoaneurysms are the most common type of pseudoaneurysm in the neck. They occur when the innominate artery, which is the main artery that supplies blood to the head and neck, is damaged.

The symptoms of an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm can vary depending on the size and location of the aneurysm. Some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience pain, swelling, or a pulsatile mass in the neck.

If an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm is large or if it is causing symptoms, it may need to be treated. Treatment options include surgery to repair the aneurysm or to bypass the aneurysm.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Carotid stump syndrome is a condition that occurs when the carotid artery is ligated (tied off). This can cause blood to back up and flow into the collateral circulation, which can lead to ischemia (lack of blood flow) in the brain. The patient in this case does not have any history of carotid artery ligation, so carotid stump syndrome is not a likely diagnosis.
* Subclavian pseudoaneurysm is a blood-filled sac that forms when the wall of the subclavian artery is weakened and ruptures. The subclavian artery is a major artery that supplies blood to the arm. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a subclavian pseudoaneurysm, such as pain, swelling, or a pulsatile mass in the arm. Therefore, subclavian pseudoaneurysm is not a likely diagnosis.
* Kommerell diverticulum is a small, sac-like protrusion that forms on the wall of the aorta. The aorta is the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Kommerell diverticula are most often found in people with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. The patient in this case does not have any history of Marfan syndrome, so Kommerell diverticulum is not a likely diagnosis.

The patient has a history of HIV infection and autoimmune hepatitis. Both of these conditions can increase the risk of developing secondary syphilis. The patient's recent onset of fever and rash is consistent with syphilis. A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is a blood test that can be used to screen for syphilis. If the RPR test is positive, the patient should be further evaluated with a treponemal-specific test, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.

A is incorrect because statin-associated hepatitis is a rare side effect of statin therapy. The patient's liver biopsy showed findings suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis, not statin-associated hepatitis.

B is incorrect because the patient's rash is not consistent with autoimmune hepatitis. The rash is more consistent with syphilis.

D is incorrect because biopsy of the skin lesions is not necessary to diagnose syphilis. An RPR test is the most appropriate test to screen for syphilis.

 84%|████████▍ | 1288/1525 [5:15:26<54:40, 13.84s/it]The correct answer is A. Rule out PE and perform a work up for alternative diagnoses.

The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE), including dyslipidemia, obesity, past tobacco use, anxiety, and borderline hypertension. He also presents with shortness of breath on exertion, pleuritic chest pain, and no hemoptysis. These symptoms are consistent with PE, but they can also be caused by other conditions, such as pneumonia, heart failure, or arrhythmia.

The patient's chest X-ray was normal, but this does not rule out PE. A chest X-ray is not very sensitive for PE, meaning that it can miss many cases of the disease. A more sensitive test for PE is computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). CTPA is a type of CT scan that can visualize the blood vessels in the lungs. If a CTPA shows a clot in a pulmonary artery, it is a definitive diagnosis of PE.

In this case, the patient's CTPA result is negative, meaning that there is no evidence of a clot in his pulmonary arteries. This does not necessarily mean that he does not have PE, however. CTPA can miss some cases of PE, especially small clots. Additionally, PE can sometimes cause symptoms even if there is no clot visible on CTPA.

Therefore, the best next step in this patient's management is to rule out PE and perform a work up for alternative diagnoses. This could include further testing, such as a lung ventilation-perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scan or pulmonary angiogram. It could also include treatment for the patient's symptoms, such as oxygen therapy or diuretics.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Obtain a bilateral lower limb veins compression ultrasonography. This test can be used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a clot in a deep vein in the leg. However, DVT is not the only cause of PE, and a negative DVT study does not rule out PE.
* C. Obtain a lung ventilation-perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scan or pulmonary angiogram. These tests can be used to diagnose PE, but they are more invasive than CTPA. They are also not as sensitive for small clots, and they can be difficult to interpret in some cases.
* D. Test for D-dimer. D-dimer is a blood test that can be used to detect the presence of blood clots. However, D-dimer is not a specific test for PE, and a positive D-dimer does not necessarily mean that the patient has PE.

It is characterized by a rash that can appear on the palms, soles, and oropharynx. Other symptoms may include fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an infection caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. The rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is typically found on the wrists, ankles, and palms. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, and muscle aches.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a viral infection that is most common in children. It is caused by coxsackieviruses A and B. The rash of hand, foot, and mouth disease is typically found on the hands, feet, and mouth. Other symptoms may include fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy.

Primary human immunodeficiency virus infection is the initial stage of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is characterized by a flu-like illness that typically resolves within a few weeks. There is no rash associated with primary HIV infection.

The patient in the case presentation has a rash on the palms, soles, and oropharynx. This is consistent with the rash of secondary syphilis. The patient also has a history of sexual activity with men, which is a risk factor for syphilis. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with secondary syphilis. The patient does not have any of the symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, hand, foot, and mouth disease, or primary HIV infection. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is secondary syphilis.

The patient is a man in his 50s with a history of type 2 diabetes and an allogenic bone marrow transplant 1 year prior. He presents with a chronic, painful, nonhealing ulcer on the right forearm following a ground-level fall 3 months previously. He reports subjective fevers, as well as increasing erythema and tenderness immediately around the right forearm lesion. He stated that he did not have a history of poor wound healing or painful skin ulcers.

The physical examination reveals an isolated slightly erythematous, edematous plaque with a prominent central eschar on the right forearm. An incisional biopsy at the edge of the eschar was performed, and a specimen was sent for pathological evaluation. The histopathologic images show necrotic debris and fat necrosis with saponification, saponification and needle-like clefts within necrotic adipocytes, and numerous nonseptate, thick-walled fungal hyphae in the dermis.

Cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare, but potentially life-threatening infection caused by fungi of the Mucorales order. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes, hematologic malignancies, and solid organ transplants. The most common clinical presentation is a rapidly progressive, necrotizing skin infection. Other possible manifestations include rhinocerebral mucormycosis, gastrointestinal mucormycosis, and disseminated mucormycosis.

The diagnosis of cutaneous mucormycosis is made based on clinical suspicion, histopathologic findings, and culture results. The treatment of cutaneous mucormycosis is challenging and often unsuccessful. Treatment options include antifungal therapy, surgical debridement, and supportive care.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a noninfectious, inflammatory skin condition that can present with a similar clinical appearance to cutaneous mucormycosis. However, pyoderma gangrenosum is typically seen in patients with underlying inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. The histopathologic findings in pyoderma gangrenosum are also different from those seen in cutaneous mucormycosis.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of the skin that can also present with a chronic, nonhealing ulcer. However, squamous cell carcinoma is typically seen in older adults and is more common on sun-exposed areas of the skin. The histopathologic findings in squamous cell carcinoma are also different from those seen in cutaneous mucormycosis.
* Cutaneous aspergillosis is a fungal infection of the skin that can present with a similar clinical appearance to cutaneous mucormycosis. However, cutaneous aspergillosis is typically seen in patients with underlying lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis. The histopathologic findings in cutaneous aspergillosis are also different from those seen in cutaneous mucormycosis.

The patient is a man in his 70s who presented with erythematous ears associated with a burning sensation. The lesions had begun 6 months previously and were most bothersome at the end of the day or when he was exposed to the cold and damp environment while out on his boat. He applied ice to alleviate the burning, but this worsened the condition. A heating pad provided some measure of relief, as did a brief course of systemic corticosteroids.

Physical examination revealed that some papular lesions were associated with slight purpura and hemorrhagic crust. Histologic findings from biopsy specimens were also obtained by routine histologic analysis and direct immunofluorescence examination.

The biopsy specimen from the left ear revealed thrombi within engorged blood vessels but failed to reveal significant inflammation of blood vessel walls. The biopsy specimen from the left ear under direct immunofluorescence and stained for anti-IgM highlighted thrombi within vessels.

These findings are consistent with cold agglutinin disease, which is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack red blood cells, causing them to clump together. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including anemia, Raynaud's phenomenon, and cold-induced skin lesions.

Relapsing polychondritis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the cartilage in the ears, nose, and joints. It is characterized by recurrent attacks of inflammation and pain. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect any organ in the body, but it most commonly affects the lungs, kidneys, and upper respiratory tract. Chilblain is a condition that occurs when the skin is exposed to cold and dampness. It is characterized by redness, swelling, and itching of the skin.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with cold agglutinin disease. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

A. Administering hyperfocal cryotherapy to the eyelid nodules is not the most appropriate next step because it is not a definitive treatment for this condition. Cryotherapy can be used to reduce the size of the nodules, but it does not address the underlying cause of the condition.

B. Starting D-penicillamine therapy is not the most appropriate next step because this is a treatment for Wilson's disease, which is not a likely diagnosis in this patient. Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to build up in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms, including liver damage, neurological problems, and psychiatric problems. The patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of Wilson's disease, and there is no family history of the disease.

D. Assessing for an enlarged tongue with decreased motility is not the most appropriate next step because this is not a likely finding in this patient. The patient does not have any symptoms of an enlarged tongue, and there is no evidence of an underlying neurological disorder.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to perform an eyelid nodule biopsy. This will allow the doctor to determine the underlying cause of the nodules and to recommend the most appropriate treatment.

 85%|████████▍ | 1293/1525 [5:16:44<58:50, 15.22s/it]  The correct answer is A. Perform a serum test for autoantibodies.

The patient in this case has a history of sinusitis that was treated with antibiotics. Five days later, he developed painless horizontal diplopia. This is a common symptom of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, including the extraocular muscles that control eye movement. Myasthenia gravis is characterized by fluctuating weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. It is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient in this case does not have any other symptoms of myasthenia gravis, such as ptosis (drooping eyelids), facial weakness, or difficulty chewing or swallowing. However, the presence of painless horizontal diplopia after a sinus infection is a concerning finding. A serum test for autoantibodies can help to confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not be helpful in diagnosing myasthenia gravis.

B. Perform a tensilon test: A tensilon test is a diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis. It involves injecting the drug edrophonium (Tensilon) into a vein. Edrophonium is a short-acting anticholinesterase that temporarily improves muscle strength in patients with myasthenia gravis. However, this test is not always reliable, and it can be dangerous in patients with certain heart conditions.

C. Perform magnetic resonance venography: Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a test that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the veins in the brain. MRV can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including venous sinus thrombosis. However, MRV would not be helpful in diagnosing myasthenia gravis.

D. Restart antibiotic treatment and arrange for an otorhinolaryngology follow-up examination: Restarting antibiotic treatment would not be helpful in treating myasthenia gravis. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, and myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder. An otorhinolaryngology follow-up examination would be helpful in diagnosing and treating sinusitis. However, it would not be helpful in diagnosing myasthenia gravis.

 85%|████████▍ | 1294/1525 [5:16:59<57:27, 14.92s/it]The correct diagnosis for the patient is recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON). This is a rare disorder that causes inflammation and swelling of the third cranial nerve, which controls movement of the eye. The symptoms of RPON typically include sudden onset of pain in and around the eye, followed by ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and diplopia (double vision). In some cases, the patient may also experience headache, nausea, and vomiting.

The exact cause of RPON is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, in this case the third cranial nerve. RPON is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people between the ages of 20 and 40.

There is no cure for RPON, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. The most common treatment is corticosteroids, which are drugs that reduce inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to decompress the third cranial nerve.

The prognosis for RPON is generally good. Most people with the disorder make a full recovery within a few weeks or months. However, some people may experience recurrent episodes of RPON.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Recurrent meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Meningitis can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, stiff neck, and photophobia (sensitivity to light). However, it does not typically cause ptosis or diplopia.
* A posterior communicating artery aneurysm is a bulge in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Aneurysms can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size and location. However, they do not typically cause ptosis or diplopia.

A. Malignant melanoma of nasopharynx is incorrect because the lesion is not invasive and there is no evidence of metastasis.

B. Metastatic melanoma is incorrect because the lesion is not consistent with metastatic melanoma. Metastatic melanoma typically presents as a single, large, pigmented lesion with irregular borders. The lesion in this case is small, multiple, and well-circumscribed.

C. Melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx is the correct diagnosis because the lesion is consistent with this diagnosis. Oncocytic metaplasia is a benign condition in which the cells of the respiratory epithelium become enlarged and contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The brown pigment in the cytoplasm of the cells in this case is consistent with melanin.

D. Hemangioma is incorrect because the lesion is not consistent with hemangioma. Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that typically present as a single, red, vascular lesion. The lesion in this case is small, multiple, and non-vascular.

Myositis ossificans traumatica (MOT) is a rare condition that causes the formation of bone in soft tissue, typically after an injury. It is thought to be caused by a disruption of the blood supply to the muscle, which leads to inflammation and the formation of scar tissue. Over time, this scar tissue can calcify and form bone.

The most common symptom of MOT is pain and swelling in the affected area. This can be followed by stiffness and limited range of motion. In some cases, there may also be a visible lump or bump.

The diagnosis of MOT is based on a physical examination and imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans. There is no specific treatment for MOT, but it usually goes away on its own over time. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bone.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It is not caused by injury and does not typically cause trismus.
* Osteosarcoma is a cancer of the bone. It is not caused by injury and does not typically cause trismus.
* Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition that causes the formation of calcium deposits in soft tissue. It is not caused by injury and does not typically cause trismus.

 85%|████████▌ | 1297/1525 [5:17:46<57:40, 15.18s/it]  The correct answer is C. Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

The patient presented with a history of worsening sinusitis and vision loss. He had a previous diagnosis of benign nasal polyps, but had been lost to follow-up. On physical examination, he had severe left proptosis, telecanthus, purulent nasal drainage, and nasal polyps filling the bilateral nasal cavities. Computed tomographic imaging revealed extensive nasal polyposis, bony remodeling consistent with long-standing inflammation, and massive erosion of the bilateral skull base and orbits. The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery, during which the polyps were found to have an atypical, fibrotic endoscopic appearance. Tissue was sent for histologic evaluation, which confirmed the diagnosis of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the sinuses that is caused by an allergic reaction to fungi. It is characterized by nasal polyps, facial pain, and congestion. However, it does not typically cause bony erosion or vision loss.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that can occur in the sinuses. It is characterized by rapid growth, bone destruction, and invasion of surrounding tissues. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, such as a mass in the nose or sinuses, facial pain, or numbness.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the sinuses that is characterized by nasal polyps, facial pain, and congestion. It is the most common type of chronic sinusitis. However, it does not typically cause bony erosion or vision loss.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. This is a serious condition that can cause significant damage to the sinuses and surrounding tissues. It is important to diagnose and treat this condition early to prevent further complications.

 85%|████████▌ | 1298/1525 [5:18:02<58:17, 15.41s/it]The correct diagnosis is radiation-induced neurofibroma. This is supported by the following evidence:

* The patient has a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right submandibular gland and had undergone wide tumor excision and postoperative radiation therapy 20 years previously. This history is consistent with the development of a radiation-induced neoplasm.
* The tumor is located in the floor of the mouth, which is a common site for radiation-induced neoplasms.
* The tumor is well-defined and enhancing on magnetic resonance imaging, which is also consistent with a radiation-induced neoplasm.
* The tumor is composed of oval to eel-like spindle nuclei distributed in a background of generally wavy collagenous fibers and mucinous matrix, which is characteristic of a neurofibroma.
* The tumor is immunoreactive for S-100, which is a marker of Schwann cells. Schwann cells are the cells that form neurofibromas.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma is unlikely because the patient had undergone wide tumor excision and postoperative radiation therapy 20 years previously. This treatment is typically curative for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
* Radiation-induced liposarcoma is unlikely because the tumor is not composed of lipocytes.
* Radiation-induced rhabdomyosarcoma is unlikely because the tumor is not composed of rhabdomyoblasts.

Laryngeal sarcoidosis is a rare condition that occurs when cells called granulomas form in the larynx. Granulomas are small, round collections of cells that can form in response to infection, inflammation, or injury. In laryngeal sarcoidosis, the granulomas typically form in the supraglottic structures, which are the parts of the larynx that are above the vocal cords.

The symptoms of laryngeal sarcoidosis vary depending on the size and location of the granulomas. Common symptoms include hoarseness, a change in voice quality, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and odynophagia (painful swallowing). In some cases, the granulomas can block the airway, leading to difficulty breathing.

The diagnosis of laryngeal sarcoidosis is made based on a history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for laryngeal sarcoidosis, but the condition can often be managed with treatment. Treatment typically involves the use of corticosteroids, which can help to reduce the size and inflammation of the granulomas. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the granulomas or to widen the airway.

The prognosis for laryngeal sarcoidosis is generally good. Most people with the condition experience a full recovery with treatment. However, in some cases, the condition can be chronic and may require long-term treatment.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on the CT scan.

A. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the larynx. The symptoms of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma can include hoarseness, a change in voice quality, dysphagia, and odynophagia. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and the CT scan does not show any evidence of cancer.

B. Angioedema is a condition that causes swelling of the skin and tissues beneath the skin. Angioedema can be caused by a number of different things, including allergies, medications, and infections. The symptoms of angioedema can include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, and extremities. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for angioedema, and the CT scan does not show any evidence of swelling in the skin or tissues beneath the skin.

C. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a type of tuberculosis that affects the larynx. The symptoms of laryngeal tuberculosis can include hoarseness, a change in voice quality, dysphagia, and odynophagia. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for laryngeal tuberculosis, and the CT scan does not show any evidence of tuberculosis.

 85%|████████▌ | 1300/1525 [5:18:35<59:39, 15.91s/it]The correct answer is B. Refer for ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography.

The patient has a history of breast cancer, which is a risk factor for metastatic disease to the orbit. The patient also has a red and swollen eyelid, which could be a sign of infection or metastasis. The best way to evaluate the patient and determine the cause of her eyelid swelling is to refer her to an ophthalmologist for an examination and orbital computed tomography.

Eyelid scrubs are not indicated in this case because the patient's eyelid swelling is not likely caused by blepharitis. Blepharitis is a common condition that causes inflammation of the eyelids, but it does not typically cause redness, swelling, or ptosis.

Prescribing oral amoxicillin sodium–clavulanate potassium is not indicated in this case because the patient's eyelid swelling is not likely caused by an infection. Infections of the eyelid are usually caused by bacteria, and amoxicillin sodium–clavulanate potassium is an antibiotic that is effective against bacteria. However, the patient's history of breast cancer makes it more likely that her eyelid swelling is caused by metastasis, which is not treated with antibiotics.

Obtaining a positron-emission tomographic scan is not indicated in this case because the patient's eyelid swelling is not likely caused by metastatic disease. Positron-emission tomography is a scan that is used to detect cancer, but it is not necessary to diagnose metastatic disease to the orbit. The patient's history of breast cancer and her eyelid swelling are more likely to be caused by a local infection or inflammation.

 85%|████████▌ | 1301/1525 [5:18:51<1:00:15, 16.14s/it]The correct answer is C. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC).

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system. It is not a common cancer in young adults, and it is not typically associated with abdominal masses.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a type of mesenchymal tumor that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are most common in the stomach and small intestine, but they can also occur in the esophagus, colon, and rectum. GISTs are not typically associated with abdominal masses in young adults.

Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are a type of cancer that starts in the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas. They are rare, and they are not typically associated with abdominal masses in young adults.

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare type of liver cancer that is most common in young women. It is characterized by the presence of large, well-defined tumors that are often cystic. FL-HCC is not typically associated with other medical conditions, and it is not typically associated with abdominal masses in young adults.

In the case presented, the patient is a 20-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department after a motor vehicle crash. She had no history of medical problems. Computed tomography images of the abdomen showed two large mesenteric masses adjacent to the liver, pancreas, and stomach. An endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the abdominal mass was obtained and the diagnosis of FL-HCC was made. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and en-bloc resection of the intraperitoneal tumors.

The diagnosis of FL-HCC is supported by the patient's age, the location of the tumors, and the imaging findings. The patient's age is consistent with the peak incidence of FL-HCC, which is between the ages of 20 and 40 years. The location of the tumors is also consistent with FL-HCC, which is most commonly found in the liver. The imaging findings are also consistent with FL-HCC, which is typically characterized by large, well-defined tumors that are often cystic.

The other answer choices are less likely for the following reasons:

* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not typically associated with abdominal masses in young adults.
* GISTs are most common in the stomach and small intestine, and they are not typically associated with abdominal masses in young adults.
* Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are rare, and they are not typically associated with abdominal masses in young adults.

A Meckel diverticulum is a common congenital anomaly, present in about 2% of the population. It is a remnant of the vitelline duct, which normally regresses during fetal development. Meckel diverticula are located in the distal ileum, approximately 2 feet from the ileocecal valve. They can be asymptomatic or may cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bleeding, and obstruction.

The most common finding on imaging studies of Meckel diverticula is a small, blind-ending tubular structure located in the distal ileum. Calcifications may be present in the wall of the diverticulum, as seen in the case presented.

The differential diagnosis for Meckel diverticulum includes other causes of abdominal pain, such as appendicitis, intussusception, and Crohn disease. In this case, the history of intermittent abdominal pain, the presence of a pelvic mass on imaging studies, and the finding of calcifications in the wall of the diverticulum are all consistent with a diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum.

Pelvic teratomas are rare tumors that can occur in any age group, but are most common in children and young adults. They are composed of a variety of tissues, including ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Pelvic teratomas can be benign or malignant.

Enteric duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are thought to arise from a duplication of the embryonic gut tube. Enteric duplication cysts can be lined by any type of gastrointestinal epithelium and may contain pancreatic or gastric tissue.

Carcinoid tumors are rare tumors that arise from neuroendocrine cells. They can occur in any part of the body, but are most common in the gastrointestinal tract. Carcinoid tumors are usually benign, but can be malignant.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Meckel diverticulum. The other choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the history, physical examination, and imaging findings in this case.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a blood test that measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. A differential is a test that measures the types of white blood cells. These tests can help to rule out a hematologic disorder, such as leukemia, which can cause oral ulcers.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's oral ulcers. Option A, obtain a biopsy of the ulcer, is not necessary in this case because the patient has a history of recurrent oral ulcers and the physical examination is normal. Option B, prescribe valacyclovir (1000 mg) 3 times daily for the next 7 days, is appropriate for a patient with a herpes simplex virus infection, but the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection, such as fever or lymphadenopathy. Option D, prescribe amoxicillin (500 mg) 3 times daily for the next 7 days, is appropriate for a patient with a bacterial infection, but the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of a bacterial infection, such as fever or purulent drainage.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Order a complete blood cell count with differential to rule out a hematologic disorder.

 86%|████████▌ | 1304/1525 [5:19:39<59:39, 16.20s/it]The correct answer is C. Mixed obstructive and restrictive abnormality.

The patient has a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive disease that causes obstruction of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation, and inspiratory crackles are all consistent with COPD.

The chest x-ray shows hyperinflation and increased interstitial markings. Hyperinflation is an increase in the volume of the lungs, which can occur in COPD. Interstitial markings are lines that can be seen on a chest x-ray, and they can be caused by a variety of conditions, including COPD.

The pulmonary function tests show a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). A decrease in FEV1 and FVC is consistent with obstruction of the airways. The patient's FEV1/FVC ratio is also decreased, which is a further sign of obstruction.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and pulmonary function tests are all consistent with COPD. COPD is a mixed obstructive and restrictive abnormality, which means that it both obstructs the airways and makes it difficult for the lungs to expand.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Primarily restrictive abnormality is incorrect because the patient's FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased, which is a sign of obstruction.
* B. Obstructive abnormality with pseudorestriction is incorrect because the patient's FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased, which is a sign of obstruction.
* D. Spirometry cannot be used to evaluate for obstruction in the setting of a restrictive abnormality is incorrect because the patient's FEV1 and FVC are both decreased, which are signs of obstruction.

 86%|████████▌ | 1305/1525 [5:19:53<56:48, 15.49s/it]The correct answer is D. Do nothing now but repeat CT scan in 3 to 6 months. The patient in this case has Graves' disease, which is a condition that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, which is a condition that causes symptoms such as weight loss, tremor, heat intolerance, and palpitations.

The patient in this case has been started on treatment with methimazole, which is a medication that blocks the production of thyroid hormone. Methimazole is usually effective in treating Graves' disease, and most patients experience a significant improvement in their symptoms within a few weeks of starting treatment.

The CT scan and FDG-PET scan show that the patient has an enlarged thymus gland. The thymus gland is a small organ in the chest that is important for the development of the immune system. In adults, the thymus gland usually shrinks, but it can sometimes enlarge in people with Graves' disease.

An enlarged thymus gland is not usually a cause for concern in people with Graves' disease. In most cases, the thymus gland will shrink back to normal size after treatment with methimazole. However, in rare cases, an enlarged thymus gland can cause problems such as difficulty breathing.

If the patient in this case continues to have symptoms of hyperthyroidism after 3 to 6 months of treatment with methimazole, her doctor may recommend surgery to remove the thymus gland. However, surgery is usually not necessary for people with Graves' disease who are responding well to treatment with methimazole.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, Refer to medical oncology, is incorrect because the patient does not have cancer. Graves' disease is a non-cancerous condition.
* Option B, Perform biopsy of the thymus, is incorrect because a biopsy is not necessary in this case. The CT scan and FDG-PET scan already show that the patient has an enlarged thymus gland.
* Option C, Refer to surgery for removal of the thymus, is incorrect because surgery is usually not necessary for people with Graves' disease who are responding well to treatment with methimazole.

 86%|████████▌ | 1306/1525 [5:20:10<57:37, 15.79s/it]The correct answer is B. Infantile myofibromatosis. The patient is a newborn girl with a nodular lesion on the scalp present since birth. The lesion is firm, exophytic, and flat-topped, with superficial erosion and crust. There is no evidence of visceral involvement. The lesion regressed without treatment over a period of 8 months.

Giant cell fibroblastoma is a benign tumor that usually presents in children under the age of 5. It is characterized by a large, solitary, firm, non-tender mass on the skin or soft tissues. The tumor is usually located on the extremities, but can also occur on the trunk or head and neck. Giant cell fibroblastoma is usually diagnosed based on clinical presentation and imaging studies. A biopsy is usually not necessary, but may be performed to rule out other conditions. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Dermoid cyst is a benign tumor that is derived from embryonic ectoderm. It is the most common type of cyst found in the skin. Dermoid cysts are usually located on the head and neck, but can also occur on the trunk or extremities. They are typically filled with sebum, hair, and keratin. Dermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic, but can become infected or rupture. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Keratoacanthoma is a benign skin tumor that is characterized by a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule. It is usually located on the sun-exposed skin of the face, hands, and arms. Keratoacanthoma is usually self-limited and resolves within 6-12 months. However, it can be difficult to distinguish from a squamous cell carcinoma, so a biopsy is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is infantile myofibromatosis. The patient is a newborn girl with a nodular lesion on the scalp present since birth. The lesion is firm, exophytic, and flat-topped, with superficial erosion and crust. There is no evidence of visceral involvement. The lesion regressed without treatment over a period of 8 months. These features are all consistent with infantile myofibromatosis. Giant cell fibroblastoma, dermoid cyst, and keratoacanthoma are all less likely diagnoses in this patient.

 86%|████████▌ | 1307/1525 [5:20:26<58:26, 16.09s/it]The correct answer is B. Cytomegalovirus ulcer.

The patient is a man in his 60s with a history of heart transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, and plasmablastic lymphoma. He presents with a painless rapidly enlarging ulcer on his left leg. The ulcer is well-demarcated, 5 x 5 cm, and has a raised border, surrounding erythema, and a base with purulent debris. A superficial swab culture sample grew P aeruginosa. A punch biopsy specimen from the edge of the ulcer was obtained and sent for histopathologic evaluation. The biopsy showed enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, and some cytoplasmic inclusions. Similar findings were detected in some macrophages.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) ulcer. CMV is a herpesvirus that can cause a variety of infections in immunocompromised patients, including skin ulcers. The ulcers are typically painless and have a raised border with surrounding erythema. The base of the ulcer may be purulent or necrotic. CMV ulcers can be difficult to treat and often require prolonged antiviral therapy.

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection that is typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is characterized by painful ulcers with a black necrotic center. Ecthyma gangrenosum is more common in patients with hematologic malignancies, diabetes, and AIDS.

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin ulcers, especially in patients with diabetes or other immunosuppressive conditions. Mucormycosis ulcers are typically black and necrotic, and they can rapidly spread to deeper tissues.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a skin condition that is characterized by painful ulcers with a violaceous border. Pyoderma gangrenosum is more common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Behçet's disease.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of CMV ulcer. Ecthyma gangrenosum, mucormycosis, and pyoderma gangrenosum are less likely diagnoses in this patient.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by the presence of neutrophils in the vessel walls. It is typically associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient in this case does not have any of these associated conditions, and the lesions are not consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. These antibodies can cause blood clots to form in the blood vessels, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including purpura. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the lesions on the patient's skin are not consistent with antiphospholipid syndrome.

Purpura fulminans is a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread purpura, fever, and coagulopathy. It is typically caused by infection with Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of purpura fulminans, and the lesions on her skin are not consistent with this condition.

Type I cryoglobulinemia is a condition characterized by the presence of circulating cryoglobulins, which are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold. Cryoglobulinemia can be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including multiple myeloma. The patient in this case has a history of multiple myeloma, and the lesions on her skin are consistent with type I cryoglobulinemia.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma.

 86%|████████▌ | 1309/1525 [5:20:56<56:34, 15.72s/it]The correct answer is D. Treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy.

The patient in this case has bilateral choroidal detachment in the setting of Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the production of a monoclonal protein called IgM. This protein can cause a number of problems, including damage to the blood vessels in the eye, which can lead to choroidal detachment.

Choroidal detachment is a separation of the choroid, the layer of tissue that nourishes the retina, from the sclera, the white of the eye. This can cause a number of symptoms, including blurred vision, pain, and floaters. In some cases, choroidal detachment can lead to retinal detachment, which can be a serious vision-threatening condition.

The treatment for choroidal detachment depends on the cause. In the case of choroidal detachment caused by Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the goal of treatment is to control the underlying disease and to relieve the pressure on the eye. This can be done with a combination of systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy.

Systemic chemotherapy is used to kill the cancer cells that are producing the monoclonal protein. This can help to reduce the amount of protein in the blood and to improve the blood flow to the eye. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This can help to relieve the pressure on the eye and to improve vision.

In the case of this patient, it is important to treat both the choroidal detachment and the underlying Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Treatment with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy is the most likely to achieve a good outcome for this patient.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the choroidal detachment. Option A, observe the patient, is not an appropriate treatment for choroidal detachment. Option B, perform pars plana vitrectomy, is a surgical procedure that can be used to treat choroidal detachment, but it is not the only option. Option C, treat with systemic chemotherapy, is a treatment option for Waldenström macroglobulinemia, but it does not address the choroidal detachment.

 86%|████████▌ | 1310/1525 [5:21:13<56:51, 15.87s/it]The correct answer is C. Photodynamic therapy.

A. Systemic corticosteroid therapy is not indicated for serous retinal detachment. Corticosteroids can cause retinal vasoconstriction, which could worsen the detachment.

B. Observation is not appropriate for serous retinal detachment. The detachment is likely to progress, and permanent vision loss could occur if it is not treated.

C. Photodynamic therapy is the most appropriate treatment for serous retinal detachment. Photodynamic therapy involves injecting a drug into the bloodstream and then shining a special light into the eye. The light activates the drug, which causes it to destroy abnormal blood vessels that are leaking fluid into the retina.

D. Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is another option for treating serous retinal detachment. Anti-VEGF drugs work by blocking the growth of new blood vessels. However, anti-VEGF therapy is not as effective as photodynamic therapy for serous retinal detachment.

In this case, the patient has a serous retinal detachment that involves the macula. The macula is the part of the retina that is responsible for central vision. If the detachment is not treated, it could lead to permanent vision loss. Photodynamic therapy is the most effective treatment for serous retinal detachment. It is safe and effective, and it has a high success rate.

 86%|████████▌ | 1311/1525 [5:21:25<52:52, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is B. Lymphatic malformation.

A retroperitoneal abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the space behind the abdominal organs. It is usually caused by an infection, such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. Symptoms of a retroperitoneal abscess include fever, chills, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and surgery to drain the abscess.

A urinoma is a collection of urine that forms outside of the urinary tract. It can be caused by an injury to the urinary tract, such as a kidney stone or a bladder rupture. Symptoms of a urinoma include fever, chills, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting. Treatment usually involves surgery to drain the urinoma.

A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of fluid that forms in the pancreas. It is usually caused by pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. Symptoms of a pancreatic pseudocyst include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and fever. Treatment usually involves surgery to drain the pseudocyst.

In the case of the adolescent girl, the most likely diagnosis is a lymphatic malformation. Lymphatic malformations are abnormal collections of lymphatic tissue that can occur anywhere in the body. They are usually benign, but they can sometimes cause problems if they grow large enough to compress or obstruct nearby organs. Symptoms of a lymphatic malformation can vary depending on the size and location of the malformation. Common symptoms include swelling, pain, and infection. Treatment for a lymphatic malformation depends on the size, location, and symptoms of the malformation. Some lymphatic malformations may resolve on their own, while others may require surgery to remove or drain the malformation.

The patient in the case presented with abdominal distention, which is a common symptom of lymphatic malformations. The abdominal radiograph showed a paucity of bowel gas markings, which is a sign of obstruction. The abdominal computed tomographic scan showed a 30-cm retroperitoneal cystic structure causing significant mass effect on the abdominal viscera, displacing the right kidney superiorly under the liver causing moderate hydronephrosis. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of lymphatic malformation.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on the abdominal radiograph and computed tomographic scan. A retroperitoneal abscess would not cause abdominal distention or a paucity of bowel gas markings. A urinoma would not cause abdominal distention or a paucity of bowel gas markings, and it would not displace the right kidney superiorly under the liver. A pancreatic pseudocyst would not cause abdominal distention or a paucity of bowel gas markings, and it would not displace the right kidney superiorly under the liver.

 86%|████████▌ | 1312/1525 [5:21:41<54:11, 15.27s/it]The correct answer is D. Fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient has a 6-month history of right-sided nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. He had no clinically significant improvement in symptoms despite multiple courses of oral antibiotics. Over the previous 2 months, he had developed progressive right-sided facial swelling, pain, blurred vision, and a 6.8-kg weight loss. There was no history of immunocompromise or foreign travel. A computed tomographic (CT) scan at an outside hospital showed complete opacification and an invasive process centered in the right maxillary sinus. An endoscopic maxillary antrostomy and biopsy showed inflammatory changes and numerous fungal organisms consistent with Aspergillus species. The patient was started on treatment with intravenous antifungal and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and he was transferred for further evaluation and management. The patient’s examination was notable for right-sided facial and periorbital swelling, severe pain, and limitation of lateral gaze of the right eye. A repeated CT scan was completed.

The CT scan showed near-complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with soft-tissue thickening, a calcific focus, and associated erosion of the bony walls. The findings are consistent with a fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

A fungal ball is a mass of fungal hyphae that forms in a sinus cavity. It is usually caused by Aspergillus species, which are common in the environment. Fungal balls are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms if they become large or if they block the sinus drainage pathway. Symptoms of a fungal ball can include nasal congestion, facial pain, and headache.

Invasive squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells that line the sinuses. It is the most common type of cancer that affects the sinuses. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma is usually caused by exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke. Symptoms of invasive squamous cell carcinoma can include nasal congestion, facial pain, and headache.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with both a fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scan findings are also consistent with both conditions. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect. A fungal ball is not a type of cancer. Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is a type of fungal infection that can cause chronic inflammation and destruction of the sinuses. It is not typically associated with facial pain or blurred vision. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can cause facial pain and blurred vision, but it is not typically associated with a history of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is usually found in the skin or mucous membranes. It is not likely to cause any symptoms, but it can sometimes bleed or cause pain.

A schwannoma is a benign tumor of Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and protect nerve fibers. It is most commonly found in the peripheral nerves, but it can also occur in the brain and spinal cord. It is usually not cancerous, but it can grow large enough to cause pressure on nearby structures.

A laryngocele is a sac-like protrusion of the mucous membrane lining the larynx. It is usually caused by a weakness in the wall of the larynx. It is usually not cancerous, but it can cause hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and a feeling of fullness in the throat.

The patient in this case has a well-circumscribed mass of approximately 3 × 3 × 2 cm, with a smooth surface, located at the laryngeal side of the left aryepiglottic fold and covering nearby structures, such as the bilateral vocal cords and left pyriform sinus. The tumor was at the submucosa with focally ulcerated overlying epithelium. It was composed of adipocytes of various sizes in a fibromyxoid background. In the fibromyxoid areas, atypical spindle cells with hyperchromatic and enlarged nuclei were present, as well as scattered lipoblasts without areas of dedifferentiation. Immunohistochemically, the tumor exhibited substantial nuclear staining for both CDK4 and MDM2 and stains.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx. Well-differentiated liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from fat cells. It is usually found in the abdomen, but it can also occur in the larynx. It is a slow-growing cancer, and it is usually not life-threatening. However, it can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

 86%|████████▌ | 1314/1525 [5:22:14<55:51, 15.88s/it]The correct answer is B. Venous malformation.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, accounting for about 5% of all childhood cancers. Rhabdomyosarcoma typically presents as a rapidly growing mass in the extremities, trunk, or head and neck. On imaging studies, rhabdomyosarcomas are typically heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images and show avid enhancement with gadolinium contrast.

Masticator space abscess is a collection of pus within the masticator space, a region of the face that contains the muscles of mastication (chewing). Masticator space abscesses are typically caused by infection of the teeth or gums, and can spread to the other structures within the masticator space, including the parotid gland, temporalis muscle, and pterygoid muscles. On imaging studies, masticator space abscesses are typically T2 hyperintense and show rim enhancement with gadolinium contrast.

Chronic hematoma is a collection of blood that has been clotted and has been present for at least 2 weeks. Chronic hematomas are typically caused by trauma, and can occur in any part of the body. On imaging studies, chronic hematomas are typically T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense. They may show rim enhancement with gadolinium contrast.

The patient in the case presented with a well-defined, lobulated T2 hyperintense lesion within the right pterygoid muscles without mass effect, adjacent edema, or other invasive features. On gadolinium administration, there was sequential increased enhancement on the postcontrast T1-weighted axial images. Further imaging workup with single-proton emission computed tomography-CT (SPECT-CT) using technetium Tc 99m–labeled red blood cells (RBCs) demonstrated increased tracer pooling within the lesion. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of venous malformation.

Venous malformations are abnormal collections of veins that are present at birth. They are typically benign (noncancerous) and do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms, such as pain, bleeding, or disfigurement. Venous malformations can be treated with surgery, embolization, or sclerotherapy.

Rhabdomyosarcoma, masticator space abscess, and chronic hematoma are all potential diagnoses in this case, but the findings on imaging studies are most consistent with a diagnosis of venous malformation.

Paragangliomas are rare tumors that arise from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that produce hormones. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, but can also occur in the abdomen and pelvis. Paragangliomas are usually benign (noncancerous), but can be malignant (cancerous).

Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common type of cancer that starts in the skin. They can also occur in the lining of the esophagus, stomach, intestines, lungs, bladder, cervix, and other organs. Squamous cell carcinomas are usually malignant (cancerous).

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, heart, and kidneys. It is caused by the accumulation of abnormal immune cells in the affected tissues. Sarcoidosis is usually not life-threatening, but can cause significant health problems.

The patient in the case presented with a right pyriform sinus mass that was seen on fiber-optic laryngoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the finding of a hypopharyngeal mass. The patient underwent an endoscopic laser excision. Immunohistochemical stains revealed tumor cells that were focally positive for myogenin and diffusely positive for desmin and myoglobin. An MRI scan obtained 1 month postoperatively demonstrated a persistent mass or swelling. The patient continued to experience dysphagia, globus, and a choking sensation when coughing. On fiber-optic examination, right pyriform sinus fullness was visualized. During operative laryngoscopy, no mass was identified. An interval MRI demonstrated a 2-cm soft-tissue mass in the cervical esophagus. Using rigid suspension laryngoscopy, we identified a large, smooth-walled ovoid mass herniating from the cervical esophageal opening. A mucosal stalk anchored the mass to the lateral pyriform sinus wall. Endoscopic snare cautery was used to excise the mass. The tumor was well-defined, solitary, tan-red, and composed of sheets of large, round-to-polygonal cells with marked eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Most tumor cells exhibited peripherally or centrally located vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Peripheral intracellular vacuoles indenting the cytoplasm were seen, which represent a processing artifact due to intracellular glycogen loss.

The histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of adult rhabdomyoma. Adult rhabdomyomas are rare, benign tumors that most commonly occur in the heart and skeletal muscles. They can also occur in the head and neck, including the larynx. Adult rhabdomyomas are composed of mature skeletal muscle cells that are arranged in a variety of patterns. The cells typically have eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Adult rhabdomyomas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, hoarseness, and airway obstruction. Treatment for adult rhabdomyomas is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients experiencing long-term remission.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Paragangliomas are not typically found in the larynx.
* Squamous cell carcinomas are not typically associated with eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli.
* Sarcoidosis is not typically associated with a well-defined, solitary mass.

Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor of salivary glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor, accounting for about 70% of all cases. Pleomorphic adenomas are typically slow-growing and non-cancerous. However, they can occasionally become malignant.

Fibrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of connective tissue. It is a rare tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers. Fibrosarcomas are typically aggressive tumors that can spread to other parts of the body.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of muscle tissue. It is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children. Rhabdomyosarcomas are typically aggressive tumors that can spread to other parts of the body.

The patient in this case presents with a facial mass that has been growing over 1 year. The mass is firm, mildly tender, but without overlying skin changes or cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans show maxillary sinus compression with partial destruction of the zygomatic arch, mandible, and orbital floor. The mass extends into the right pterygopalatine fossa, disrupting the floor of the middle cranial fossa and widening the foramen ovale. A core biopsy specimen revealed spindle cell proliferation with abundant collagen that stained focally with CD34, smooth muscle actin, and Bcl-2. The histopathologic findings demonstrated spindle cells arranged in long fascicles with abundant interstitial collagen. Tumor cells exhibited central, oval nuclei, and moderate amounts of pale-pink cytoplasm with indistinct borders. There was no increased or atypical mitosis, necrosis, or vascular invasion. Immunostaining demonstrated strong nuclear staining for β-catenin antibody and was positive for smooth muscle actin antibody, while stains for desmin, pan-keratin, S-100, CD34, and Bcl-2 antibodies were negative. The Ki67 index was less than 1%.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive mesenchymal tumors that are typically seen in young adults. They are often associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a genetic disorder that predisposes to colon cancer. Desmoid tumors are typically slow-growing and non-metastatic, but they can locally invade adjacent structures. Treatment is typically surgical resection, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be used.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic findings of the patient in this case. Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor of salivary glands, and it would not be expected to cause the patient's symptoms. Fibrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of connective tissue, and it would be expected to be more aggressive than the patient's tumor. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of muscle tissue, and it would be expected to occur in children, not adults.

Adrenal myelolipomas are rare, benign tumors that are composed of a mixture of fat, bone marrow, and hematopoietic elements. They are typically asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, mass effect, or hormonal abnormalities.

The diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. These studies typically show a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous mass with areas of fat, soft tissue, and calcification. Laboratory studies are typically normal, although serum levels of catecholamines and cortisol may be elevated in some cases.

The treatment of adrenal myelolipomas is typically surgical resection. However, small, asymptomatic tumors can be observed without treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Adrenal liposarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that is composed of fat cells. It is typically diagnosed in older adults and is often associated with pain, fever, and weight loss.
* Renal hamartoma is a benign tumor that is composed of abnormal tissue from the kidney. It is typically diagnosed in children and young adults and is often associated with hematuria (blood in the urine) and hypertension.

A gastric duplication is a rare congenital anomaly that is thought to occur when there is an abnormal budding of the foregut during embryogenesis. It is characterized by a tubular or saccular structure that is lined with gastric mucosa and is located within the stomach or adjacent to it. Gastric duplications can be present at birth or may not be diagnosed until later in life. They are often asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and bleeding.

The imaging findings in this case are consistent with a gastric duplication. The CT scan shows a heterogeneous mass lesion in the fundus and body of the stomach. The upper endoscopy image shows a mass intruding into the lumen of the stomach. The biopsy results of the mass were reported as normal gastric mucosa.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of smooth muscle origin. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal tumor that can arise from the gastrointestinal tract. Pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of fluid that forms in the pancreas.

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of open-angle glaucoma in her right eye. She presents with longer, thicker eyelashes on the right side compared with the left. Her irises are also different colors: the right iris is brown, and the left is hazel (green-brown). The patient has noticed a gradual darkening of her right iris and lengthening of her eyelashes during the last year but denied visual changes or foreign-body sensation. Her medical history includes a cerebrovascular accident, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension and a remote history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Her medications include bimatoprost, atenolol, atorvastatin, and clopidogrel.

The most likely cause of the patient's iris heterochromia and eyelash hypertrichosis is a benign condition called nevus of Ota. Nevi of Ota are congenital, melanocytic hamartomas that typically present as unilateral, slate-gray or blue-brown macules or patches involving the periocular area, including the iris. They are often associated with ipsilateral hypertrichosis of the eyelashes and eyebrows. Nevi of Ota are usually asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause cosmetic concerns or visual problems if they involve the iris.

In the absence of any other symptoms or signs, there is no need to perform any further tests or refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. The patient should be reassured that her condition is benign and does not require any treatment. She should be advised to see an ophthalmologist if she develops any new symptoms, such as visual changes or foreign-body sensation.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform eye and orbit computed tomography (CT): This is not necessary in the absence of any other symptoms or signs.
* B. Order serologic studies including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody titers (ANA), complete blood cell count (CBC), and basic chemistry panel: These tests are not necessary to diagnose nevus of Ota.

A topical corticosteroid is a medication that is applied to the skin to reduce inflammation. It is not the best treatment for this patient because he has systemic symptoms, including weight loss, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, subjective fevers, night sweats, and painful hematuria. These symptoms suggest that he has an underlying systemic disease, such as an infection or cancer. A biopsy of the skin lesion would be the best way to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Oral antibiotics are not the best treatment for this patient because he does not have any signs or symptoms of an infection. A biopsy of the skin lesion would be the best way to determine if he has an infection.

Respiratory isolation and ruling out tuberculosis are not the best treatments for this patient because he does not have any respiratory symptoms. A biopsy of the skin lesion would be the best way to determine if he has tuberculosis.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with androgen deficiency, but his total testosterone level is within the normal range. This suggests that he may have a condition called hypogonadism, which is characterized by low levels of free testosterone. Free testosterone is the biologically active form of testosterone, and it is the form that is responsible for the symptoms of androgen deficiency.

To confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism, it is necessary to measure the patient's free testosterone level. If the free testosterone level is low, then the patient may be treated with testosterone replacement therapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: The patient does not have clinical features of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, such as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, or infertility. Therefore, there is no need to measure gonadotropins.
* Choice B: Repeating the total testosterone measurement using an immunoassay will not provide any additional information, as the patient's total testosterone level is already within the normal range.
* Choice D: The patient's symptoms are consistent with androgen deficiency, and his total testosterone level is within the normal range. Therefore, it is premature to conclude that the patient does not have androgen deficiency. Further evaluation is required, including measurement of free testosterone.

The patient is a woman in her 70s with a medical history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, and neuropathy. She was admitted to the hospital with a 6-day history of painful lesions involving both ears. Initially, the left ear developed very painful lesions that resembled bruises. Subsequently, her right ear became involved and developed similar lesions, but she denied any other areas being affected. She had recently been treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin. The lesions appeared while she was taking levofloxacin; however, on admission the antibiotic therapy was continued. Her other medications included propylthiouracil, amlodipine besylate, pravastatin sodium, solifenacin succinate, and gabapentin. On physical examination, the patient had localized retiform purpura on the right earlobe and bilateral helices that were tender to palpation. Findings from laboratory tests, including a hypercoagulability workup, complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, cryoglobulins, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and complement levels were all unremarkable. However, the test result for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs) was positive. A punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed.

The histopathologic examination revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrin thrombi. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of small vessel vasculitis characterized by the presence of neutrophils, fibrin thrombi, and necrotic debris in the walls of small blood vessels. It is a common finding in hypersensitivity vasculitis, which is a type of allergic reaction that can occur in response to a variety of drugs, including propylthiouracil.

The patient's history of taking propylthiouracil, the temporal relationship between the onset of her lesions and the initiation of propylthiouracil therapy, the positive p-ANCA test result, and the histopathologic findings all support the diagnosis of propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Levamisole-induced vasculopathy is a rare side effect of levamisole, a drug that is used to treat parasitic infections. It is characterized by the presence of small vessel vasculitis, often with a leukocytoclastic appearance. However, the patient in this case was not taking levamisole.
* Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. Cryoglobulins are proteins that precipitate in the cold. Mixed cryoglobulinemia can cause a variety of symptoms, including vasculitis, purpura, arthralgia, and Raynaud's phenomenon. However, the patient in this case did not have any of the typical symptoms of mixed cryoglobulinemia.
* Septic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is caused by an infection. It is characterized by the presence of inflammation and necrosis in the walls of small blood vessels. Septic vasculitis can occur in a variety of settings, including infective endocarditis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections. However, the patient in this case did not have any evidence of an infection.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by inflammation of small- and medium-sized arteries. The most common symptoms are fever, weight loss, and muscle pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, skin lesions, and neurological problems. PAN can be life-threatening, and treatment typically involves high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a number of features that are consistent with PAN. The stellate red-brown patches on the distal extremities are a classic finding of PAN. These lesions are caused by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin. The patient also has a history of atopy, which is a risk factor for PAN. Additionally, the patient has muscle cramping and numbness, which can be caused by damage to the arteries in the muscles.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by inflammation of small- and medium-sized arteries and veins. The most common symptoms are fever, weight loss, and cough. Other symptoms may include sinusitis, skin lesions, and eye problems. GPA can be life-threatening, and treatment typically involves high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the classic symptoms of GPA.
* Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by inflammation of small arteries and capillaries. The most common symptoms are fever, weight loss, and cough. Other symptoms may include glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidneys), skin lesions, and neurological problems. MPA can be life-threatening, and treatment typically involves high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the classic symptoms of MPA.
* Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin. The most common symptoms are purpura (purple spots on the skin), arthralgia (pain in the joints), and fever. LCV is not a systemic vasculitis, and it is typically not life-threatening. The patient in the case presentation does have purpura, but she also has other symptoms that are more consistent with a systemic vasculitis such as PAN.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Polyarteritis nodosa. The patient in the case presentation presents with a number of features that are consistent with PAN, including stellate red-brown patches on the distal extremities, a history of atopy, and muscle cramping and numbness. The other answer choices are incorrect for the reasons discussed above.

A basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the basal cells, which are the cells that make up the outermost layer of skin. Basal cell carcinomas are the most common type of skin cancer, and they are usually not life-threatening. However, if they are not treated, they can grow and spread to other parts of the body.

A congenital nevus is a type of birthmark that is present at birth. Congenital nevi can be small or large, and they can be flat or raised. Most congenital nevi are harmless, but some can develop into melanoma, a type of skin cancer.

A seborrheic keratosis is a common skin growth that is usually harmless. Seborrheic keratoses can be found on any part of the body, but they are most common on the scalp, face, and chest. They are typically brown or black, and they can be flat or raised.

The patient in the case presented with a lesion that had slowly enlarged over the preceding 5 years. This is a characteristic of an apocrine poroma, which is a benign skin tumor that arises from the apocrine sweat glands. Apocrine poromas are typically small, solitary lesions that are located on the scalp, face, or axillae. They are often described as being dome-shaped or pedunculated, and they may have a central umbilication. Histologically, apocrine poromas are characterized by a proliferation of apocrine glandular epithelium.

The patient in the case also presented with a dermoscopic appearance of irregular pigment globules, milialike cysts, and focal arborizing vessels. These features are also characteristic of apocrine poromas.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and dermoscopic findings, the most likely diagnosis is apocrine poroma. The other choices are less likely based on the patient's presentation.

The patient has a 4.5 × 3.0-mm bluish black flat lesion on the sclera (Figure, C). Results of a dilated fundus examination showed a grayish black, minimally elevated choroidal lesion with surrounding retinal pigment epithelial atrophy but without subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, or hard exudates. This is consistent with a scar from the previous iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy.

Repeat iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is not indicated because the lesion is a scar and not a new tumor. External beam radiotherapy is not indicated because the lesion is a scar and not a new tumor. Enucleation is not indicated because the lesion is a scar and not a new tumor.

Observation is the correct management because the lesion is a scar and not a new tumor. The patient should be monitored with regular eye examinations to ensure that the lesion does not change.

Chloroquine is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. However, chloroquine can also cause a condition called chloroquine retinopathy, which is a damage to the retina that can lead to vision loss.

The patient in the case study has a history of taking chloroquine for 7 years, and he has developed bilateral, painless, progressive visual diminution. On examination, he has bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts and a hypopigmented zone in the parafoveal macula. Color vision testing revealed red-green deficiencies in both eyes.

These findings are consistent with chloroquine retinopathy. The patient should be advised to discontinue chloroquine treatment immediately. There is no known treatment for chloroquine retinopathy, but discontinuing treatment may halt the progression of the disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Reassure and observe: This is not an appropriate management option for a patient with chloroquine retinopathy. The patient should be advised to discontinue chloroquine treatment immediately.
* C. Treat with intravitreous corticosteroids: This is not an effective treatment for chloroquine retinopathy.

Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune disease that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin, most commonly on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Psoriasis is not contagious and is not life-threatening, but it can be very itchy and disfiguring. There is no cure for psoriasis, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms.

Ichthyosis is a group of genetic skin disorders characterized by dry, thick, scaly skin. There are many different types of ichthyosis, with varying severity. Some people with ichthyosis may have only mild symptoms, while others may have severe skin problems that require lifelong treatment. There is no cure for ichthyosis, but there are treatments that can help to improve the symptoms.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that causes dry, itchy skin. It is often associated with other allergic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. Atopic dermatitis is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. There is no cure for atopic dermatitis, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms.

The patient in the case presentation has a well-defined, follicular, pink, scaly rash on her elbows, knees, hands, and feet. She also has diffuse, marked orange-red hyperkeratosis and hyperlinearity of her palms with clear demarcation at the wrists. These findings are characteristic of circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP). PRP is a rare, chronic skin condition that is characterized by a sudden onset of well-defined, follicular, pink, scaly patches on the skin. The patches are often pruritic (itchy) and may be associated with hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin) and hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin). PRP is most common in children and young adults, but it can occur at any age. The cause of PRP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no cure for PRP, but the symptoms can be treated with topical corticosteroids, retinoids, and other medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation. Psoriasis is characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin, most commonly on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.

NASP is a rare, soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in the head and neck, particularly the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is a highly vascular tumor that can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. On imaging, NASP typically appears as a well-circumscribed mass with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI. Histologically, NASP is characterized by a proliferation of epithelioid and polygonal cells with pale eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and relatively uniform vesicular nuclei. The tumor cells typically stain positive for smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, Bcl-2, INI-1, and transcription factor E3.

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a rare, soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is a highly aggressive tumor that can metastasize to distant sites. ARMS is typically found in the extremities, but can also occur in the head and neck. On imaging, ARMS typically appears as a poorly defined mass with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI. Histologically, ARMS is characterized by a proliferation of small, round, blue cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. The tumor cells typically stain positive for desmin, myogenin, and actin.

Malignant melanoma is a rare, but aggressive form of skin cancer. It can arise from melanocytes in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes. Malignant melanoma is typically found on the skin, but can also occur in the head and neck. On imaging, malignant melanoma typically appears as a nodular mass with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI. Histologically, malignant melanoma is characterized by a proliferation of atypical melanocytes with pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells typically stain positive for S-100 protein and Melan-A.

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in adolescent boys. It is a highly vascular tumor that can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. On imaging, JNA typically appears as a lobulated mass with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI. Histologically, JNA is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells with abundant vascularity. The tumor cells typically stain positive for CD34 and smooth muscle actin.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma. NASP is a rare, but aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in the head and neck. It is a highly vascular tumor that can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the head, neck, and extremities. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, accounting for about 30% of all cases.

The most common presenting symptom of rhabdomyosarcoma is a painless mass. Other symptoms may include pain, swelling, fever, and lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma is made with a biopsy. The treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma depends on the stage of the disease, but may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The prognosis for children with rhabdomyosarcoma has improved significantly in recent years. The 5-year survival rate for children with localized disease is now over 70%.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic neuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that usually occurs in infants and young children. It is not the most common cause of a painless mass in the head and neck.
* Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is not the most common cause of a painless mass in the head and neck.
* Lipoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that is made of fat. It is not the most common cause of a painless mass in the head and neck.

 87%|████████▋ | 1331/1525 [5:26:35<50:02, 15.47s/it]The correct diagnosis is chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNCH), also known as Winkler's disease. This is a chronic, painful, nodular skin condition that affects the helix of the ear. It is most common in men in their 40s and 50s, and is thought to be caused by chronic irritation and trauma to the ear.

The typical presentation of CNCH is a small, painful nodule on the helix of the ear. The nodule is usually dome-shaped and firm, and may have a central crust or ulcer. The skin around the nodule may be red and inflamed. CNCH can be unilateral or bilateral, and is usually not associated with other systemic symptoms.

The diagnosis of CNCH is usually made based on the clinical presentation and a biopsy of the nodule. The biopsy will show characteristic features of CNCH, including a thickened epidermis, a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and degeneration of the underlying cartilage.

There is no cure for CNCH, but treatment can help to relieve symptoms and prevent recurrence. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral steroids, and surgery. Topical steroids are the most common treatment for CNCH, and are usually effective in relieving pain and inflammation. Oral steroids may be used if topical steroids are not effective, or if the patient has severe symptoms. Surgery is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to other treatments, or who have a large or ulcerated nodule.

The prognosis for CNCH is generally good. With treatment, most patients experience significant improvement in their symptoms. However, CNCH is a chronic condition, and there is a risk of recurrence.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Keratoacanthoma is a rare, fast-growing skin cancer that can occur on any part of the body, but is most common on the sun-exposed skin of the face, ears, and hands. Keratoacanthomas are typically dome-shaped, red, and crusted lesions that can grow to be several centimeters in diameter. They are usually painless, but can be tender if they become infected. Keratoacanthomas are usually self-limiting and resolve within a few months, but they can also be surgically removed.
* Glomus tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the glomus bodies, which are small, specialized sensory organs that are found in the skin, especially in the hands and feet. Glomus tumors are typically small, painful, red nodules that occur on the fingers or toes. They can also occur on the ears, nose, and lips. Glomus tumors are usually treated with surgery.
* Rheumatoid nodule is a type of nodule that is associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are typically small, firm, subcutaneous nodules that occur over bony prominences, such as the elbows, knees, and hands. They can also occur on the ears, scalp, and other areas of the body. Rheumatoid nodules are usually not painful, but they can be tender. They are usually treated with medications that suppress the immune system.

Osteolipoma is a rare benign tumor that is composed of both bone and fat. It is typically found in the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region. Osteolipomas are usually asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally grow large enough to cause pain or pressure symptoms.

The diagnosis of osteolipoma is made on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. Imaging studies typically show a well-defined, lobulated mass that is composed of both fat and bone. Biopsy shows a mixture of mature adipose tissue and mature bone.

Osteolipomas are typically treated by surgical excision. However, they are rarely malignant and do not require treatment unless they are symptomatic.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy findings in this case.

* Myositis ossificans is a benign condition that is characterized by the formation of bone within skeletal muscle. It is typically caused by trauma to the muscle, and it is usually self-limiting.
* Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of fat cells. It is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma, and it is typically found in the extremities.

The patient is a previously healthy woman in her 50s who presented with complaints of increasing forgetfulness, fatigue, and depressed mood after dealing with the deaths of several close relatives. She was diagnosed with depression and began treatment with antidepressant medication. After 8 months, she had worsening complaints. At that time, a family member reported that her memory problems had progressed. She was no longer able to find misplaced objects, remember appointments, or handle financial affairs. She was often subdued, her mood depressed, and her sleeping time increased. Clinical examination at that time revealed a flattened affect and a 22 of 30 Mini-Mental State Examination score. Findings were otherwise normal, and there were no focal neurologic deficits. Basic laboratory workup results were unremarkable. She was referred to a neurologist, who ordered contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The MRI (Figure) revealed extensive ill-defined areas of FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) and T2 signal abnormalities with additional enhancing nodular foci located within deep white matter structures, the basal ganglia, the caudate, the pons, and the midbrain. Also identified was enhancement of the interpeduncular cistern and cerebral peduncles, suggestive of leptomeningeal involvement.

The patient's history and clinical presentation are consistent with PCNSL. PCNSL is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that arises in the central nervous system (CNS). It is most common in elderly patients with underlying immune suppression, such as those with HIV infection or organ transplant recipients. However, it can also occur in immunocompetent patients, such as the patient in this case.

The diagnosis of PCNSL is made on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy. The MRI findings in PCNSL are characteristic, with multiple, ill-defined areas of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity with contrast enhancement. These findings can be difficult to distinguish from other CNS neoplasms, such as glioblastoma multiforme, metastases, and demyelinating diseases. However, the presence of leptomeningeal involvement is highly suggestive of PCNSL.

The treatment of PCNSL is aggressive, with the goal of achieving a complete remission. Treatment typically consists of a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of only 1-2 years. However, with aggressive treatment, some patients can achieve long-term remission.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Inflammatory demyelinating processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are a group of autoimmune disorders that cause inflammation and demyelination of the CNS. MS is typically diagnosed in young adults, and it is more common in women than men. The clinical presentation of MS is variable, but it can include symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, numbness, tingling, vision problems, and problems with balance and coordination. MS is not a neoplasm, and it does not typically cause leptomeningeal involvement.
* B. Neoplasms such as multicentric glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, and metastases are all malignant tumors that can arise in the CNS. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common type of primary brain tumor, and it is typically seen in older adults. Metastases to the CNS are most common in patients with cancer of the lung, breast, or colon. Neoplasms can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their location and size. However, they typically do not cause the diffuse, multifocal lesions seen in the patient in this case.
* C. Infectious causes including tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, and toxoplasmosis are all infections that can affect the CNS. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and abscesses in the CNS. Neurosyphilis is a late complication of syphilis that can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and stroke. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. Infectious diseases can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the specific infection. However, they typically do not cause the diffuse, multifocal lesions seen in the patient in this case.

 87%|████████▋ | 1334/1525 [5:27:25<51:16, 16.11s/it]The correct answer is D. Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst.

The patient's symptoms of episodic numbness and paresthesias in both feet, with symptom-free intervals between episodes, are consistent with a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst. These cysts are typically located in the thoracic spine and can cause compression of the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as numbness, paresthesias, weakness, and bladder and bowel dysfunction.

The patient's symptoms were prominent after activity and reliably triggered by straining with urination and terminated by lying supine. This is also consistent with a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst, as these cysts can be exacerbated by increased intra-abdominal pressure.

The patient also reported a 1-week history of urinary retention requiring intermittent self-catheterization. This is a serious complication of spinal cord compression and can lead to permanent bladder dysfunction if not treated.

A thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging scan with fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) sequences was obtained. This scan revealed a blurry spinal cord signal alteration at the T7-T8 level with deformation of the cord posteriorly. This is a classic finding in spinal extradural arachnoid cysts.

A dynamic computed tomographic myelogram demonstrated a lesion compressing the dorsal spinal cord at the T7 level. This is further evidence of spinal extradural arachnoid cyst, as these cysts can often be seen on myelography.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is spinal extradural arachnoid cyst.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation is a rare condition that is typically caused by trauma or a tumor. It is not likely in this case, as the patient has no history of trauma and there is no evidence of a tumor on imaging.
* Malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord is a serious condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, including numbness, paresthesias, weakness, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. However, it is not likely in this case, as the patient is young and has no history of cancer.
* Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is a rare condition that is caused by an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein in the spinal cord. It can cause symptoms similar to those of a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst, but it is not likely in this case, as the patient has no history of trauma or cancer.

Acute cholecystitis is a common condition characterized by inflammation of the gallbladder. It is typically caused by gallstones, which can block the cystic duct and lead to infection. The patient in this case does not have a history of gallstones, and her laboratory tests do not show any evidence of infection.

Gallbladder cancer is a rare but serious condition that can develop from chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for gallbladder cancer, and her CT scan does not show any evidence of a mass.

Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is a benign condition characterized by the growth of abnormal tissue in the gallbladder wall. It is typically asymptomatic, but it can sometimes cause pain and other symptoms. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of adenomyomatosis, and her CT scan does not show any evidence of the condition.

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of foamy macrophages in the gallbladder wall. It is typically caused by chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, and it can be associated with gallstones, infection, and other conditions. The patient in this case has several risk factors for xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, including her age, her history of hypertension, and her gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her CT scan shows a soft-tissue mass associated with the fundus of the gallbladder, which is a characteristic finding of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.

A D-dimer test is a blood test that measures the levels of D-dimer in the blood. D-dimers are small protein fragments that are produced when a blood clot breaks down. A high level of D-dimers in the blood can be a sign of a pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage of a blood vessel in the lung.

However, a positive D-dimer test does not always mean that a person has a PE. There are many other conditions that can cause a high level of D-dimers in the blood, such as cancer, inflammation, and recent surgery.

The age-adjusted cutoff for D-dimer testing is based on the patient's age. A positive D-dimer test result that is below the patient's age-adjusted cutoff is not considered to be a reliable indicator of a PE.

In this case, the patient's D-dimer test result was positive but below her age-adjusted cutoff. This means that the test result is not reliable and does not indicate that she has a PE. The attending physician should consider other factors, such as the patient's clinical history and symptoms, before making a diagnosis of PE.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: D-dimer test result is positive. Imaging test is required. This is incorrect because a positive D-dimer test result does not always mean that a person has a PE. Imaging tests, such as a CT scan or pulmonary angiogram, are needed to confirm a diagnosis of PE.
* Choice B: D-dimer test result is positive. The diagnosis of PE is confirmed. This is incorrect because a positive D-dimer test result does not always mean that a person has a PE. Imaging tests, such as a CT scan or pulmonary angiogram, are needed to confirm a diagnosis of PE.
* Choice D: D-dimer test result is positive due to active malignancy. PE is ruled out. This is incorrect because a positive D-dimer test result can be caused by many things, including cancer. Imaging tests, such as a CT scan or pulmonary angiogram, are needed to confirm a diagnosis of PE.

 88%|████████▊ | 1337/1525 [5:28:07<46:28, 14.83s/it]The correct answer is C: Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity.

The patient is a 15-year-old obese girl who presented to clinic with increasing right shin pain of 4 weeks’ duration. The pain began after the patient began to play competitive basketball and was localized to her mid shin. Dietary and menstrual histories revealed no abnormalities. Examination demonstrated focal tenderness along the distal mid shaft of the tibia anteriorly. The single-leg hop test elicited severe localized pain. Radiographs were obtained for further evaluation, which showed a stress fracture of the tibia.

A stress fracture is a small crack in a bone that occurs due to repetitive stress. It is most common in the lower extremities, especially the tibia. Stress fractures are often seen in athletes who participate in activities that involve repetitive impact, such as running and jumping.

The treatment for a stress fracture is rest and immobilization. The patient should avoid putting weight on the affected leg for several weeks. In some cases, a cast or splint may be necessary. Pain medication may also be prescribed.

The patient in this case should be ordered immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity. This will allow the fracture to heal properly. The patient should also be instructed to avoid activities that cause pain. Pain medication may be prescribed to help manage the pain.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: Obtain laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities is incorrect because the patient's dietary and menstrual histories revealed no abnormalities.
* Choice B: Refer for immediate surgery is incorrect because the patient has a stress fracture, which is not a surgical condition.
* Choice D: Order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) is incorrect because the patient should be immobilized with non–weight-bearing activity.

ANCA are antibodies that attack the cells in the body's immune system. They are found in the blood of people with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and microscopic polyangiitis. These diseases can cause inflammation and damage to the blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, and other organs.

In the case of the patient with bronchiectasis, the presence of ANCA would suggest that he has one of these autoimmune diseases. Obtaining ANCA titers would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Obtaining blood cultures and empirically treating with intravenous vancomycin is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection, and there is no evidence of sepsis.
* Option B: Performing a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treating with valacyclovir is also not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms of a viral infection, and there is no evidence of herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus infection.
* Option D: Starting a high-potency topical steroid is not necessary in this case. The patient's rash is not severe, and there is no evidence of an allergic reaction.

 88%|████████▊ | 1339/1525 [5:28:31<42:21, 13.66s/it]The correct answer is D. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, heart, liver, spleen, and other organs. It is most common in African Americans and people of Scandinavian descent. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on clinical findings, imaging studies, and biopsy results. Treatment is generally not necessary for asymptomatic patients. However, patients with symptomatic sarcoidosis may be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by a series of stages, including primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis. Primary syphilis is characterized by the appearance of a single chancre, which is a painless ulcer that typically appears on the genitals. Secondary syphilis is characterized by a generalized rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise. Latent syphilis is a stage of the disease in which there are no symptoms. Tertiary syphilis is a late stage of the disease that can cause serious damage to the heart, brain, and other organs.

Indeterminate cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of indeterminate cells in the skin. Indeterminate cells are a type of white blood cell that is not associated with any other known disease. The diagnosis of indeterminate cell histiocytosis is made based on the appearance of indeterminate cells on a skin biopsy. Treatment is generally not necessary, as the condition usually resolves on its own. However, some patients may require treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. It is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal T-cells. The diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is made based on the results of a blood test, a bone marrow biopsy, and imaging studies. Treatment typically includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient in this case has a diffuse papular eruption, which is a characteristic finding of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The patient also has splenomegaly and axillary lymphadenopathy, which are other common findings in this condition. The peripheral blood smear shows the presence of abnormal T-cells, which is diagnostic of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that can affect the skin, but it does not typically cause a diffuse papular eruption. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a rash, but it does not typically cause a diffuse papular eruption. Indeterminate cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that can cause a skin rash, but it does not typically cause the other findings that the patient in this case has.

The patient's history of non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma, as well as his clinical presentation of a blistering erythematous eruption and painful oral lesions, are consistent with paraneoplastic pemphigus. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disorder that is associated with underlying malignancy in up to 80% of cases. The most common associated malignancies are hematologic malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but solid tumors can also be associated. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus is made based on clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and direct and indirect immunofluorescence testing. Direct immunofluorescence testing typically shows linear IgG and C3 deposition at the epidermal-dermal junction. Indirect immunofluorescence testing typically shows IgG binding to intercellular junctions of epithelial cells. The treatment of paraneoplastic pemphigus is directed at the underlying malignancy, as well as symptomatic treatment of the skin and oral lesions. Treatment of the underlying malignancy may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Symptomatic treatment of the skin and oral lesions may include topical steroids, oral steroids, and other immunosuppressive agents.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that is not associated with malignancy.
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe, life-threatening mucocutaneous reaction that is typically caused by medication or infection.
* Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that is not associated with malignancy.

A. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and underlying tissues that is caused by bacteria. It is characterized by redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. Cellulitis can be life-threatening if it is not treated promptly. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic signs of cellulitis, such as fever, chills, or lymph node enlargement. Additionally, the lesions are located in a typical area for tumid lupus erythematosus, which is the area around the arthroscopy sites.

B. Tumid lupus erythematosus is a rare form of lupus that is characterized by the formation of tender, erythematous nodules. The nodules are usually located on the extremities, but they can also occur on the trunk. Tumid lupus erythematosus is often associated with other manifestations of lupus, such as arthritis, pleuritis, and pericarditis. The patient in this case has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the lesions are located in a typical area for tumid lupus erythematosus. Additionally, the biopsy shows features that are consistent with tumid lupus erythematosus, such as perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and mucin deposition.

C. Gyrate erythema is a rare, chronic skin condition that is characterized by the formation of erythematous rings. The rings can be located anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk and extremities. Gyrate erythema is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. The patient in this case does not have any of the other features that are associated with gyrate erythema, such as a history of autoimmune disease or the presence of lesions on other parts of the body.

D. Erythema nodosum is a common inflammatory condition that is characterized by the formation of tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities. Erythema nodosum is often associated with other conditions, such as infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and sarcoidosis. The patient in this case does not have any of the other features that are associated with erythema nodosum, such as a history of infection or inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, the biopsy shows features that are consistent with tumid lupus erythematosus, such as perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and mucin deposition.

A computed tomographic scan (CT scan) is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. A CT scan of the orbit can be used to diagnose a variety of eye and orbital conditions, including tumors, inflammation, and trauma.

In the case of the man in the question, a CT scan of the orbit would be useful to determine the size, location, and extent of the mass obscuring his left eye. This information would be helpful in planning the next steps in his care.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

Exenteration is the surgical removal of an eye and its surrounding tissues. It is a radical procedure that is usually reserved for patients with advanced cancer of the eye or orbit. In the case of the man in the question, there is no evidence that he has cancer, so exenteration would not be the appropriate next step.

Enucleation is the surgical removal of an eye. It is a less radical procedure than exenteration, and it is sometimes used to treat tumors of the eye or orbit. In the case of the man in the question, enucleation may be considered if the mass obscuring his left eye is found to be malignant. However, a CT scan of the orbit is needed first to determine the size, location, and extent of the mass.

Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not the appropriate next step in the management of this patient. There is no evidence that he is at risk for HIV, and testing for HIV would not be helpful in planning his care.

 88%|████████▊ | 1343/1525 [5:29:20<36:41, 12.10s/it]The correct answer is B: Consider a diagnosis of choroidal metastasis.

The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast carcinoma with positive lymph nodes, which was diagnosed and treated 5 years prior. She developed acute painless blurred vision in her right eye 3 weeks after receiving a single injection of corticosteroid in her deltoid for stenosing tenosynovitis. Her visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed a 6 × 6-mm circumscribed serous macular detachment with turbid subretinal fluid. Similar lesions were present in the nasal and inferior midperiphery. The left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed hyperfluorescent pinpoint hot spots with interspersed hypofluorescent patches in the areas of the lesions. Notably absent on FA were retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) leakage, a smokestack pattern of subretinal leakage, or RPE gutter defects. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated choroidal thickening nasal to the optic disc; vascularity could not be assessed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a localized serous macular detachment with a focal area of choriocapillaris infiltration and thickening near the nasal edge of the detachment.

The differential diagnosis for serous macular detachment includes multifocal central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), and choroidal metastasis. Multifocal CSC is a common disorder that is typically seen in young men. It is characterized by multiple serous macular detachments that are often bilateral. VKH is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by uveitis, meningeal inflammation, and poliosis. Choroidal metastasis is a rare complication of systemic cancer. It is characterized by a solitary or multiple choroidal lesions that are often associated with retinal detachment.

The patient's history of breast cancer, the presence of multiple choroidal lesions, and the absence of other features of CSC or VKH make choroidal metastasis the most likely diagnosis. The patient should undergo further testing, such as a chest X-ray and CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, to look for a primary tumor. She should also be started on treatment for her choroidal metastasis, which may include systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation as well as the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis. Choice A, "Consider managing as multifocal central serous chorioretinopathy," is incorrect because the patient does not have the typical features of CSC, such as bilateral disease and a male predominance. Choice C, "Obtain workup for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome," is incorrect because the patient does not have the typical features of VKH, such as uveitis, meningeal inflammation, and poliosis. Choice D, "Blood tests to consider diagnosis of syphilitic chorioretinitis," is incorrect because the patient does not have the typical features of syphilitic chorioretinitis, such as a history of syphilis and a positive serologic test for syphilis.

 88%|████████▊ | 1344/1525 [5:29:37<40:39, 13.48s/it]The correct answer is D. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD).

HFMD is a common childhood illness caused by a virus. It is characterized by a fever, sore mouth, and rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The rash may start as small red spots that become blisters. The blisters usually clear up within a week or two.

HFMD is usually mild and goes away on its own. However, it can be serious in some cases, especially in young children. In rare cases, HFMD can lead to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain), or myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle).

There is no specific treatment for HFMD. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. This may include rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe antiviral medication.

HFMD is spread through contact with the virus from an infected person's saliva, mucus, or blisters. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects.

To prevent HFMD, wash your hands often with soap and water. Avoid contact with people who are sick with HFMD. If you must be around someone who is sick, wear gloves and a mask.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

A. Drug intake: Drug intake can cause a variety of side effects, including nail changes. However, the patient in this case did not report any recent changes in her medications. Additionally, the nail changes in this case are not typical of drug-induced nail changes.

B. Kawasaki syndrome: Kawasaki syndrome is a rare childhood illness that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels. It is characterized by a fever, rash, red eyes, swollen lymph nodes, and cracked lips. The patient in this case does not have any of the symptoms of Kawasaki syndrome.

 88%|████████▊ | 1345/1525 [5:29:54<43:11, 14.39s/it]The correct answer is B. Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma.

Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that arises from the sinonasal region. It is composed of a mixture of epithelial, mesenchymal, and neuroectodermal elements. The tumor is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis.

The patient in the case presented with a 7-month history of worsening, primarily left-sided, sinus obstruction and congestion with associated hyposmia, facial pressure, and headaches. He had no history of sinus disease or surgery and had no epistaxis, weight loss, or visual symptoms. Computed tomography showed a 3.1-cm mass in the left ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity. Positron emission tomographic scanning showed no evidence of metastasis. Nasal endoscopy revealed a friable, polypoid mass in the ethmoid sinus with extension into the nasal cavity and superiorly to the skull base. A biopsy specimen showed a heterogeneous tumor with small, angulated, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, apoptosis, and mitosis, malignant glands lined by cuboidal cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The glands had luminal mucin production. Focally, there were also scattered round cells with abundant eosinophilic, refractile cytoplasm, features of rhabdomyoblasts. These latter cells were strongly positive for desmin and myogenin.

The differential diagnosis for a sinonasal mass includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign neoplasms include inverting papilloma, nasal polyp, and juvenile angiofibroma. The most common malignant neoplasms include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and esthesioneuroblastoma.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic features of the tumor in the case are most consistent with sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma. The tumor is a high-grade malignancy that is often aggressive and has a poor prognosis. The treatment of sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma is typically multimodal, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It is typically a low-grade malignancy with a good prognosis. The patient in the case presented with a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis.

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare, benign, vascular tumor that occurs almost exclusively in adolescent males. It is a locally aggressive tumor that can invade adjacent structures, including the skull base, orbit, and brain. JNA is typically diagnosed with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgery, with or without radiation therapy.

Inverting papilloma is a benign, non-cancerous tumor that typically arises from the nasal mucosa. It is more common in adults than in children, and is more common in men than in women. Inverting papillomas are typically diagnosed with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgery.

Respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma (REAR) is a rare, benign tumor that typically arises from the respiratory tract. It is more common in children than in adults, and is more common in males than in females. REARs are typically diagnosed with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgery.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 50s who presented with an 8-week history of increasing headache, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and nasal congestion. Endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy revealed a large polypoid nasal mass occupying the left nasal roof and completely obstructing the nasal passage. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.7 × 3.5 × 2.6-cm soft-tissue mass within the left ethmoid cavity, eroding through the cribriform plate with adjacent dural enhancement. Intraoperative pathologic examination showed polypoid spindle cell proliferation. Histopathologic findings showed respiratory epithelium with submucosal vascular proliferation with no atypia among the lining endothelial cells. The Figure, B, shows a central vessel surrounded by lobules of endothelial lined capillaries. The Figure, C, highlights the endothelial cells of the numerous capillaries and the central vessel.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is lobular capillary hemangioma. Lobular capillary hemangioma is a benign, vascular tumor that typically arises from the skin or mucous membranes. It is more common in children than in adults, and is more common in females than in males. Lobular capillary hemangiomas are typically diagnosed with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgery.

Exuberant osteophytes are common, benign bone growths that occur at the edges of joints. They are caused by repetitive stress on the joint, such as from arthritis or overuse. Exuberant osteophytes are usually not painful and do not require treatment. However, they can sometimes cause pain, stiffness, or limited range of motion in the joint.

Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a condition that causes the growth of new bone on the outside of the spine. DISH is most common in older adults, and it is more common in men than in women. The cause of DISH is unknown, but it is thought to be related to aging and inflammation. DISH is usually not painful, but it can cause stiffness and pain in the back.

Osteochondromas are benign tumors that arise from the growth plate of a bone. They are the most common type of bone tumor, and they usually occur in children and adolescents. Osteochondromas are usually not painful, but they can sometimes cause pain, swelling, or limited range of motion in the affected area.

Osteoid osteomas are benign tumors that occur in the bone. They are most common in young adults, and they are more common in men than in women. Osteoid osteomas are usually painful, and they can cause swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected area.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 60s who presented with a 10-year history of oropharyngeal discomfort and recent episodes of snoring and obstructive sleep disturbance. Although she had been experiencing a gradually increasing lumpy feeling on swallowing for at least 6 months, she did not experience of dysphagia, dyspnea, or pain. Physical examination revealed a mass measuring approximately 4 × 3 cm and covered with normal mucosa on the posterior oropharyngeal wall. This tumor was firm, nontender, and firmly adherent. Computed tomography (CT) showed a segmented bony lesion located at the odontoid process and the body of the C2 vertebra. This mass showed high signal intensity with a hypointense rim in both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Polysomnography was performed and showed an apnea-hypopnea index of 58.7/h and a minimal oxygen saturation of 76%, which led to a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The mass was considered causative of obstructive sleep apnea. Hence, we performed total excision of the mass using a per-oral approach.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is osteochondroma. Osteochondromas are benign tumors that arise from the growth plate of a bone. They are the most common type of bone tumor, and they usually occur in children and adolescents. Osteochondromas are usually not painful, but they can sometimes cause pain, swelling, or limited range of motion in the affected area. In this case, the patient presented with a gradually increasing lumpy feeling on swallowing for at least 6 months. The mass was firm, nontender, and firmly adherent. CT showed a segmented bony lesion located at the odontoid process and the body of the C2 vertebra. This mass showed high signal intensity with a hypointense rim in both T1- and T2-weighted MRI. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of osteochondroma.

Exuberant osteophytes, DISH, and osteoid osteomas are all less likely diagnoses in this case. Exuberant osteophytes are common, benign bone growths that occur at the edges of joints. They are caused by repetitive stress on the joint, such as from arthritis or overuse. Exuberant osteophytes are usually not painful and do not require treatment. However, they can sometimes cause pain, stiffness, or limited range of motion in the joint. In this case, the patient did not have a history of joint pain or overuse. DISH is a condition that causes the growth of new bone on the outside of the spine. DISH is most common in older adults, and it is more common in men than in women. The cause of DISH is unknown, but it is thought to be related to aging and inflammation. DISH is usually not painful, but it can cause stiffness and pain in the back.

Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands, accounting for 70-80% of all salivary gland tumors. It is a slow-growing tumor that typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland. The tumor is composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, which gives it a "pleomorphic" appearance. Pleomorphic adenomas are usually well-circumscribed and can be easily removed surgically. The prognosis for patients with pleomorphic adenoma is excellent, with a recurrence rate of less than 10%.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the second most common malignant tumor of the salivary glands. It is a slow-growing tumor that typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland. The tumor is composed of a mixture of mucus-secreting cells, epidermoid cells, and intermediate cells. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma can be classified into low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade tumors. Low-grade tumors are the most common type and have a good prognosis. Intermediate-grade tumors have an intermediate prognosis, and high-grade tumors have a poor prognosis.

Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It is the most common tumor of the soft tissues in children. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. They are typically small, red, and raised lesions. Hemangiomas usually regress spontaneously over time, but they can sometimes cause problems if they are large or located in a sensitive area.

Granular cell tumor is a rare, benign tumor that can occur anywhere in the body. It is most common in the skin, but it can also occur in the muscles, nerves, and other soft tissues. Granular cell tumors are typically small, painless masses. They are usually not cancerous, but they can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

In the case of the teenage girl presented in the question, the most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic adenoma. The patient is a young girl with a painless mass in the soft palate. Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands, and it is most commonly diagnosed in young adults. The tumor is usually well-circumscribed and can be easily removed surgically. The prognosis for patients with pleomorphic adenoma is excellent, with a recurrence rate of less than 10%.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor, and it is more common in older adults. Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels, and it is more common in children. Granular cell tumor is a rare, benign tumor, and it can occur anywhere in the body.

Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare form of skin cancer that begins in the Paget cells, which are specialized epithelial cells that produce the outer layer of skin. EMPD can occur anywhere on the skin, but it is most commonly found in the anogenital region (the area around the anus and genitals).

The most common symptom of EMPD is a persistent, itchy rash. The rash can be red, scaly, and sometimes weeping. It may also have a greasy or waxy appearance. EMPD can also cause burning, stinging, and pain.

In some cases, EMPD can spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. This is called metastatic EMPD. Metastatic EMPD is a serious condition that can be life-threatening.

The exact cause of EMPD is unknown. However, it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

There is no cure for EMPD, but it can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. The goal of treatment is to control the cancer and prevent it from spreading.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. Fungal infection: Fungal infections are common causes of skin rashes, but they are not typically associated with itching, burning, or pain. In addition, fungal infections are usually not persistent and do not tend to grow in size.
* C. Bowen disease: Bowen disease is a type of precancerous skin lesion that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. It is typically characterized by a single, red, scaly patch on the skin. Bowen disease is not typically associated with itching, burning, or pain.

 89%|████████▊ | 1350/1525 [5:31:13<44:13, 15.16s/it]The correct answer is C. Polycystic liver disease.

The patient is a man in his 50s who previously underwent renal transplantation for polycystic kidney disease. He presented with worsening chronic malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, early satiety, and abdominal distention with extreme discomfort. An abdominal magnetic resonance image showed a giant multinodular mass. Laparotomy exposed a giant multinodular mass occupying most of the upper abdomen.

These findings are most consistent with polycystic liver disease. Polycystic liver disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the liver. The cysts are filled with fluid and can grow to a large size. Polycystic liver disease can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. In severe cases, it can lead to liver failure.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* De novo kidney graft tumor is a rare type of cancer that can develop in a kidney transplant. The patient in this case has a history of polycystic kidney disease, which is a genetic disorder. De novo kidney graft tumor is not a genetic disorder, so it is unlikely that this is the cause of the patient's symptoms.
* Recurrence of polycystic kidney disease is possible after a kidney transplant. However, the patient in this case has a history of polycystic liver disease, not polycystic kidney disease. It is more likely that the patient's symptoms are caused by polycystic liver disease than by recurrence of polycystic kidney disease.
* Caroli disease is a rare disorder characterized by the development of abnormal bile ducts in the liver. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of Caroli disease, such as fever, chills, and jaundice. Therefore, it is unlikely that Caroli disease is the cause of the patient's symptoms.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Polycystic liver disease. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are most consistent with this diagnosis. The other answer choices are incorrect for the reasons described above.

 89%|████████▊ | 1351/1525 [5:31:22<38:24, 13.24s/it]The correct answer is D. Echinococcal disease.

The patient's history of living in China, where Echinococcus granulosus is endemic, and her history of running in areas with dog feces on the ground and eating sheep meat are consistent with exposure to the parasite. The CT scan findings of multiple, calcified cysts in the spleen are also consistent with Echinococcal disease.

Congenital cysts are rare in adults and are typically not multiple or calcified. Splenic abscesses are typically caused by bacterial infection and are not associated with a history of exposure to Echinococcus granulosus. Cystic metastasis to the spleen is a rare complication of cancer and is not associated with a history of exposure to Echinococcus granulosus.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Echinococcal disease.

 89%|████████▊ | 1352/1525 [5:31:31<34:39, 12.02s/it]The patient has euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. This is because her serum sodium concentration is low (125 mEq/L), her serum osmolality is low (260 mOsm/kg), and her total body water is normal. She does not have signs of hypovolemia, such as dry mucous membranes, hypotension, or tachycardia. She also does not have signs of hypervolemia, such as peripheral edema or jugular venous distention. Her medications do not include any known causes of hyponatremia. The most likely cause of her hyponatremia is syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is a condition in which the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which causes the kidneys to reabsorb water from the urine. This can lead to hyponatremia. Other possible causes of hyponatremia include diuretics, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism. However, these are less likely in this patient.

The treatment of hyponatremia depends on the severity of the hyponatremia and the underlying cause. In mild cases of hyponatremia, treatment may not be necessary. In more severe cases, treatment may include fluid restriction, diuretics, or hypertonic saline. The goal of treatment is to raise the serum sodium concentration gradually to avoid complications, such as seizures and brain damage.

The following are the explanations why the other choices are incorrect:

* A. The patient does not have hypovolemic hyponatremia. This is because her serum sodium concentration is low (125 mEq/L), but her serum osmolality is low (260 mOsm/kg). In hypovolemic hyponatremia, the serum sodium concentration is low and the serum osmolality is high. This is because the body has lost more water than sodium.
* C. The patient does not have hypervolemic hypertonic hyponatremia. This is because her serum sodium concentration is low (125 mEq/L), but her serum osmolality is low (260 mOsm/kg). In hypervolemic hypertonic hyponatremia, the serum sodium concentration is low and the serum osmolality is high. This is because the body has gained more sodium than water.
* D. The patient does not have hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. This is because her serum sodium concentration is low (125 mEq/L), but her serum osmolality is low (260 mOsm/kg). In hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia, the serum sodium concentration is low and the serum osmolality is low. This is because the body has gained more water than sodium.

 89%|████████▊ | 1353/1525 [5:31:45<36:09, 12.61s/it]The correct answer is C: Perform skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence.

The patient in the case report has a history of dermatitis herpetiformis, a chronic autoimmune blistering skin disease associated with gluten sensitivity. The most common initial presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis is a pruritic rash on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. The rash is characterized by grouped papules, vesicles, and erosions. Direct immunofluorescence of a skin biopsy from a lesional site is the gold standard for diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. It shows granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not provide the most definitive diagnosis or treatment for dermatitis herpetiformis.

A: Examine for infestation with scabies. Scabies is a parasitic skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The most common initial presentation of scabies is a pruritic rash on the hands, wrists, forearms, axillae, groin, and buttocks. The rash is characterized by papules, vesicles, and burrows. A skin scraping from an affected area can be examined microscopically to identify the mite or its eggs. Treatment for scabies is topical permethrin or oral ivermectin.

B: Obtain complete blood cell count and creatinine level. A complete blood cell count (CBC) and creatinine level are not specific for dermatitis herpetiformis. A CBC may show a mild leukocytosis, and a creatinine level may be elevated in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. However, these tests are not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis.

D: Obtain a chest radiograph. A chest radiograph is not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis. However, it may be ordered to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as pneumonia or heart failure.

 89%|████████▉ | 1354/1525 [5:31:57<35:02, 12.30s/it]The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function. This is the correct answer because the patient has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, which are risk factors for aortic valve stenosis. The patient also has a late-peaking systolic murmur that radiated to the carotids, which is a classic finding of aortic valve stenosis. The TTE showed that the patient has a thickened and calcified aortic valve with a mean transaortic pressure gradient of 50 mm Hg. This is consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis. The patient's left ventricular systolic function is preserved, which means that the left ventricle is still able to pump blood effectively despite the aortic valve stenosis.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice A: The patient does not have a dilated cardiomyopathy. A dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the left ventricle is enlarged and has reduced systolic function. The patient's left ventricular systolic function is preserved, so this is not the correct diagnosis.
* Choice B: The patient does not have obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the left ventricle is thickened and the aortic valve is narrowed. This can cause a systolic murmur, but the murmur is usually harsh and crescendo-decrescendo, not late-peaking. The patient's murmur is late-peaking, so this is not the correct diagnosis.
* Choice C: The patient does not have moderate aortic valve stenosis with the severity overestimated by Doppler measurements. Doppler echocardiography is a technique that uses sound waves to measure the velocity of blood flow through the heart. In aortic valve stenosis, the Doppler echocardiogram will show a high velocity of blood flow across the aortic valve. This can be used to calculate the severity of the stenosis. In the patient's case, the Doppler echocardiogram showed a mean transaortic pressure gradient of 50 mm Hg, which is consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis. Therefore, this is not the correct diagnosis.

 89%|████████▉ | 1355/1525 [5:32:12<37:16, 13.15s/it]The correct answer is "C": Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the brain and orbits.

The patient is presenting with severe bilateral optic disc edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and absent spontaneous venous pulsations. These findings are consistent with papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure. The most common cause of papilledema is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which is a blockage of one or more of the cerebral venous sinuses.

CVST is a serious condition that can lead to blindness, stroke, and death. It is important to diagnose CVST as early as possible so that treatment can be initiated. The gold standard for diagnosing CVST is magnetic resonance venography (MRV), which is a type of MRI that can visualize the cerebral venous sinuses. MRV is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scan for the diagnosis of CVST.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of a patient with papilledema. A skeletal survey is not necessary to diagnose CVST. Lumbar puncture is not necessary to diagnose CVST, and it may be dangerous in patients with CVST because it can increase the risk of bleeding. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis is not necessary to diagnose CVST.

In conclusion, the correct answer is "C": Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the brain and orbits.

 89%|████████▉ | 1356/1525 [5:32:23<35:04, 12.45s/it]The correct answer is B. Fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine.

The patient has a history of chronic use of meperidine, a medication that can cause fibrosis and ulceration of the skin. The physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis, including the large, deep, irregularly shaped, cutaneous ulcer on the dorsum of the right forearm, necrotic tissue and muscle exposure at the base of the ulcer, woody induration of skin on both forearms and on the abdominal region, bilateral contracture of deltoid, triceps, and biceps muscles, and restricted range of motion at the shoulders and elbows. The laboratory findings are also consistent with this diagnosis, including a raised serum creatinine kinase level.

The other choices are incorrect. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, inflammatory skin disease that can cause ulcerations, but it is not associated with fibrosis. Localized scleroderma (morphea) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause fibrosis of the skin, but it is not associated with ulcerations. Mycobacterium haemophilum infection is a rare, opportunistic infection that can cause skin ulcers, but it is not associated with fibrosis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is B. Fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine.

 89%|████████▉ | 1357/1525 [5:32:38<36:58, 13.20s/it]The correct answer is B. Condyloma lata.

Condyloma lata are large, flat, wart-like lesions that are caused by the sexually transmitted infection (STI) syphilis. They are typically found in the genital area, but can also occur on the buttocks, thighs, and arms. Condyloma lata are usually moist and have a grayish-white appearance. They may be painful or itchy.

The diagnosis of condyloma lata is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A blood test can be used to detect the presence of syphilis. A biopsy of the lesion can also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Condyloma lata are treated with antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotic is penicillin. Treatment is usually successful, but the lesions may recur if the infection is not treated completely.

A is incorrect because condyloma acuminata are small, cauliflower-like growths that are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically found on the genitals, but can also occur on the anus, mouth, and throat. Condyloma acuminata are usually not painful, but they can be itchy.

C is incorrect because verrucous herpes simplex virus is a type of herpes simplex virus that can cause genital warts. Genital warts are small, raised growths that are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically found on the genitals, but can also occur on the anus, mouth, and throat. Genital warts are usually not painful, but they can be itchy.

D is incorrect because granuloma inguinale is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is caused by the bacterium Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. It is characterized by painless, beefy red, granulomatous lesions on the genitals, groin, or perianal area. The lesions may become ulcerated and may bleed or discharge pus. Granuloma inguinale is treated with antibiotics.

 89%|████████▉ | 1358/1525 [5:32:51<36:43, 13.20s/it]The correct answer is B. Primary oral histoplasmosis.

The patient is a 40-year-old man who resides in the eastern part of India, which is an area where histoplasmosis is endemic. The lesion had started as a small painless mass on the right lateral aspect of the tongue, which gradually grew and subsequently ulcerated. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of primary oral histoplasmosis, which typically presents as a single, non-healing ulcer on the tongue. The lesion was asymptomatic except for causing mild difficulty in eating, which is also consistent with primary oral histoplasmosis. The patient could not recall any history of trauma or tongue bite preceding the lesion, which makes squamous cell carcinoma less likely. He denied consuming tobacco or alcohol regularly, which also makes squamous cell carcinoma less likely. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 2 years, which was well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. This does not increase the risk of primary oral histoplasmosis. There was no systemic complaints, which makes tubercular chancre less likely. There was no history of high-risk behavior for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, which makes mucosal leishmaniasis less likely. On physical examination, there was a single well-defined ulcer measuring 2 × 2 cm on the right lateral aspect of tongue with a clean base and irregular and elevated heaped-up margins. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of primary oral histoplasmosis. There was no underlying induration, friability, or bleeding on manipulation, which makes squamous cell carcinoma less likely. A 3-mm punch biopsy from the edge of the ulcer was taken and sent for histopathological examination. The biopsy showed a mixed cell infiltrate with intracellular yeast forms within the histiocytes, which is diagnostic of primary oral histoplasmosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Primary oral histoplasmosis.

 89%|████████▉ | 1359/1525 [5:33:07<39:15, 14.19s/it]The correct answer is D. Cut-and-push-through technique.

The back-out technique is not recommended because it is difficult to remove the hook without further damaging the eye. The advance-and-cut technique is also not recommended because it can cause the hook to break off in the eye. The needle-cover technique is not recommended because it can damage the eye.

The cut-and-push-through technique is the safest and most effective way to remove a fishhook from the eye. The technique involves cutting the lure, making a corneal exit wound next to the distal end of the hook, and rotating the hook through the exit wound. This technique minimizes the risk of further damage to the eye.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each technique:

**Back-out technique:** This technique involves removing the hook in a retrograde manner through its entry wound. The hook is grasped with forceps and then rotated in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction until it is free of the tissue. This technique is difficult to perform and can cause further damage to the eye.

**Advance-and-cut technique:** This technique involves rotating the hook anterogradely, clipping the barb, and back out the hook retrogradely through the entry wound. The hook is grasped with forceps and then rotated in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction until it is free of the tissue. The barb is then clipped with wire cutters and the hook is removed. This technique can cause the hook to break off in the eye.

**Needle-cover technique:** This technique involves using the bevel of a large bore needle through the entry wound to engage and “cover” the barb, then withdraw together. The needle is inserted through the entry wound and then rotated until it engages the barb. The needle is then withdrawn together with the hook. This technique can damage the eye.

**Cut-and-push-through technique:** This technique involves cutting the lure, making a corneal exit wound next to the distal end of the hook, and rotating the hook through the exit wound. The hook is grasped with forceps and then cut with wire cutters. A corneal exit wound is then made next to the distal end of the hook. The hook is then rotated through the exit wound and removed. This technique is the safest and most effective way to remove a fishhook from the eye.

 89%|████████▉ | 1360/1525 [5:33:17<35:07, 12.77s/it]The correct answer is C. Intravenous vitamin therapy.

The patient has a history of gastric bypass surgery, which is a type of bariatric surgery that involves creating a small stomach pouch and bypassing part of the small intestine. This type of surgery can lead to vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for the proper function of the nervous system, and deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision problems, confusion, and ataxia.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, and the findings on her physical examination are also consistent with this diagnosis. The dilated fundus examination revealed disc edema in both eyes with peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickening and large intraretinal hemorrhages. These findings are consistent with optic neuropathy, which can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency.

The next step in management is to treat the vitamin B12 deficiency with intravenous vitamin therapy. This will help to improve the patient's symptoms and prevent further damage to the nervous system.

Lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging and/or venography may be helpful in ruling out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brain tumor or stroke, but they are not necessary to diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency. Intravenous corticosteroids are not indicated in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of inflammation.

 89%|████████▉ | 1361/1525 [5:33:29<34:35, 12.66s/it]The correct answer is C. Esophageal perforation.

The patient is a 5-week-old neonate who developed difficulty breathing and apnea requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He was transported to a local emergency department and intubated. He was then transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit with a presumptive diagnosis of bronchiolitis. During the next 2 days, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation and received oxygen via the nasal cannula. He began feeding orally and was transferred to the general inpatient floor. At the time of transfer, the patient was noted to have choking with feeds as well as a large volume of clear oral secretions that required frequent suctioning. Based on these clinical findings, oral food and fluids were withheld from the patient and a fluoroscopic video swallowing study (FVSS) was performed.

The FVSS showed a small perforation in the esophagus at the level of the aortic arch. This perforation was likely caused by the difficult orotracheal intubation with multiple attempts. The perforation allowed gastric contents to leak into the mediastinum, causing inflammation and infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics and surgery to repair the perforation. He made a full recovery.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which stomach contents back up into the esophagus. It is not a cause of difficulty breathing or apnea.
* Tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. It is not a cause of difficulty breathing or apnea in an older infant.
* Aspiration is the inhalation of food, liquid, or vomit into the lungs. It can cause pneumonia, but it is not a cause of difficulty breathing or apnea.

 89%|████████▉ | 1362/1525 [5:33:39<31:43, 11.68s/it]The correct answer is C. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC).

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare, chronic, inflammatory condition of the gallbladder that is characterized by the accumulation of foamy macrophages and cholesterol clefts in the gallbladder wall. It is most commonly seen in women over the age of 50, and there is a slight association with inflammatory bowel disease.

The exact cause of XGC is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by an immune reaction to an infection or foreign body in the gallbladder. The most common organisms associated with XGC are Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Chlamydia.

The most common symptoms of XGC are abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is typically located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and may be accompanied by fever, chills, and jaundice.

The diagnosis of XGC is made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). XGC can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions that cause inflammation of the gallbladder, such as acute cholecystitis, carcinoma of the gallbladder, and lymphoma.

Treatment for XGC typically involves surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). In some cases, antibiotics may also be necessary to treat the underlying infection.

The prognosis for patients with XGC is generally good. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients make a full recovery. However, XGC can be a life-threatening condition if it is not treated promptly.

Acute cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder that is caused by a blockage of the cystic duct. The most common cause of a blocked cystic duct is a gallstone. Symptoms of acute cholecystitis include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and jaundice. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as ultrasonography and CT scan. Treatment is usually with antibiotics and surgery to remove the gallbladder.

Carcinoma of the gallbladder is a rare cancer that starts in the gallbladder. Symptoms of carcinoma of the gallbladder include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI. Treatment is usually with surgery to remove the gallbladder and chemotherapy.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymph nodes. Symptoms of lymphoma can vary depending on the type of lymphoma and the stage of the disease. Common symptoms include fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and swollen lymph nodes. Diagnosis is made with blood tests, imaging studies, and a biopsy. Treatment for lymphoma depends on the type of lymphoma and the stage of the disease. Common treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with XGC. The patient is a woman over the age of 50 with a history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has also lost weight and has been depressed. On examination, she has a positive Murphy sign. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and her C-reaction protein level is elevated. Imaging studies show a thickened gallbladder wall with a hypoattenuated intramural nodule. These findings are all consistent with XGC.

Acute cholecystitis is less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of gallstones. Carcinoma of the gallbladder is less likely because the patient is not jaundiced and does not have a mass on imaging studies. Lymphoma is less likely because the patient does not have lymphadenopathy or other symptoms of lymphoma.

 89%|████████▉ | 1363/1525 [5:33:55<35:22, 13.10s/it]The correct answer is D. Ovarian cyst with torsion.

Cecal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when there is an abnormal duplication of the cecum. It is usually diagnosed in childhood and can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, it is unlikely to cause abdominal distention and labial swelling.

Small-bowel volvulus is a twisting of the small intestine that can cause obstruction and ischemia. It is a life-threatening condition that requires emergency surgery. However, it is unlikely to cause unilateral labial swelling.

Infantile leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of the smooth muscle of the intestines. It is usually diagnosed in infants and young children and can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, it is unlikely to cause unilateral labial swelling.

Ovarian cyst with torsion is a condition that occurs when an ovarian cyst twists on its stalk, cutting off the blood supply to the ovary. It is a common cause of acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age. It can cause abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and labial swelling.

In this case, the patient is a 2-day-old girl with abdominal distention, vomiting, and right-sided labial swelling. The abdominal radiograph shows dilated small-bowel loops. Radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract with water-soluble contrast shows a normal pattern of rotation. Results of a suction rectal biopsy reveal ganglion cells to be present. Serial abdominal radiographic images showed retained contrast in the terminal ileum 6 days following the gastrointestinal series.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is ovarian cyst with torsion. The abdominal distention and vomiting are consistent with bowel obstruction, which is a common complication of ovarian cyst with torsion. The right-sided labial swelling is also consistent with ovarian cyst with torsion, as ovarian cysts can often cause swelling of the labia. The abdominal radiograph shows dilated small-bowel loops, which is consistent with bowel obstruction. The radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract with water-soluble contrast shows a normal pattern of rotation, which rules out small-bowel volvulus. The results of the suction rectal biopsy reveal ganglion cells to be present, which is consistent with a diagnosis of ovarian cyst. The serial abdominal radiographic images showed retained contrast in the terminal ileum 6 days following the gastrointestinal series, which is also consistent with ovarian cyst with torsion.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is ovarian cyst with torsion.

 89%|████████▉ | 1364/1525 [5:34:08<35:21, 13.18s/it]The correct answer is B. The patient has lactic acidosis from lymphoma.

Lactic acidosis is a condition in which the blood has too much lactic acid. Lactic acid is a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down glucose for energy. Normally, the body can get rid of lactic acid through the kidneys. However, if the body produces too much lactic acid or if the kidneys cannot get rid of it properly, the blood level of lactic acid can increase.

There are many causes of lactic acidosis, including:

* Heart failure
* Liver disease
* Kidney disease
* Sepsis
* Severe infection
* Malnutrition
* Certain medications
* Cancer

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely cause of the elevated lactate level is the lymphoma. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are part of the immune system and they help to fight infection. Lymphoma can cause the lymph nodes to swell and it can also spread to other parts of the body, including the abdomen.

When lymphoma spreads to the abdomen, it can cause a number of problems, including:

* Intestinal obstruction
* Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen)
* Malnutrition
* Sepsis
* Lactic acidosis

In the case of the patient in the question, the elevated lactate level is likely due to the lymphoma itself. The lymphoma is causing the body to produce too much lactic acid and the kidneys are not able to get rid of it properly. This is causing the patient to have lactic acidosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Hypovolemic shock is a condition in which the body loses too much blood or fluid. This can cause a number of problems, including low blood pressure, shock, and organ failure. However, hypovolemic shock is not the most likely cause of the elevated lactate level in the patient in the question.

Mesenteric ischemia is a condition in which the blood supply to the intestines is blocked. This can cause a number of problems, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. However, mesenteric ischemia is not the most likely cause of the elevated lactate level in the patient in the question.

Sepsis is a condition in which the body's immune system responds to an infection in a way that damages the body's own tissues and organs. This can cause a number of problems, including high fever, low blood pressure, and organ failure. However, sepsis is not the most likely cause of the elevated lactate level in the patient in the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. The patient has lactic acidosis from lymphoma.

A. Start intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and obtain serum lactate level and blood and sputum cultures is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs of infection. The chest radiograph and computed tomography scan of the chest are normal, and the patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits. There is no evidence of pneumonia or other infection.

B. Start oxygen, β2-agonist nebulizer treatments, steroids, and oral azithromycin is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% with supplemental oxygen, and there are no wheezes or crackles on lung auscultation.

C. Start aspirin, β-blocker, and consider cardiac catheterization is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs of heart disease. The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm without acute ST or T-wave changes. There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

D. Observe and provide supplemental oxygen is the correct answer because the patient is currently stable and does not require any further treatment. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% with supplemental oxygen, and there are no signs of infection or heart disease. The patient should be observed closely for any signs of deterioration.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that is often seen in people with HIV infection. The patient's skin lesions are characteristic of Kaposi's sarcoma, and his weight loss is a common symptom of the disease. The patient's lack of history of malignancy or exposure to communicable diseases makes it less likely that he has another cause of his skin lesions, such as cancer or an infection.

An HIV test is the most important diagnostic test for Kaposi's sarcoma. If the patient is HIV-positive, he will need to be treated with antiretroviral therapy to prevent the progression of his disease. If the patient is not HIV-positive, he will need to be evaluated for other possible causes of his skin lesions.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's skin lesions. A topical steroid would not be effective in treating Kaposi's sarcoma, and photodynamic therapy is a treatment for skin cancer that is not typically used for Kaposi's sarcoma. Computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would not be helpful in diagnosing Kaposi's sarcoma.

Gilbert syndrome is a common, benign, inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism characterized by mild, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia. It is caused by a defect in the uptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes. The diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes of hyperbilirubinemia, such as hemolysis, liver disease, and cholestasis.

The patient in the case presented has several features that are consistent with Gilbert syndrome. He is a middle-aged man with a history of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia. He has no family history of liver disease, and he does not take any medications. His physical examination is unremarkable, and his laboratory values show a mild elevation in unconjugated bilirubin.

A diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome can be confirmed by measuring the activity of the enzyme glucuronyl transferase, which is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin. In patients with Gilbert syndrome, the activity of glucuronyl transferase is reduced.

Gilbert syndrome is a self-limiting condition that does not require treatment. Patients with Gilbert syndrome should avoid alcohol and other hepatotoxic drugs. They should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of liver disease, such as jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cholelithiasis is a condition in which gallstones form in the gallbladder. It is a common cause of biliary colic, which is a severe pain in the right upper abdomen. The patient in the case presented does not have any symptoms of cholelithiasis, and his laboratory values do not show any evidence of gallstones.
* Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism characterized by chronic, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is caused by a defect in the excretion of bilirubin into the bile. The patient in the case presented does not have any symptoms of Dubin-Johnson syndrome, and his laboratory values do not show any evidence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
* Hemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells. It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as infection, autoimmune disease, and medication side effects. Hemolysis can lead to a rise in both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The patient in the case presented does not have any symptoms of hemolysis, and his laboratory values do not show any evidence of hemolysis.

Syringomatous adenoma of the nipple is a rare benign neoplasm of the breast. It is a slow-growing tumor that typically presents as a painless subareolar nodule. The tumor is composed of small, branching ducts lined by cuboidal or columnar epithelium. The ducts may be cystically dilated. Syringomatous adenoma of the nipple is usually diagnosed on biopsy. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

Tubular carcinoma is a type of invasive breast cancer. It is a relatively rare type of cancer, accounting for about 2% of all breast cancers. Tubular carcinoma is typically a slow-growing cancer with a good prognosis. The tumor is composed of small, tubular glands. Tubular carcinoma is usually diagnosed on biopsy. Treatment is typically surgery, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.

Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma is a type of invasive breast cancer. It is a rare type of cancer, accounting for about 1% of all breast cancers. Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma is typically a slow-growing cancer with a good prognosis. The tumor is composed of both glandular and squamous cells. Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma is usually diagnosed on biopsy. Treatment is typically surgery, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.

Florid papillomatosis of the nipple is a benign condition of the breast. It is characterized by the presence of multiple papillomas, which are small, finger-like projections of tissue. Florid papillomatosis of the nipple is usually not associated with any symptoms. However, it can sometimes cause nipple discharge or bleeding. Florid papillomatosis of the nipple is usually diagnosed on biopsy. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy 60-year-old woman with a painless subareolar nodule of her left nipple measuring 2 cm in diameter. The nodule has been present for several months. Screening mammography performed 4 weeks prior revealed a large grouping of left breast subareolar calcifications extending into the skin and nipple. Follow-up ultrasonography demonstrated no discrete abnormal mass or shadowing but did show multiple echogenic foci consistent with findings on mammography. An incisional biopsy specimen of the mass was obtained and sent for histopathologic evaluation. The biopsy specimen showed a well-circumscribed nodule of epithelial cells arranged in small, branching ducts. The ducts were lined by cuboidal or columnar epithelium. The ducts were not cystically dilated. The findings were consistent with a diagnosis of syringomatous adenoma of the nipple.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are all types of breast cancer. Tubular carcinoma, low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, and florid papillomatosis of the nipple are all benign conditions of the breast. However, syringomatous adenoma of the nipple is a rare type of breast cancer.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the breast is a rare type of leukemia that affects the white blood cells. It is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and bruising. The diagnosis is made with a blood test and a bone marrow biopsy. The treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Breast implant foreign body reaction is a condition that occurs when the body rejects a breast implant. The symptoms of breast implant foreign body reaction include pain, swelling, and redness around the implant. The diagnosis is made with a physical exam and imaging tests, such as an MRI or mammogram. The treatment for breast implant foreign body reaction is to remove the implant.

Severe postpartum mastitis is a condition that occurs when a woman develops an infection of the breast tissue after giving birth. The symptoms of severe postpartum mastitis include fever, chills, pain, and redness in the breast. The diagnosis is made with a physical exam and blood tests. The treatment for severe postpartum mastitis is antibiotics.

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of Burkitt lymphoma include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and swelling of the lymph nodes. The diagnosis is made with a biopsy of the lymph node. The treatment for Burkitt lymphoma includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

In the case presented, the woman is a healthy woman in her 40s, lactating, 5 months post partum, who presented with a 1-month history of enlargement and induration of both breasts. She was initially diagnosed with mastitis and received several courses of antibiotics for 2 months without improvement. Subsequently she presented with back pain, paresthesias, shooting pain in the mandibular region, and diplopia. All of these conditions improved under treatment with oral corticosteroids, but the breast enlargement continued. Laboratory test results highlighted a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL and a platelet count of 80 000/μL.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is Burkitt lymphoma of the breast. The patient's age, history of lactation, and presentation with enlargement and induration of both breasts are all consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. The patient's response to oral corticosteroids is also consistent with Burkitt lymphoma, as this type of lymphoma is often sensitive to steroids. The laboratory test results, which show a low hemoglobin level and a low platelet count, are also consistent with Burkitt lymphoma.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the breast is a rare type of leukemia that affects the white blood cells. It is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and bruising. The diagnosis is made with a blood test and a bone marrow biopsy. The treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, the patient in this case is an adult, and she does not have any of the classic symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Breast implant foreign body reaction is a condition that occurs when the body rejects a breast implant. The symptoms of breast implant foreign body reaction include pain, swelling, and redness around the implant. The diagnosis is made with a physical exam and imaging tests, such as an MRI or mammogram.

 90%|████████▉ | 1371/1525 [5:35:52<37:35, 14.64s/it]The correct answer is B: brain imaging and echocardiography.

The patient has a history of linear epidermal nevus syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of linear epidermal nevi (LENs) and other abnormalities, including hamartomas of the brain, eye, and heart. The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with this diagnosis, as he has a LEN and a retinal astrocytic hamartoma.

The next step in the management of this patient is to evaluate for the presence of other associated abnormalities, particularly those involving the brain and heart. Brain imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is the most sensitive test for the detection of hamartomas of the brain. Echocardiography is the most sensitive test for the detection of cardiac hamartomas.

Renal ultrasonography and lumbar puncture are not necessary in this patient, as there is no evidence of renal or central nervous system involvement. Metastatic workup is also not necessary, as there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the ocular lesion is not necessary, as the diagnosis of retinal astrocytic hamartoma is based on clinical presentation and imaging findings.

 90%|████████▉ | 1372/1525 [5:36:01<32:58, 12.93s/it]The correct answer is B. Check antinuclear antibody (ANA) level.

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and arthritis, which are both risk factors for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes. One of the most common eye manifestations of SLE is retinal vasculitis, which can cause subconjunctival hemorrhages and retinal vascular abnormalities.

ANA is an antibody that can be found in the blood of people with SLE. Testing for ANA is a sensitive and specific way to screen for SLE. If the ANA test is positive, the patient will need to undergo further testing to confirm the diagnosis of SLE.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not specific to SLE. Checking blood pressure is important for all adults, but it is not a specific test for SLE. Checking hemoglobin A1c level is important for people with diabetes, but it is not a specific test for SLE. Checking erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a test of inflammation, but it is not a specific test for SLE.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Check antinuclear antibody (ANA) level. This is because ANA is a specific test for SLE, which is the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case.

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and no other medical history who had worsening left-sided back pain over 4 months. The physical examination findings were significant for mild left flank pain, but there was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory results were within normal limits. Axial imaging demonstrated an exophytic, retroperitoneal mass with solid and cystic components involving the left kidney, posterior abdominal wall, and mesocolon. The mass measured 20 cm in its greatest dimension. Findings on colonoscopy and mammography were negative. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography did not reveal any other abnormality.

The most likely diagnosis is malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst. Enterogenous cysts are congenital lesions that arise from the embryonic gut. They are most commonly found in the abdomen, but can also occur in the chest and pelvis. Most enterogenous cysts are benign, but they can rarely undergo malignant transformation.

The patient in this case has a retroperitoneal mass with solid and cystic components. This is a classic presentation of malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst. The mass is also large, measuring 20 cm in its greatest dimension. This is also a risk factor for malignancy.

The other answer choices are less likely in this case. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is not typically found in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal sarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the soft tissues of the abdomen. It is also not typically found in the retroperitoneum. Primary neoplasm arising from the kidney is a type of cancer that originates in the kidney. It is not typically found in the retroperitoneum.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, and lack of other findings.

 90%|█████████ | 1375/1525 [5:36:32<28:59, 11.60s/it]The correct answer is B: Stent perforation.

The patient has a history of colon cancer, and the computed tomography scan shows a 9-cm, obstructed sigmoid colon mass with fistulous extensions to the bladder and small bowel. This suggests that the cancer has spread to the bladder and small bowel, and that the obstruction is causing the patient's abdominal pain and obstipation.

The stent placement was done to relieve the obstruction and allow the patient to pass stool. However, the stent perforation is a complication of the procedure. The stent is a tube that is inserted into the colon to keep it open. If the stent is not placed correctly, it can perforate the colon, which can lead to peritonitis.

The patient developed generalized peritonitis, which is an inflammation of the lining of the abdomen. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. The patient went to the operating room for an emergency laparotomy, which is a surgery to open the abdomen and remove the source of the infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

A: Colon cancer perforation is incorrect because the patient's colon cancer is not obstructing the colon.

C: Acute mesenteric ischemia is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of ischemia, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

D: Perforated diverticulitis is incorrect because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of diverticulitis, such as fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness.

 90%|█████████ | 1376/1525 [5:36:44<29:11, 11.76s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform a skin scraping with microscopy.

Crusted scabies is a highly contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mites burrow into the skin and lay eggs, which cause an intense itching rash. The rash is often worse at night and can be accompanied by secondary bacterial infections.

Crusted scabies is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. In people with HIV/AIDS, crusted scabies can be very severe and difficult to treat.

The diagnosis of crusted scabies is made by examining a skin scraping under a microscope. The scraping will show the mites or their eggs.

The treatment for crusted scabies is a single dose of oral ivermectin. In addition, all household members and sexual partners should be treated, even if they do not have any symptoms.

Topical corticosteroids are not effective in treating crusted scabies. Topical antifungals are not effective because crusted scabies is not caused by a fungus. Syphilis serology is not necessary to diagnose crusted scabies.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* **A. Prescribe a topical corticosteroid.** Topical corticosteroids are not effective in treating crusted scabies. They may help to reduce the itching, but they will not kill the mites or their eggs.
* **B. Order syphilis serology.** Syphilis serology is not necessary to diagnose crusted scabies. The rash of crusted scabies is very different from the rash of syphilis.
* **C. Prescribe a topical antifungal.** Topical antifungals are not effective in treating crusted scabies. They may help to reduce the itching, but they will not kill the mites or their eggs.
* **D. Perform a skin scraping with microscopy.** This is the correct answer. A skin scraping with microscopy is the only way to definitively diagnose crusted scabies.

 90%|█████████ | 1377/1525 [5:36:54<28:07, 11.40s/it]The correct answer is B. The patient likely has sepsis, possibly with an uncontrolled infectious source, that requires further workup.

The patient's presentation is consistent with sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. He also has peripheral cyanosis, which is a sign of poor tissue perfusion. The patient's lactate level is elevated, which is a marker of tissue hypoxia.

The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cirrhosis are all risk factors for sepsis. The patient's community-acquired pneumonia is a likely source of infection.

The patient's initial treatment with fluids and antibiotics was effective in decreasing his lactate level. However, his blood pressure declined progressively through the night despite further fluid resuscitation and the addition of vasopressors. This suggests that the patient's sepsis is uncontrolled and that he may have an uncontrolled infectious source.

Further workup is needed to identify the source of infection and to determine the severity of the patient's sepsis. This workup may include blood cultures, imaging studies, and other laboratory tests. The patient may also need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. The patient's hyperlactatemia is not likely due to epinephrine-induced β2-adrenergic stimulation. Epinephrine is a catecholamine that can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. However, it does not cause hyperlactatemia.

C. The patient's lactate clearance is not likely decreased due to liver dysfunction. Liver dysfunction can impair the clearance of lactate from the blood. However, the patient's liver function tests are normal, which suggests that his liver dysfunction is not severe enough to impair lactate clearance.

D. The patient's hypoperfusion is not likely due to a lack of fluid and pressor resuscitation. The patient's blood pressure was initially controlled with fluids and antibiotics. However, his blood pressure declined progressively through the night despite further fluid resuscitation and the addition of vasopressors. This suggests that the patient's hypoperfusion is due to an underlying condition, such as sepsis.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with xanthomas, which are fatty deposits that can occur in the skin as a result of high cholesterol levels. A lipid panel is a blood test that measures the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and other fats in the blood. This test is important to order in order to assess the patient's risk for cardiovascular disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not necessary or appropriate in this case. A chest radiograph is not necessary to evaluate the patient's rash. Treating the patient empirically with oral prednisone is not appropriate without first determining the cause of the rash. Unroofing one of the papules and sending for a viral culture is not necessary or appropriate, as the patient's rash is not consistent with a viral infection.

Here are some additional details about each of the answer choices:

* A lipid panel is a blood test that measures the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and other fats in the blood. This test is important to order in order to assess the patient's risk for cardiovascular disease. High cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States.
* A chest radiograph is an X-ray of the chest. This test is used to evaluate the lungs, heart, and other structures in the chest. A chest radiograph is not necessary to evaluate the patient's rash. The patient's rash is not consistent with any pulmonary or cardiac conditions that would require a chest radiograph.
* Treating the patient empirically with oral prednisone is not appropriate without first determining the cause of the rash. Prednisone is a powerful corticosteroid medication that can have serious side effects. It is important to only use prednisone when it is absolutely necessary. In this case, the patient's rash is not severe enough to warrant treatment with prednisone.
* Unroofing one of the papules and sending for a viral culture is not necessary or appropriate, as the patient's rash is not consistent with a viral infection. Viral infections can cause a variety of skin rashes, including chickenpox, shingles, and molluscum contagiosum. However, the patient's rash is not consistent with any of these viral infections.

 90%|█████████ | 1379/1525 [5:37:24<31:40, 13.02s/it]The correct answer is C. The audiogram reveals a right-sided SNHL and impaired speech discrimination, which necessitate further investigation.

The audiogram shows a right-sided sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This is because the air conduction thresholds are higher than the bone conduction thresholds in the right ear. This indicates that the hearing loss is in the inner ear, not in the middle ear.

The audiogram also shows impaired speech discrimination in the right ear. This is because the speech discrimination score is lower than 90% in the right ear. This indicates that the patient is having difficulty understanding speech, even when the speech is presented at a comfortable level.

The presence of both a right-sided SNHL and impaired speech discrimination necessitates further investigation. This is because these findings could be due to a number of different conditions, including Meniere disease, otosclerosis, acoustic neuroma, and head trauma. Further testing, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and temporal bones, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the hearing loss.

A. This audiogram depicts sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) consistent with early Meniere disease.

This is incorrect because the audiogram does not show the characteristic findings of Meniere disease, which include fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and aural fullness.

B. This audiogram depicts age-related hearing loss (presbycusis).

This is incorrect because the audiogram does not show the characteristic findings of presbycusis, which include a high-frequency hearing loss.

D. This audiogram depicts a right-sided conductive hearing loss (CHL) with a notch at 2000 Hz, consistent with otosclerosis.

This is incorrect because the audiogram does not show the characteristic findings of otosclerosis, which include a conductive hearing loss with a notch at 2000 Hz.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pancreatic panniculitis, which is a rare inflammatory condition of the subcutaneous fat that is associated with pancreatic disease. The most common cause of pancreatic panniculitis is pancreatic cancer, but it can also be caused by other conditions such as pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, and pancreatic metastasis.

The patient in the case presented with an 8-day history of abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, subjective fever, weight loss, and fatigue. These symptoms are consistent with pancreatic disease. The patient also complained of multiple tender red lesions on his bilateral ankles and legs that appeared 2 days prior to admission. These lesions are consistent with the subcutaneous nodules that are characteristic of pancreatic panniculitis.

The physical examination revealed several ill-defined, exquisitely tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the patient's bilateral shins, medial feet, ankles, and right lower thigh without overlying ulceration, necrosis, or drainage. These findings are consistent with the clinical presentation of pancreatic panniculitis.

A punch biopsy was performed, which demonstrated pathognomonic histopathologic findings for pancreatic panniculitis. These findings included a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, fat necrosis, and a foreign body giant cell reaction.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings, the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis is most likely. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on physical examination and biopsy.

A. Erythema nodosum is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that is characterized by the appearance of tender red nodules on the lower extremities. It is most often associated with underlying infections, such as streptococcal pharyngitis or tuberculosis, but it can also be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as sarcoidosis or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient in the case presented does not have any of the risk factors for erythema nodosum, and his symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Infectious panniculitis is a rare inflammatory condition of the subcutaneous fat that is caused by infection with a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The most common cause of infectious panniculitis is infection with Staphylococcus aureus, but it can also be caused by infection with other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient in the case presented does not have any risk factors for infectious panniculitis, and his symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a deficiency of the protein α1-antitrypsin. This protein is important for protecting the lungs from damage caused by inflammation. Patients with α1-Antitrypsin deficiency are at increased risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver disease, and panniculitis. The patient in the case presented does not have any risk factors for α1-Antitrypsin deficiency, and his symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Warfarin necrosis is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. It occurs when there is a sudden decrease in the INR, which can lead to microvascular thrombosis and necrosis of the skin. The patient in this case does not have a history of warfarin use, so warfarin necrosis is not a likely diagnosis.

Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by calcification of small blood vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and diabetes mellitus. The patient in this case does not have any of these risk factors, so calciphylaxis is not a likely diagnosis.

Intravascular B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that affects the blood vessels. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including purpura, fever, and weight loss. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, so intravascular B-cell lymphoma is not a likely diagnosis.

Cutaneous cholesterol embolism is a condition that occurs when cholesterol crystals are released from atherosclerotic plaques and embolize to the skin. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including purpura, livedo reticularis, and digital necrosis. The patient in this case has a history of peripheral arterial disease and a recent history of percutaneous endovascular stenting, which are risk factors for cutaneous cholesterol embolism. The biopsy specimen shows needle-shaped clefts within the lumen of a blood vessel with minimal perivascular inflammation, which is consistent with cutaneous cholesterol embolism. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous cholesterol embolism.

Allergic contact dermatitis is a type of skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an allergen. The allergen can be a substance in a medication, a soap, or a detergent. Allergic contact dermatitis is characterized by redness, itching, and swelling of the skin. The blisters that occur with allergic contact dermatitis are usually small and clear. They may be itchy and painful. Allergic contact dermatitis is treated with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids.

Dyshidrosisiform pemphigoid is a chronic, autoimmune blistering disease that affects the palms and soles. It is characterized by the formation of small, fluid-filled blisters on the palms and soles. The blisters may be itchy or painful. Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid is treated with oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare, autoimmune blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of blisters in response to minor trauma. The blisters may be itchy or painful. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is treated with oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-week history of a bullous eruption localized to the hands and feet. He denied having pruritus or spontaneous bleeding but reported discomfort from the pressure of intact bullae. His medical history was notable for diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which was well controlled with a stable regimen of lisinopril and atenolol for several years. He denied using any new medications or supplements or making recent dose adjustments in existing medications. There was no history of a prior bullous eruption. Physical examination revealed numerous small intact bullae and large erosions on the lateral feet, soles, and toes. The extent of the bullae led to difficulty with ambulation. There were also intact vesicles on the lateral palms along with erosions demonstrating evidence of previous bullae formation. There were no vesicular or bullous lesions on the trunk, arms, legs, or mucosal surfaces. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of a biopsy specimen obtained from a bulla on the foot showed subepidermal blisters with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the papillary dermis.

The clinical presentation, history, and biopsy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of dyshidrosiform pemphigoid. Bullous tinea pedis, allergic contact dermatitis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita are all possible diagnoses, but they are less likely given the patient's presentation.

 91%|█████████ | 1383/1525 [5:38:21<34:29, 14.57s/it]The correct answer is D: Refer to otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy.

The patient has a right-sided intranasal mass, which is a potential cause of his symptoms. The mass should be biopsied to determine its cause and to rule out malignancy.

Increasing topical corticosteroid frequency, injecting sub–Tenon capsule triamcinolone acetonide, and giving oral prednisone are all appropriate treatments for uveitis, but they would not be effective in treating a nasal mass. Uveitis is inflammation of the uveal tract, which is the middle layer of the eye. It can cause pain, redness, and blurred vision. Topical corticosteroids, sub–Tenon capsule triamcinolone acetonide, and oral prednisone are all effective treatments for uveitis. However, they would not be effective in treating a nasal mass.

The patient's elevated inflammatory markers suggest that he has an inflammatory condition. However, the cause of the inflammation is not clear. The nasal mass could be the cause of the inflammation, or it could be a secondary finding. The nasal mass should be biopsied to determine its cause and to rule out malignancy.

 91%|█████████ | 1384/1525 [5:38:37<35:46, 15.22s/it]The correct answer is B. Serum antibody titer.

The patient has a history of exposure to cats and has developed unilateral optic disc edema. This is a clinical presentation that is consistent with cat-scratch disease, which is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae. The diagnosis of cat-scratch disease is often made clinically, but serological testing can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. A serum antibody titer to B. henselae is the most sensitive and specific test for cat-scratch disease.

Repeated neuroimaging is not necessary in this case because the initial MRI scan was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is not necessary because there is no evidence of meningitis or other central nervous system involvement. Blood culture analysis is not necessary because B. henselae is not a blood-borne pathogen.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Serum antibody titer. This is the most sensitive and specific test for cat-scratch disease, which is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.

 91%|█████████ | 1385/1525 [5:38:50<33:44, 14.46s/it]The correct answer is C. Tinea capitis.

Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp. It is the most common fungal infection in children, and it is caused by a variety of fungi, including Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum audouinii, and Microsporum canis.

The most common presentation of tinea capitis is annular plaques on the scalp. The plaques are typically round or oval, and they may be scaly or have a raised border. They may also be associated with hair loss.

Tinea capitis is diagnosed by a skin biopsy or by a fungal culture. Treatment is with antifungal medication, such as griseofulvin or terbinafine.

Granuloma annulare is a skin condition that causes small, round, raised lesions on the skin. It is not contagious, and it is not caused by a fungus. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare autoimmune disease that occurs in babies born to mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can cause a variety of skin problems, including annular plaques on the scalp. However, the lesions of neonatal lupus erythematosus are typically larger and more widespread than the lesions of tinea capitis.

Annular urticaria is a type of hives that causes annular lesions on the skin. It is not contagious, and it is not caused by a fungus. The cause of annular urticaria is unknown, but it is thought to be an allergic reaction.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Tinea capitis. The other choices are incorrect because they are not caused by a fungus.

 91%|█████████ | 1386/1525 [5:39:05<33:44, 14.56s/it]The correct answer is B. Free-floating arterial thrombus.

A trapped air embolus is a rare condition that occurs when air bubbles enter the bloodstream and become trapped in the heart or lungs. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. In severe cases, it can lead to death.

A ruptured arterial plaque is a condition that occurs when a plaque of fatty material on the wall of an artery ruptures. This can cause a blood clot to form, which can block the artery and lead to a stroke.

A radiographic artifact is an image that is created by the way that the X-ray beam interacts with the patient's body. It is not a real object, and it does not represent any underlying medical condition.

In the case of the patient in the question, the CT angiography shows a filling defect in the left internal carotid artery. This is consistent with a free-floating arterial thrombus. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the findings on the CT angiography.

A trapped air embolus would not cause a filling defect in the artery. A ruptured arterial plaque would cause a blood clot to form, which would also not cause a filling defect. A radiographic artifact would not be consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Free-floating arterial thrombus.

 91%|█████████ | 1387/1525 [5:39:20<33:45, 14.68s/it]The correct answer is D. The patient has primary hyperparathyroidism.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in adults. It is caused by a parathyroid adenoma, which is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. The parathyroid glands are four small glands in the neck that produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood. In primary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH, which causes the blood calcium level to rise.

The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. She is a woman of middle age, which is the typical age for the condition to develop. She has no history of low trauma fractures or nephrolithiasis, which are complications that are more common in other causes of hypercalcemia. Her laboratory values show an elevated serum calcium level and an elevated PTH level.

The other answer choices are incorrect.

* Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare genetic disorder that causes the kidneys to excrete less calcium. This can lead to hypercalcemia. However, the patient in this case does not have a family history of hypercalcemia.
* Hypercalcemia from thyroid suppression therapy is a rare side effect of levothyroxine therapy. However, the patient in this case has been taking levothyroxine for 15 years without any problems.
* Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common complication of cancer. However, the patient in this case has no history of cancer.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has primary hyperparathyroidism. This is the most likely diagnosis based on her age, sex, history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

 91%|█████████ | 1388/1525 [5:39:35<33:47, 14.80s/it]The correct answer is A: Perform skin biopsy for histopathology and culture.

The patient's history of injection drug use, opioid drug snorting, and tobacco abuse puts him at risk for developing blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that is most commonly acquired by inhalation of spores from the soil. The infection can spread to the skin, bones, and other organs.

The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with blastomycosis. The erythematous and deformed nose with small pustules and a perforated nasal septum are classic findings of blastomycosis of the nose. The white blood cell count of 19,000 cells/µL is also consistent with blastomycosis.

The computed tomography scan of the head, facial sinuses, and chest shows soft tissue swelling of the nose and several large cavitary lesions in the lungs (all lobes), with multiple bilateral nodular opacities. These findings are also consistent with blastomycosis.

The most definitive way to diagnose blastomycosis is to perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and culture. The biopsy will show the presence of Blastomyces dermatitidis, the fungus that causes blastomycosis. The culture will grow the fungus and allow for identification of the specific strain of Blastomyces dermatitidis.

Treatment for blastomycosis is with antifungal medications, such as amphotericin B or itraconazole. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for blastomycosis.

B: Treat with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics is incorrect because blastomycosis is a fungal infection, not a bacterial infection. Antibiotics are not effective against fungal infections.

C: Treat with topical metronidazole is incorrect because metronidazole is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. Metronidazole is not effective against fungal infections.

D: Treat with topical steroid is incorrect because steroids are not effective against fungal infections. Steroids can actually worsen fungal infections by suppressing the immune system.

 91%|█████████ | 1389/1525 [5:39:50<33:47, 14.91s/it]The correct answer is B: Discontinue diclofenac.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of diclofenac-induced bullous eruption. This is a rare but well-described adverse reaction to diclofenac, typically occurring within 8 hours of taking the medication. The lesions are typically self-limited and resolve within 1-2 weeks of stopping the medication.

A is incorrect because the blisters are likely due to a diclofenac allergy, and continuing the medication could worsen the reaction.

C is incorrect because antihistamines are not effective in treating diclofenac-induced bullous eruption.

D is incorrect because oral corticosteroids are not necessary for mild cases of diclofenac-induced bullous eruption. In severe cases, oral corticosteroids may be necessary, but they should be used with caution in elderly patients due to the risk of side effects.

The best course of management is to discontinue diclofenac and observe the patient for resolution of the lesions. If the lesions do not resolve within 1-2 weeks, or if they worsen, the patient should be seen by a dermatologist.

 91%|█████████ | 1390/1525 [5:39:59<29:21, 13.05s/it]The correct answer is C. Dermatitis herpetiformis.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, autoimmune blistering skin disease that is associated with gluten sensitivity. It is characterized by a symmetrical, intensely pruritic eruption of grouped vesicles and papules on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, particularly the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. The lesions are often in a linear arrangement, as in the case presented.

The diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis is made on the basis of the clinical presentation, the results of a skin biopsy, and the presence of IgA deposits at the dermoepidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence.

The treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis is with a gluten-free diet and dapsone. A gluten-free diet is essential for the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis and should be strictly adhered to. Dapsone is an anti-inflammatory drug that is effective in controlling the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Janeway lesions are small, nonblanching, hemorrhagic lesions that occur on the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. They are a sign of infective endocarditis.
* Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a disorder characterized by a low platelet count. Petechiae are small, purplish spots that occur on the skin and mucous membranes. They are a sign of bleeding due to a low platelet count.
* Petechiae due to pinprick testing are small, purplish spots that occur on the skin at the site of a finger stick. They are caused by trauma to the skin.

 91%|█████████ | 1391/1525 [5:40:12<29:23, 13.16s/it]The correct answer is C. Amyloidosis.

Lichen planus is a chronic skin condition that causes flat, red, itchy patches. It is not associated with nail changes, cutis laxa, or easy bruising.

Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, lungs, eyes, and other organs. It is not associated with nail changes, cutis laxa, or easy bruising.

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss. It is not associated with nail changes, cutis laxa, or easy bruising.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases that are caused by the accumulation of abnormal proteins called amyloid in the organs and tissues. Amyloid can build up in the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system, and other organs. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, weight loss, shortness of breath, and swelling in the hands and feet.

The patient in the case presented with a 1-year history of dystrophic nails, doughy palms, and redundant skin on each side of the gluteal cleft. He also reported easy bruising with minor trauma. Physical examination showed trachyonychia (rough accentuated linear ridges) on 8 fingernails, thin and brittle toenails, diffuse nonscarring alopecia, and multiple purpuric patches on the forehead, scalp, chest, and arms. He had substantial laxity of the skin on finger pads, and both sides of the gluteal cleft revealed soft, nontender, rugated, skin-colored linear kissing plaques with no vesicles, bullae, ulcers, or erosions present.

The histopathologic specimen of the nail bed showed orange, amorphous and extracellular material deposited in the subungual dermis of the nail bed. This material was Congo red positive, which is a characteristic finding of amyloidosis. The same specimen under polarized light microscopy revealed intense apple-green birefringence of the amorphous material in the subungual dermis. This is another characteristic finding of amyloidosis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

 91%|█████████▏| 1392/1525 [5:40:27<30:03, 13.56s/it]The correct answer is C. Fusarium and Mucormycosis.

The patient in this case presented with a 92% TBSA, full-thickness burn after being doused in gasoline and set on fire. He underwent emergent chest, bilateral upper and lower extremity escharotomies, and a decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome. Thirteen days after admission, he required a left upper extremity amputation at the level of the proximal humerus owing to development of nonviable muscle tissue that demonstrated black plaques and white nodules. Once the patient was hemodynamically stable he was taken to the operating room and underwent 4 operations for debridement and grafting, with the initial operation taking place 10 days after admission. His hospital course was complicated by recurrent polymicrobial aspiration pneumonia, caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus. All were successfully treated with antibiotics.

The histopathologic images show black, plaque-shaped growth with hyphae and spores consistent with Fusarium and Mucormycosis. These are both fungal infections that can occur in patients with severe burns. Fusarium is a mold that is commonly found in soil and decaying vegetation. It can enter the body through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract. Mucormycosis is a fungus that is commonly found in soil and decaying organic matter. It can enter the body through the lungs, sinuses, or gastrointestinal tract.

Both Fusarium and Mucormycosis are opportunistic infections, meaning that they occur when the body is weakened by other factors, such as a burn injury. These infections can be life-threatening, and require prompt diagnosis and treatment with antifungal medications.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical presentation of the patient or the histopathologic findings. Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas are bacteria that can cause pneumonia, but they are not associated with Fusarium or Mucormycosis. Candida and Aspergillus are fungi that can cause pneumonia, but they are not associated with the black plaques and white nodules seen in this patient. Cryptococcus and Penicillium are fungi that can cause meningitis, but they are not associated with the black plaques and white nodules seen in this patient.

 91%|█████████▏| 1393/1525 [5:40:34<26:05, 11.86s/it]The correct answer is B: Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging). The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide enough information to make a diagnosis.

A. Treat with prednisolone acetate, 1%, ophthalmic solution 4 times per day is incorrect because this is a topical steroid that is used to treat inflammation. In this case, there is no evidence of inflammation, so this treatment would not be appropriate.

C. Reassure and observe is incorrect because this is a passive approach that does not provide any information about the cause of the lesion. It is important to rule out any serious causes, such as a tumor, before deciding to observe the lesion.

D. Cryotherapy (double–freeze-thaw method) is incorrect because this is a destructive treatment that should only be used after a diagnosis has been made. In this case, it is not possible to know whether the lesion is benign or malignant without further testing.

Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) is the correct answer because it is a non-invasive test that can provide information about the size, shape, and location of the lesion. This information can help to determine the cause of the lesion and the best course of treatment.
It is reasoning
 91%|█████████▏| 1394/1525 [5:40:51<28:46, 13.18s/it]The correct answer is D: Observe.

The lesion is small, has been present for 3 years, and has not caused any visual changes or other symptoms. The patient has no other ocular history and denies a history of trauma. The patient's medical history is unremarkable. The results of the examination are normal, except for the lesion.

A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. Excisional biopsy is the complete removal of the lesion, while incisional biopsy is the removal of a small piece of the lesion. A biopsy is usually performed to determine the cause of a lesion.

In this case, the lesion is small and has been present for 3 years without causing any problems. The patient has no other ocular history and denies a history of trauma. The patient's medical history is unremarkable. The results of the examination are normal, except for the lesion.

Given all of this information, it is reasonable to observe the lesion for now. If the lesion grows, changes in appearance, or causes any problems, then a biopsy can be performed.

Excisional biopsy is not necessary in this case because the lesion is small and has been present for 3 years without causing any problems. Incisional biopsy is not necessary in this case because the lesion is small and has been present for 3 years without causing any problems. Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment, with or without concomitant needle biopsy, is not necessary in this case because the lesion is small and has been present for 3 years without causing any problems.

 91%|█████████▏| 1395/1525 [5:41:04<28:21, 13.09s/it]The correct answer is B. Streptobacillus moniliformis infection.

Streptobacillus moniliformis is a gram-negative rod that is a common cause of rat-bite fever. It is transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected rat, or through contact with the rat's blood or urine. The disease is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia. The rash is typically petechial or pustular, and is most commonly found on the hands and feet. Arthralgia is a common symptom, and can involve multiple joints.

The diagnosis of rat-bite fever is made based on the clinical presentation, the patient's history of exposure to rats, and laboratory findings. The white blood cell count is typically elevated, and there may be an increase in the number of immature white blood cells. Serologic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment of rat-bite fever is with antibiotics. Penicillin is the drug of choice, and is typically given for 10-14 days. Other antibiotics that can be used include ceftriaxone and doxycycline.

The prognosis for rat-bite fever is good with prompt treatment. However, if left untreated, the disease can be fatal.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Disseminated gonococcal infection is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia. However, the rash in disseminated gonococcal infection is typically maculopapular, and is not associated with petechiae or pustules. Additionally, the white blood cell count is typically normal or decreased in disseminated gonococcal infection, not elevated.

C. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness that is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. It is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia. However, the rash in Rocky Mountain spotted fever is typically petechial, and is not associated with pustules. Additionally, the white blood cell count is typically elevated in Rocky Mountain spotted fever, not normal or decreased.

D. Disseminated Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection that is caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by fever, rash, and arthralgia. However, the rash in disseminated Staphylococcus aureus is typically pustular, and is not associated with petechiae. Additionally, the white blood cell count is typically elevated in disseminated Staphylococcus aureus, not normal or decreased.

A gastrocolic fistula is an abnormal connection between the stomach and the colon. It can occur as a result of surgery, inflammation, or infection. Gastrocolic fistulas can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.

The patient in the case presented with a 6-month history of watery diarrhea and severe halitosis. She also lost more than 30 kg of weight during this period. Physical examination revealed acute cachexia with conjunctival pallor and an immobile nontender mass in the left upper abdomen. Her laboratory test results revealed a microcytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Abdominal computed tomography was performed, which showed a large central necrotic mass in the abdomen.

The patient was scheduled for exploratory laparotomy and resection. The surgical findings were consistent with a gastrocolic fistula. The fistula was resected and the patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a chronic infection of the gastrointestinal tract caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, it is unlikely to cause a large central necrotic mass on abdominal computed tomography.
* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with central necrosis is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, it is unlikely to cause a large central necrotic mass on abdominal computed tomography.
* Gastric leiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the stomach. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, it is unlikely to cause a large central necrotic mass on abdominal computed tomography.

 92%|█████████▏| 1397/1525 [5:41:33<29:40, 13.91s/it]The correct answer is B. Meckel diverticulum.

Meckel diverticulum is a common congenital anomaly that occurs in approximately 2% of the population. It is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which is a temporary connection between the yolk sac and the developing intestines in the embryo. Meckel diverticula are most commonly located in the distal ileum, about 2 feet from the ileocecal valve. They can be either true diverticula, which are lined with all three layers of the intestinal wall, or false diverticula, which are lined only with mucosa and submucosa.

Meckel diverticula are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause a variety of problems, including bleeding, inflammation, and obstruction. Bleeding is the most common complication of Meckel diverticulum, and it is usually caused by ulceration of the mucosa in the diverticulum. Inflammation of the diverticulum can lead to appendicitis or Crohn's disease. Obstruction of the bowel can occur if the diverticulum becomes filled with food or feces.

The diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum is usually made with a Meckel scan, which is a nuclear medicine scan that uses a radioactive tracer to detect the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa in the diverticulum. Other tests that may be used to diagnose Meckel diverticulum include upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and abdominal CT scan.

The treatment of Meckel diverticulum depends on the symptoms and complications that are present. If the diverticulum is asymptomatic, it may not require treatment. However, if the diverticulum is causing bleeding, inflammation, or obstruction, it is usually surgically removed.

The answer choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the most likely causes of the patient's symptoms. Intestinal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when two or more segments of intestine develop from the same embryonic tissue. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a type of tumor that can occur in the stomach, small intestine, or colon. Small-bowel diverticular disease is a condition in which diverticula, or small pouches, form in the wall of the small intestine. These conditions are not as common as Meckel diverticulum, and they are not typically associated with the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

The patient is a woman in her 50s who presented to the emergency department with a 3-hour history of sudden epigastric and right upper quadrant pain. She did not report any previous abdominal surgery. The colicky pain did not migrate during that period and occurred in paroxysms at 9- to 10-minute intervals. The patient was afebrile and had no nausea or vomiting. Physical examination revealed mild tachycardia (96/min) and moderate abdominal distension without signs of peritonism; the bowel sounds were hyperactive. Careful examination ruled out incarcerated hernias in the groin, femoral triangle, and obturator foramen. Blood analysis results showed mild leukocytosis (total white blood cell count, 10.5 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001]) without elevation of the C-reactive protein level (<3 mg/L [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524]). Serum electrolyte levels were within the normal range. Computed tomography of the abdomen was conducted (Figure).

The CT scan shows a herniated cecum within the lesser sac. The lesser sac is a peritoneal cavity that is located behind the stomach and lesser omentum. It is separated from the greater peritoneal cavity by the greater omentum and the transverse colon. The epiploic foramen is a small opening in the diaphragm that allows communication between the lesser sac and the greater peritoneal cavity.

Internal hernias through the epiploic foramen are rare, accounting for only 1-2% of all hernias. They are more common in women and in patients with a history of abdominal surgery. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is often made on CT scan. Treatment is usually surgical.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Abscess of the lesser sac is a rare condition that is usually caused by infection from the stomach or duodenum. Perforated ulcer of the posterior stomach wall is a more common condition, but it is usually associated with severe abdominal pain and tenderness. Large diverticle of the transverse colon is a common condition, but it is usually asymptomatic.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen.

 92%|█████████▏| 1399/1525 [5:42:06<32:17, 15.38s/it]The patient is a woman in her 70s who presented with numbness in her hands that had progressively worsened over the last 6 months. She did not have diabetes mellitus and she did not drink alcohol. On physical examination, she had no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly. She had evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (positive Phalen test and Tinel sign bilaterally) and reduced deep tendon reflexes in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Laboratory test results for complete blood cell count, serum calcium, serum creatinine, blood glucose, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, and serum B12 were within normal limits. Because of unexplained neuropathy, a workup to detect an underlying monoclonal gammopathy was done, including serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and free light chain assay (see Table).

The results of the serum protein electrophoresis show a monoclonal gammopathy, which is an abnormal increase in the amount of a single type of immunoglobulin. The immunofixation assay confirms that the monoclonal gammopathy is a kappa light chain gammopathy. The free light chain assay shows an elevated level of kappa light chains in the serum.

The combination of these findings is most consistent with the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is a common condition, affecting about 3% of people over the age of 50. It is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy in the serum, but without any other evidence of disease. MGUS is usually a benign condition, but it can sometimes progress to multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, or other plasma cell disorders.

The patient in this case is at increased risk of developing multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders. However, the risk of progression is low, and the patient should be monitored regularly with blood tests and physical examinations.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Multiple myeloma is a malignant disorder of plasma cells. It is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy, bone marrow infiltration by plasma cells, and lytic bone lesions. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of multiple myeloma.
* Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare malignant disorder of plasma cells. It is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal IgM gammopathy, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of Waldenström macroglobulinemia.
* Light chain monoclonal gammopathy is a condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal light chain in the serum or urine. It can be a benign or malignant condition. The patient in this case has a monoclonal light chain gammopathy, but there is no evidence that it is malignant.

The lesion began as 2 sesame seed–sized violaceous, papulovesicular rashes with an erythematous halo on her left medial malleolus 12 days prior to presentation. Within 1 week, more papulovesicles appeared, merged, and ulcerated spontaneously. The ulceration expanded outwardly at a rapid pace, with increasing pain and a hemorrhagic exudative discharge. The lesion did not respond to treatment with systemic antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem. During the prior 5 months, she experienced mild diarrhea, which was ultimately diagnosed as Crohn disease by colonoscopy with biopsy.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, a rare, autoimmune skin disorder characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers that can occur anywhere on the body. Pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including Crohn disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The first-line treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum is systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Corticosteroids help to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. In most cases, corticosteroids are effective in controlling the disease and preventing further progression of the ulcers.

In some cases, corticosteroids may not be effective or may not be tolerated by the patient. In these cases, other treatments may be used, such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, or infliximab.

Surgery is not usually indicated for pyoderma gangrenosum, but may be necessary to remove necrotic tissue or to repair large ulcers.

In this case, the patient has a rapidly progressing, painful ulceration that has not responded to treatment with systemic antibiotics. The patient also has a history of Crohn disease, which is a known risk factor for pyoderma gangrenosum. Given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum. The first-line treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum is systemic corticosteroids. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Prescribe systemic corticosteroids.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Change dressings daily and implement hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment that involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness, and osteomyelitis. However, there is no evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is effective for pyoderma gangrenosum.

C. Surgically excise the lesion, followed by skin grafting. Surgery is not usually indicated for pyoderma gangrenosum. However, it may be necessary to remove necrotic tissue or to repair large ulcers. In this case, the patient's ulceration is not large enough to warrant surgery.

D. Continue with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. However, they are not effective against pyoderma gangrenosum, which is an autoimmune disorder.

 92%|█████████▏| 1401/1525 [5:42:32<29:17, 14.18s/it]The correct answer is D. Type II non–ST-elevation MI related to acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand.

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She described the pain as “someone sitting on her chest” and reported associated diaphoresis and shortness of breath. She reported nonadherence to blood pressure medications. On physical examination, the heart rate was 99 beats per minute and blood pressure was 247/130 mm Hg. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and inferior T-wave inversion. Laboratory values showed an elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level. An echocardiogram showed moderate LVH with preserved left ventricular systolic function and no segmental wall motion abnormalities. The following day she underwent coronary angiography, which revealed only mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease with a 20% stenosis of the proximal left circumflex coronary artery.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a myocardial infarction (MI). The elevated cTnT level is also consistent with an MI. However, the coronary angiography showed only mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease. This suggests that the MI is not due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which is the most common cause of MI.

A Type II non–ST-elevation MI is an MI that is not caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture. It is most commonly caused by an acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand. This can occur in patients with underlying coronary artery disease, such as the patient in this case. In these patients, an acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand can lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction, even if the coronary arteries are not completely obstructed.

The patient in this case is at high risk for future cardiac events. She has a history of hypertension, which is a major risk factor for MI. She also has nonobstructive coronary artery disease, which is a marker for future MI. She should be treated aggressively to control her hypertension and to reduce her risk of future cardiac events.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the other choices are incorrect:

* Choice A: Chronic elevation in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) due to left ventricular hypertrophy.

This is an incorrect answer because the patient's cTnT level is elevated acutely, which is not consistent with chronic elevation due to LVH.

* Choice B: Elevated cTnT due to skeletal muscle injury.

This is an incorrect answer because the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are not consistent with skeletal muscle injury.

* Choice C: Type I non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture.

This is an incorrect answer because the coronary angiography showed only mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease. This suggests that the MI is not due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture.

 92%|█████████▏| 1402/1525 [5:42:47<29:07, 14.20s/it]The patient has reactive syphilis test results, which indicates that he has been infected with syphilis at some point in the past. However, he does not have any symptoms of syphilis, such as a rash, sores, or lymphadenopathy. This suggests that he has latent syphilis, which is a stage of syphilis in which the infection is present in the body but there are no symptoms.

The recommended treatment for latent syphilis is 2.4 million U intramuscularly of benzathine penicillin G weekly for 3 doses (total 7.2 million U penicillin). This treatment is effective in curing latent syphilis and preventing the development of late-stage syphilis, which can be life-threatening.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice B: The patient does not have low titers representing the serofast state. Serofast state is a condition in which a person has antibodies to syphilis but does not have the infection. This is not the case for the patient in this case, who has reactive syphilis test results.
* Choice C: The patient does not have falsely elevated titers. Falsely elevated titers can occur due to certain medical conditions or medications. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these conditions.
* Choice D: The patient does not need a lumbar puncture to assess for asymptomatic neurosyphilis. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis is a condition in which the syphilis infection has spread to the central nervous system but there are no symptoms. This condition is rare, and it is usually only seen in people with late-stage syphilis. The patient in this case has latent syphilis, so he is not at high risk for developing asymptomatic neurosyphilis.

 92%|█████████▏| 1403/1525 [5:43:00<28:14, 13.89s/it]The correct answer is D. Biopsy the affected tissue.

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and seasonal allergies. She presents with gingival “peeling” associated with pain and bleeding and white patches on the oral mucosa for 7 years. She reports no new medications, foods, or oral hygiene products. She reports no involvement of other cutaneous or mucosal surfaces and no family history of oral lesions. The lesions cause pain and difficulty brushing her teeth.

The intraoral examination shows generalized erythema and sloughing of the maxillary and mandibular gingiva, without evidence of dental plaque, calculus, or both, and white striae (Wickham striae) affecting the gingiva and mucosa. Her physical examination is otherwise normal.

A. Prescribe valacyclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily) for the next 7 days.

Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of gingivitis or other oral lesions.

B. Order a nutritional assay to evaluate for vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency.

Vitamin B3 deficiency can cause a condition called pellagra, which can manifest as oral lesions. However, the patient does not have any of the other characteristic features of pellagra, such as diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. Therefore, it is unlikely that she has a vitamin B3 deficiency.

C. Recommend increased use of an alcohol-based mouthwash to improve oral hygiene.

Alcohol-based mouthwashes can be effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis. However, they are not indicated for the treatment of the patient's specific condition.

D. Biopsy the affected tissue.

A biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose the patient's condition. The most likely diagnosis is desquamative gingivitis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gingiva. Other possible diagnoses include lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, and leukoplakia.

A biopsy will allow the pathologist to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition and recommend appropriate treatment.

 92%|█████████▏| 1404/1525 [5:43:13<27:40, 13.72s/it]The correct answer is C. Hypoplasminogenemia.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and organ failure. Amyloidosis can be caused by a number of different conditions, including hereditary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis, and AL amyloidosis.

Systemic sclerosis is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin, connective tissues, and blood vessels. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including Raynaud's phenomenon, skin tightening, and internal organ involvement. Systemic sclerosis is not curable, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life for people with the disease.

Hypoplasminogenemia is a rare genetic disorder in which the body does not produce enough plasminogen. Plasminogen is a protein that is essential for the body's ability to clot blood. When there is not enough plasminogen, people with hypoplasminogenemia are at risk of bleeding.

Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, eyes, and nervous system. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the protein lipoprotein lipase. Lipoid proteinosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, vision problems, and intellectual disability.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of ligneous conjunctivitis, which is a rare condition that is associated with hypoplasminogenemia. The patient also has easy bruising and prolonged bleeding, which are two of the classic symptoms of hypoplasminogenemia. The biopsy results show aggregates of relatively amorphous, eosinophilic material beneath the epithelium and around blood vessels. This is also consistent with hypoplasminogenemia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hypoplasminogenemia.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Amyloidosis is a rare disease that is not typically associated with ligneous conjunctivitis.
* Systemic sclerosis is a rare disease that is not typically associated with easy bruising and prolonged bleeding.
* Lipoid proteinosis is a rare disease that is not typically associated with ligneous conjunctivitis.

 92%|█████████▏| 1405/1525 [5:43:27<27:29, 13.74s/it]The correct answer is C. Neonatal pemphigus vulgaris.

Neonatal pemphigus vulgaris is a rare, autoimmune blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes of newborns. It is caused by the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein 3, a protein that helps to hold skin cells together. This results in the formation of blisters and erosions, which can be widespread and severe.

The diagnosis of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris is based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and direct immunofluorescence studies. Histopathologic findings typically show suprabasilar acantholysis, which is the separation of the cells in the upper layer of the skin. Direct immunofluorescence studies typically show IgG and C3 deposits in the intercellular space of the lower spinous layer of the skin.

There is no cure for neonatal pemphigus vulgaris, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically involves the use of systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Other treatments that may be used include immunoglobulin therapy, plasmapheresis, and rituximab.

The prognosis for neonatal pemphigus vulgaris varies depending on the severity of the disease. With treatment, most infants will experience a complete remission. However, some infants may have recurrent or persistent disease.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Epidermolysis bullosa, Dowling-Meara type is a genetic disorder that causes blisters to form in the skin and mucous membranes. It is not caused by an autoimmune reaction.
* Neonatal herpesvirus infection is a viral infection that can cause blisters to form in the skin and mucous membranes. It is not caused by an autoimmune reaction.
* Widespread bullous impetigo is a bacterial infection that can cause blisters to form in the skin. It is not caused by an autoimmune reaction.

 92%|█████████▏| 1406/1525 [5:43:42<28:06, 14.17s/it]The correct diagnosis is C. Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis (NSA). This is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous glands that typically presents in children and young adults. The lesions are usually annular or papular, and they may be associated with fever, malaise, and arthralgias. The histopathology is characteristic, showing sebaceous lobules with sebocyte necrosis and an associated neutrophilic infiltrate.

Granuloma annulare is a chronic, non-infectious granulomatous skin disease that can occur at any age. The lesions are typically annular or arciform, and they may be associated with pruritus. The histopathology shows a non-necrotizing granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis.

Cutaneous lupus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. The skin lesions of cutaneous lupus are typically photosensitive, and they may be papular, plaque-like, or annular. The histopathology shows a perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate.

Erythema annulare centrifugum is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that typically presents as an annular lesion on the trunk or extremities. The lesions may be erythematous, violaceous, or hypopigmented. The histopathology shows a perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional eosinophils.

In this case, the patient is a young man with no significant medical history who presents with an annular eruption on the face and upper torso of 2 weeks’ duration. The eruption began on his upper back, at which time he felt well. He then received significant sun exposure while on a 7-day trip to Miami, Florida. After returning from his trip, he noted that the eruption had become more prominent on his back and had spread to his face. In addition, he began to have a febrile illness with joint pain and swollen nodes, which subsequently resolved without treatment. The lesions continued to rapidly enlarge without scaling, and his plaques were not associated with itching or pain. The patient was not taking any medications at the time and denied any recent international travel.

Physical examination revealed multiple annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders on the face, distributed mainly along the forehead and temporal region. There were similar coalescing lesions found on back. No other mucocutaneous findings were noted, and the rest of examination was unremarkable. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained from a plaque on the right upper back and submitted for pathologic review.

The histopathology showed sebaceous lobules with sebocyte necrosis and an associated neutrophilic infiltrate that also includes scattered lymphomononuclear cells. This is the characteristic histopathology of NSA.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is C. Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis (NSA).

Erythema ab igne is a skin condition that is caused by prolonged exposure to heat, such as from a heating pad or fireplace. It is characterized by a reticulated, erythematous plaque with micaceous and silvery scale. The patient in the case presentation has a large, reticulated, erythematous plaque with silvery scale localized to the mid-back, which is consistent with erythema ab igne.

The patient also has a history of stage IV, progressive, neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer. He has undergone numerous chemotherapeutic regimens over the past 3 years, all of which have failed. For the past 4 months he has been receiving oral etoposide (daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle), daily pancrelipase, and monthly octreotide acetate intramuscular injections. The use of chemotherapy can also cause skin problems, such as erythema ab igne. In this case, the patient's erythema ab igne is likely exacerbated by his chemotherapy treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by red, scaly patches of skin. Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare skin condition that is characterized by widespread scaling, erythema, and follicular plugging. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the features of these conditions.

OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the retina. In this case, OCT would be useful to visualize the area of the macula that is affected by the patient's vision loss. This information would help the doctor to determine the cause of the vision loss and to develop a treatment plan.

A. Perform ocular ultrasonography is incorrect because ultrasonography is not as sensitive as OCT in detecting changes in the retina. Additionally, ultrasonography cannot provide the same level of detail as OCT.

C. Obtain blood tests for vasculitis workup is incorrect because the patient's history and examination findings do not suggest that he has vasculitis. Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels, and it can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss. However, the patient's vision loss is most likely due to a different condition, such as age-related macular degeneration.

D. Administer intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent is incorrect because this treatment is not appropriate for the patient's condition. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, a condition that is characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the macula. However, the patient's vision loss is not due to wet age-related macular degeneration.

The patient has acute postoperative visual loss and ophthalmoplegia in the right eye. The most likely cause is a vasospasm of the right internal carotid artery. This can occur after aneurysm surgery, especially in patients who have a history of hypertension or smoking.

Emergent angiography is the best way to diagnose vasospasm. If vasospasm is confirmed, the patient can be treated with vasodilators, such as nimodipine. Angiography can also be used to identify other causes of visual loss, such as a blood clot or a dissection of the internal carotid artery.

Immediate surgical re-exploration is not necessary in this case. The patient has no signs of infection or bleeding. There is no evidence that the aneurysm has ruptured or that there is any other problem with the surgery.

Immediate anticoagulation is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any signs of a blood clot. Anticoagulation could actually worsen the vasospasm.

Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are not necessary in this case. These procedures are used to relieve pressure on the optic nerve in cases of orbital cellulitis or other inflammatory conditions. The patient does not have any signs of infection or inflammation.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Emergent angiography. The patient has acute postoperative visual loss and ophthalmoplegia in the right eye. The most likely cause is a vasospasm of the right internal carotid artery. Emergent angiography is the best way to diagnose and treat this condition.

An infantile myofibroma is a rare, benign tumor that most commonly occurs in infants and young children. It is typically located in the trunk or extremities, and is often solitary. The tumor is composed of spindle-shaped cells that are arranged in a storiform pattern. Infantile myofibromas are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, swelling, or a mass. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies. Treatment is usually not required, but surgical excision may be necessary for symptomatic tumors.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Infantile hemangioma is a common vascular tumor that occurs in infants and young children. It is typically located on the skin, but it can also occur in other organs. Hemangiomas are usually benign, but they can sometimes grow large or cause complications. Treatment is usually not required, but surgical excision or laser therapy may be necessary for symptomatic tumors.
* Neuroblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor that most commonly occurs in children under the age of 5. It is derived from neural crest cells, and can occur anywhere in the body. Neuroblastomas are often aggressive tumors, and can metastasize to other organs. Treatment typically includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
* Dermoid cyst is a common, benign tumor that occurs in the skin. It is typically located on the head or neck, but it can also occur in other parts of the body. Dermoid cysts are lined with skin and hair follicles, and they may contain sebum, sweat, or other debris. Treatment is usually not required, but surgical excision may be necessary for symptomatic cysts.

Sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis (SEP) is a rare, chronic, fibrotic disease of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. It is characterized by the formation of thick, fibrous bands that encase the small intestine, causing obstruction and malabsorption.

The cause of SEP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. It is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people over the age of 50.

The symptoms of SEP vary depending on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, the patient may only experience abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. In more severe cases, the patient may develop intestinal obstruction, malnutrition, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of SEP is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, can help to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for SEP, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life. Treatment options include surgery to remove the affected bowel, medications to reduce inflammation, and nutritional support.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's presentation or the findings on imaging studies.

A. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare cancer that occurs in the lining of the abdomen. It is typically caused by exposure to asbestos. The patient in this case does not have a history of asbestos exposure, and the imaging studies do not show any evidence of cancer.

C. Malrotation with Ladd bands is a congenital anomaly in which the intestines are not properly positioned in the abdomen. It can cause intestinal obstruction, but it is not associated with the findings on imaging studies in this case.

D. Peritoneal encapsulation is a rare condition in which the peritoneum becomes thickened and scarred. It can cause abdominal pain and bloating, but it is not associated with the findings on imaging studies in this case.

 93%|█████████▎| 1412/1525 [5:45:05<26:37, 14.13s/it]The correct answer is B: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

A carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and other organs. Carcinoid tumors are usually slow-growing and rarely metastasize (spread to other parts of the body). However, they can produce hormones that can cause symptoms such as flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing.

A neurofibroma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that arises from nerve tissue. Neurofibromas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin, nerves, and muscles. Neurofibromas can be single or multiple, and they can range in size from small to large. Most neurofibromas are not harmful, but they can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, and weakness.

An intra-abdominal abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the abdomen. Intra-abdominal abscesses can be caused by infection from bacteria, viruses, or parasites. They can also be caused by trauma, surgery, or other medical conditions. Intra-abdominal abscesses can cause symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and nausea.

In the case presented, the patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and melena. He also has a soft, nontender abdomen without obvious palpable masses. Inspection of the patient’s skin demonstrates multiple fleshy, soft cutaneous nodules. The patient’s laboratory testing is only notable for anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. A prior extensive examination, including upper and lower endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through, and capsule endoscopy did not reveal a diagnosis. A computed tomography image of the abdomen and pelvis shows a large, complex, septated, right-upper-quadrant abdominal mass.

Based on the patient’s history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is a GIST. GISTs are mesenchymal tumors that arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are specialized cells that regulate gastrointestinal motility. GISTs are typically found in the stomach and small intestine, but they can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs are often asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and weight loss. GISTs are usually diagnosed with imaging studies such as CT scans or MRIs. Treatment of GISTs depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for localized GISTs. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used to treat advanced GISTs.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Carcinoid tumors are not typically associated with multiple cutaneous nodules.
* Neurofibromas are not typically associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Intra-abdominal abscesses are not typically associated with multiple cutaneous nodules.

 93%|█████████▎| 1413/1525 [5:45:21<27:34, 14.77s/it]The correct answer is A. The patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

Asymptomatic pyuria is the presence of white blood cells in the urine in the absence of symptoms. Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in the urine. Both of these conditions are common in older adults, especially those who are institutionalized.

In this case, the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs. However, she is currently not experiencing any symptoms of a UTI. Her urinalysis shows pyuria, and her urine culture shows bacteriuria. These findings are consistent with asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

It is important to note that asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria are not always caused by a UTI. In some cases, they may be caused by other conditions, such as urinary tract stones or kidney disease. It is also important to note that asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria are not always associated with long-term health problems. However, in some cases, they may increase the risk of developing a UTI or other health problems.

If a patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with their doctor. Treatment may be recommended if the patient is at risk of developing a UTI or other health problems. Treatment may also be recommended if the patient has symptoms of a UTI, even if the urinalysis and urine culture do not show pyuria or bacteriuria.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. The patient has a UTI because of chronic incontinence and a positive urine culture. This is incorrect because the patient is not experiencing any symptoms of a UTI.
* C. A positive urinalysis and urine culture are always a UTI. This is incorrect because asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria are common in older adults, especially those who are institutionalized.
* D. Since the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, these urine test results indicate that she has another UTI. This is incorrect because the patient is not experiencing any symptoms of a UTI.

The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, which are risk factors for brain abscess. The patient also presents with a left facial droop and left leg weakness, which are symptoms of brain abscess. The patient's white blood cell count is normal, which suggests that the infection is not bacterial. Tests for toxoplasma, Lyme disease, cryptococcal antigen, and human immunodeficiency virus are negative, which suggests that the infection is not caused by these organisms. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrates multiloculated ring-enhancing fluid collections involving the right basal ganglia, insula, and frontal lobe. These findings are consistent with brain abscess.

The next step in management is to consult neurosurgery for biopsy. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of brain abscess and to determine the organism responsible for the infection. The patient should then be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

A is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient does not have signs or symptoms of sepsis, and there is no evidence of meningitis. Therefore, intravenous ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole are not necessary at this time.

B is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient does not have signs or symptoms of meningitis. Therefore, lumbar puncture is not necessary at this time.

D is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient does not have signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, systemic corticosteroids are not necessary at this time.

The patient has a history of travel to Puerto Rico, where cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is endemic. CLM is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of hookworms. The larvae penetrate the skin and migrate through the subcutaneous tissues, causing a characteristic serpiginous eruption. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with vesicles or bullae.

The treatment of CLM is oral anthelmintic therapy. The most commonly used drugs are mebendazole and thiabendazole. These drugs kill the larvae and prevent further migration. Treatment is usually effective and the lesions resolve within a few weeks.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Do nothing; it will resolve with time is incorrect because CLM is a self-limiting infection, but it can take several weeks to resolve without treatment. Treatment with oral anthelmintic therapy will shorten the duration of the infection and prevent complications.
* Option B: Prescribe topical steroids is incorrect because topical steroids will not kill the larvae and may actually worsen the infection.
* Option D: Prescribe oral antibiotics is incorrect because antibiotics are not effective against CLM.

 93%|█████████▎| 1416/1525 [5:45:59<23:10, 12.76s/it]The correct answer is B. The patient has LTBI.

A positive TST result indicates that the patient has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB). However, a positive TST result does not necessarily mean that the patient has active TB disease. In fact, most people with a positive TST result have LTBI, which is an infection with MTB but no active disease.

LTBI is a common condition, especially in people who live in or have traveled to areas with a high prevalence of TB. In the United States, about 1 in 10 people have LTBI.

Most people with LTBI never develop active TB disease. However, some people, especially those with weakened immune systems, may develop active TB disease years after being infected with MTB.

There is no cure for LTBI, but it can be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for LTBI is recommended for people who are at high risk for developing active TB disease, such as those with HIV infection, diabetes, or a history of organ transplantation.

The IGRA is a blood test that is used to diagnose LTBI. The IGRA is more sensitive than the TST, meaning that it is more likely to detect LTBI in people who have been infected with MTB.

The IGRA results in the case study are consistent with LTBI. The patient has a positive TST result and a positive IGRA result. The patient also has risk factors for TB, such as being from a high-TB–incidence country.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is LTBI. The patient should be treated with antibiotics to prevent the development of active TB disease.

The other choices are incorrect.

Choice A is incorrect because the patient does not have active TB disease. The patient has LTBI, which is an infection with MTB but no active disease.

Choice C is incorrect because the patient does not need further evaluation for LTBI. The patient has already been diagnosed with LTBI based on the TST and IGRA results.

Choice D is incorrect because the patient does not need further evaluation for active TB disease. The patient has already been diagnosed with LTBI, which is an infection with MTB but no active disease.

This is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that most commonly affects the nasal cavity and sinuses. However, it can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.

The most common symptoms of Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type are nasal obstruction, facial pain, and epistaxis (nosebleed). Other symptoms may include headache, fever, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type is made based on a biopsy of the affected tissue. The biopsy will show a characteristic infiltration of the tissue by large, atypical lymphocytes.

There is no cure for Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, but treatment can help to control the disease and improve the quality of life for patients. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that affects the skin. It is not associated with angiocentrism, which is the infiltration of blood vessels by lymphocytes.
* Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is not associated with EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization, which is a test that is used to detect the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
* Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that affects the subcutaneous fat. It is not associated with angiocentrism or EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of small, dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. HHT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene from one parent to develop the condition. The most common symptoms of HHT are epistaxis (nosebleeds), telangiectasias on the skin and mucous membranes, and internal bleeding from telangiectasias in the lungs, brain, or gastrointestinal tract. HHT can also lead to other complications, such as heart problems, stroke, and seizures.

Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a rare disorder characterized by the development of small, dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) in the skin. CCV is thought to be caused by damage to the collagen in the skin, which leads to the formation of telangiectasias. CCV can cause a variety of symptoms, including telangiectasias on the skin, itching, burning, and pain. CCV can also lead to complications, such as ulcerations of the skin and infections.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies that attack the body's own tissues. SLE can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. SLE can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, rash, joint pain, and kidney problems. SLE can also lead to serious complications, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 50s who presented with “speckled” red lesions on her bilateral arms, lower legs, and feet. They had first appeared on her lower legs 15 years ago and were slowly increasing in number and spreading to involve her feet and bilateral upper extremities. The patient denied tenderness, pruritus, and edema. She reported no family history of this problem and denied any personal history of anemia, epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or hemoptysis. She had a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse, requiring treatment with losartan and atorvastatin.

The physical examination revealed punctate, blanchable telangiectasias coalescing to form large, retiform patches on her bilateral lower extremities, feet, and upper extremities. There was no conjunctival or mucosal involvement. The patient reported no dermatographism or purpura. Histologic findings from a biopsy specimen showed dilated, ectatic vessels in the superficial dermis with no associated inflammation or fibrinoid necrosis.

Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is generalized essential telangiectasia. Generalized essential telangiectasia is a common, benign condition characterized by the development of small, dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) in the skin. The cause of generalized essential telangiectasia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Generalized essential telangiectasia is usually not associated with any other health problems. However, in some cases, it can lead to complications, such as bleeding, infection, and ulcerations of the skin.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* HHT is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of small, dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. The patient in this case does not have any history of epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or hemoptysis, which are common symptoms of HHT. Additionally, the patient's physical examination does not show any evidence of telangiectasias in the mucous membranes or internal organs.
* CCV is a rare disorder characterized by the development of small, dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) in the skin. The patient in this case does not have any history of itching, burning, or pain, which are common symptoms of CCV. Additionally, the patient's physical examination does not show any evidence of ulcerations of the skin.
* SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies that attack the body's own tissues. The patient in this case does not have any history of fatigue, fever, rash, joint pain, or kidney problems, which are common symptoms of SLE. Additionally, the patient's physical examination does not show any evidence of inflammation or fibrinoid necrosis.

 93%|█████████▎| 1419/1525 [5:46:42<24:41, 13.98s/it]The correct diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), also known as histiocytosis X. LCH is a rare, non-cancerous disorder that affects the Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. The symptoms of LCH can vary depending on the part of the body that is affected. In this case, the patient presented with tender, reddish brown, slightly pruritic papules and plaques on the scalp, in the inframammary region, and in the perineum. These symptoms are consistent with LCH, which often affects the skin, bones, and lymph nodes.

The patient's history and physical examination also support a diagnosis of LCH. The patient had been experiencing the symptoms for approximately 1 year, and previous treatment with multiple courses of topical and systemic antifungals, topical and systemic corticosteroids, and oral antibiotics had failed. This suggests that the patient's condition is not caused by a fungal infection, a bacterial infection, or psoriasis.

The biopsy specimen of the plaque along the left inframammary region shows abundant atypical cells within the epidermis and papillary dermis. These cells are consistent with Langerhans cells, which are characteristic of LCH.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of LCH. The biopsy specimen of the plaque along the left inframammary region also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Intertrigo is a common skin condition that occurs in areas where skin rubs together, such as the groin, armpits, and under the breasts. It is characterized by redness, itching, and inflammation. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with intertrigo.
* Hailey-Hailey disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes the skin to peel and blister. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of blisters and erosions in the skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with Hailey-Hailey disease.
* Inverse psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that affects the skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. It is characterized by red, scaly plaques that are often moist and inflamed. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with inverse psoriasis.

A. Reassure and observe is not the correct answer because the patient has vision loss. OCT imaging is a more accurate test to determine the extent of the damage and whether there is any potential for recovery.

C. Evaluate for secondary gain is not the correct answer because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient is malingering. The patient's symptoms are consistent with the history of trauma and the physical examination findings.

D. Electroretinogram is not the correct answer because it is not a sensitive test for detecting retinal damage. OCT imaging is a more accurate test to determine the extent of the damage and whether there is any potential for recovery.

OCT imaging is a non-invasive test that uses light to create cross-sectional images of the retina. It is a very accurate test for detecting retinal damage and can be used to monitor the progression of disease. In this case, OCT imaging would be helpful to determine the extent of the damage to the macula and to assess whether there is any potential for recovery.

The patient in this case presents with bilateral neuroretinitis and retinal hemorrhages. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a severe, bilateral, necrotizing retinitis caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). ARN is a sight-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.

The gold standard for diagnosing ARN is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of aqueous humor. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect VZV DNA in the eye. A positive PCR result is diagnostic of ARN.

Anterior chamber paracentesis is a procedure in which a small amount of fluid is removed from the anterior chamber of the eye. This fluid can then be tested for VZV DNA using PCR. Anterior chamber paracentesis is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed in the office.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate diagnostic tests for ARN. Diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is not necessary for the diagnosis of ARN. Neuroimaging of brain and orbits is not necessary for the diagnosis of ARN. Blood cultures are not necessary for the diagnosis of ARN.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Anterior chamber paracentesis for polymerase chain reaction. This is the most appropriate diagnostic test for ARN because it is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect VZV DNA in the eye.

 93%|█████████▎| 1422/1525 [5:47:22<23:43, 13.82s/it]The correct diagnosis is microcystic lymphatic malformation. This is a type of vascular malformation that is characterized by the presence of small, dilated lymphatic channels in the skin. The lesions are typically soft, compressible, and translucent, and they may be grouped together or scattered. They can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, and they may be present at birth or develop later in life. Microcystic lymphatic malformations are usually benign, but they can sometimes cause cosmetic problems or complications, such as infection or bleeding. Treatment options include observation, laser therapy, or surgical excision.

Congenital melanocytic nevus is a type of birthmark that is caused by an abnormal growth of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. The lesions are typically flat or raised, and they may be brown, black, or blue in color. They can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, and they may be present at birth or develop later in life. Congenital melanocytic nevi are usually benign, but they can sometimes develop into melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Treatment options include observation, excision, or laser therapy.

Venous malformation is a type of vascular malformation that is characterized by the presence of abnormal veins. The lesions are typically soft, compressible, and blue or purple in color. They can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters, and they may be present at birth or develop later in life. Venous malformations are usually benign, but they can sometimes cause cosmetic problems or complications, such as bleeding or infection. Treatment options include observation, sclerotherapy, or surgical excision.

Nevus sebaceous is a type of birthmark that is characterized by the presence of a raised, pigmented lesion. The lesions are typically present at birth, and they may grow larger over time. They are usually benign, but they can sometimes develop into skin cancer. Treatment options include observation, excision, or laser therapy.

In this case, the patient presented with a lesion that was present at birth and had gradually enlarged over time. The lesion was soft, compressible, and translucent, and it was located on the posterior thigh. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of microcystic lymphatic malformation.

 93%|█████████▎| 1423/1525 [5:47:37<23:58, 14.10s/it]The correct answer is A. Dropped gallstones.

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy approximately 6 years ago. She presents with abdominal pain and jaundice. The physical examination is unremarkable. The laboratory findings are remarkable for a total bilirubin level of 6.8 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 394 U/L, an alanine transaminase level of 746 U/L, and an alkaline phosphatase level of 1146 U/L. The imaging studies show a 3 × 4-cm circumferential lesion in the second and third portions of the duodenum involving the pancreatic head, as well as multiple nodules along the peritoneal reflection of the right paracolic gutter.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a variety of conditions, including pancreatitis, pancreatic neoplasm, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and metastatic disease. However, the most likely diagnosis is dropped gallstones. Dropped gallstones are a rare complication of cholecystitis, and they typically occur in patients who have had a previous cholecystectomy. The gallstones can migrate through the common bile duct and into the duodenum, where they can become lodged and cause obstruction. This can lead to abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis.

The diagnosis of dropped gallstones is often made on clinical grounds, based on the patient's history and presentation. Imaging studies, such as abdominal CT scan, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment of dropped gallstones typically involves surgical removal of the gallstones. In some cases, endoscopic removal of the gallstones may be possible.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system. It is not typically associated with abdominal pain, jaundice, or pancreatitis.
* Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a metastatic disease of the peritoneum. It is typically associated with a history of cancer, such as ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer.
* Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare malignancy of the peritoneum. It is typically associated with exposure to asbestos.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign, self-limiting soft tissue tumor that is most common in young adults. It is characterized by a rapid growth of a firm, painless mass that is often located in the extremities. The lesion is typically well-circumscribed and may have a pseudocapsule. On imaging, nodular fasciitis is typically hypoechoic on ultrasound and has low signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI. It may enhance with contrast.

The etiology of nodular fasciitis is unknown, but it is thought to be a reactive lesion that may be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation. The lesion is usually diagnosed on clinical grounds and confirmed by biopsy. Nodular fasciitis is treated with surgical excision, which is curative.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive fibromatosis that most commonly occurs in the abdominal wall. It is characterized by a slow, progressive growth of a firm, painless mass. The lesion is typically poorly circumscribed and does not have a pseudocapsule. On imaging, desmoid fibromatosis is typically isoechoic on ultrasound and has low signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI. It may enhance with contrast.
* Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a rare, intermediate-grade soft tissue tumor that most commonly occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by a rapid growth of a firm, painful mass that is often located in the extremities. The lesion is typically poorly circumscribed and does not have a pseudocapsule. On imaging, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is typically hypoechoic on ultrasound and has high signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI. It may enhance with contrast.
* Leiomyosarcoma is a rare, malignant soft tissue tumor that most commonly occurs in adults. It is characterized by a slow, progressive growth of a firm, painless mass.

The patient has a history of travel to a region where leishmaniasis is endemic, and he has skin lesions that are consistent with leishmaniasis. The biopsy of the nasal tissue revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, a lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, with no organisms found using special staining. This is a non-specific finding that could be seen with a variety of conditions, including leishmaniasis.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that is caused by Leishmania protozoa. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies. The most common form of leishmaniasis in the Americas is cutaneous leishmaniasis, which affects the skin. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can present with a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, ulcers, and scars.

The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is made based on clinical findings, history of travel to an endemic area, and laboratory testing. The gold standard for diagnosis is a positive culture of Leishmania parasites from a biopsy specimen. However, culture can be difficult and time-consuming. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is a more sensitive and specific test for leishmaniasis.

Treatment for leishmaniasis depends on the form of the disease and the severity of the infection. Mild cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis can be treated with topical or oral medications. Severe cases may require systemic therapy with injectable medications.

In this case, the patient has a history of travel to a region where leishmaniasis is endemic, and he has skin lesions that are consistent with leishmaniasis. The biopsy of the nasal tissue revealed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, a lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, with no organisms found using special staining. This is a non-specific finding that could be seen with a variety of conditions, including leishmaniasis.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous leishmaniasis. The next step in management is to perform leishmaniasis polymerase chain reaction testing of the biopsied tissue. If the test is positive, the patient will be treated with appropriate anti-leishmanial medications.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A: Obtain immunofluorescence of biopsied tissue. Immunofluorescence is a technique that is used to detect the presence of specific antigens in tissue. It is not a sensitive or specific test for leishmaniasis.
* B: Perform biopsy with oncology consultation. A biopsy with oncology consultation is not indicated in this case. The patient does not have any clinical findings that are concerning for malignancy.
* D: Prescribe intravenous vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. There is no evidence that the patient has an MRSA infection.

Flow cytometry is a technique that uses a laser to measure the light scattered by cells as they pass through a stream of fluid. This technique can be used to identify and quantify different types of cells, as well as to measure the expression of specific proteins on the surface of cells.

In this case, the patient has a lymphocytic predominance in their peripheral blood smear. This suggests that they may have a lymphoproliferative disorder, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Flow cytometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of CLL and to determine the stage of the disease.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A mononucleosis test would not be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of mononucleosis (fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy).
* An excisional lymph node biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary, as flow cytometry can provide the same information with less risk.
* A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast would not be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of a malignancy.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that typically presents with tender, erythematous plaques or nodules on the skin. It is often associated with underlying malignancy, hematologic disorders, or autoimmune diseases. The patient in this case does not have any of these underlying conditions, so Sweet syndrome is unlikely.

Herpes genitalis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It typically presents with painful, vesicular lesions on the genitals. The patient in this case does not have any genital lesions, so herpes genitalis is unlikely.

Deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection is a rare, serious infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is often seen in immunocompromised patients. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection, so it is unlikely.

Perivulvar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is a rare, inflammatory skin condition that affects the apocrine glands in the groin, armpits, and perianal area. It is characterized by tender, erythematous nodules and plaques. The patient in this case has all of the characteristic features of NEH, so it is the most likely diagnosis.

In addition to the clinical presentation, the histopathologic findings from the punch biopsy of the perivulvar lesions are also consistent with NEH. The biopsy showed spongiosis and hyperplasia of the epidermis with neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis. Necrotic collagen and eccrine gland destruction were also seen. These findings are all characteristic of NEH.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is perivulvar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH).

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the rapid growth of skin cells. This results in thick, red, scaly patches of skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.

Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, and nails. It is characterized by flat, purplish-red bumps that are often itchy. Lichen planus can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most commonly found on the inner surfaces of the cheeks, the genitals, and the lower legs.

Cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. It occurs when the donor T cells in the transplanted bone marrow attack the recipient's tissues. Cutaneous GVHD can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly found on the skin, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet.

The patient in the case report has multiple hyperkeratotic purplish brown papules and plaques on both buttocks, more confluent in the perianal area, with well-demarcated slightly elevated keratotic margins. Dermoscopy showed structureless brownish pigmentation and erythema in the center, demarcated by a white-yellow hyperkeratotic scale at the periphery. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of porokeratosis ptychotropica.

Porokeratosis ptychotropica is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by hyperkeratotic papules and plaques that are often pruritic. The lesions are typically found on the sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, neck, hands, and forearms. The cause of porokeratosis ptychotropica is unknown, but it is thought to be an inherited condition. There is no cure for porokeratosis ptychotropica, but the lesions can be treated with topical medications or laser therapy.

The lesions typically coalesce into large, reticulated plaques that may be associated with pigmentary changes. The condition is most common in children and young adults, and there is no known cure. Treatment is aimed at relieving the pruritus and preventing secondary infection.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a benign skin condition characterized by the appearance of multiple, confluent, reticulated papules on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but may be pruritic in some cases. CRP is more common in older adults, and there is no known cure. Treatment is aimed at relieving the pruritus.
* Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the appearance of linear bands of IgA deposition at the dermoepidermal junction. The lesions typically present as vesicles and bullae on an erythematous base, and may be associated with mucosal involvement. LABD is most common in children, but can occur at any age.

The patient in this case has a diffusely swollen eyelid, which was initially diagnosed as a chalazion. However, the lesion increased in size despite conservative measures and was subsequently found to be a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a cancer of the lymphatic system.

The most common cause of DLBCL is EBV, a virus that is most commonly spread through saliva. EBV infection is usually asymptomatic, but it can sometimes lead to more serious conditions, such as mononucleosis or lymphoma.

In this case, it is important to determine whether the patient is infected with EBV. If the patient is infected, then treatment with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets EBV-infected cells, may be indicated. However, if the patient is not infected with EBV, then other treatment options, such as radiation and chemotherapy, may be necessary.

It is also important to consider the patient's medical history. The patient in this case has rheumatoid arthritis, which has been well controlled with methotrexate for 15 years. Methotrexate is a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and psoriasis. However, methotrexate can also suppress the immune system, which can increase the risk of developing lymphoma.

In this case, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing methotrexate therapy. If the patient is not infected with EBV, then continuing methotrexate therapy may be a safe option. However, if the patient is infected with EBV, then discontinuing methotrexate therapy may be necessary to reduce the risk of lymphoma progression.

Overall, the best course of treatment for this patient will depend on a number of factors, including the patient's EBV status, the patient's medical history, and the patient's overall health. It is important to discuss all of the treatment options with the patient and to make a decision that is best for the patient.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Initiate treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy is incorrect because the patient's EBV status is unknown. If the patient is infected with EBV, then treatment with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets EBV-infected cells, may be indicated. However, if the patient is not infected with EBV, then other treatment options, such as radiation and chemotherapy, may be necessary.
* B. Initiate treatment with rituximab is incorrect because the patient's EBV status is unknown. If the patient is infected with EBV, then treatment with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets EBV-infected cells, may be indicated. However, if the patient is not infected with EBV, then other treatment options, such as radiation and chemotherapy, may be necessary.

Drainage of the choroidal effusion is not the correct answer because it would not address the underlying cause of the choroidal effusion, which is the high intraocular pressure. In addition, drainage of the choroidal effusion could lead to complications, such as infection and bleeding.

Oral steroids are not the correct answer because they are not effective in treating choroidal effusions. In fact, steroids can worsen choroidal effusions by increasing the permeability of blood vessels.

Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is not the correct answer because it is not effective in treating choroidal effusions. Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, which is a different condition.

Oral propranolol is the correct answer because it is a beta-blocker that can lower intraocular pressure. Beta-blockers work by blocking the effects of the hormone epinephrine, which causes blood vessels to constrict. This constriction of blood vessels leads to a decrease in blood flow to the eye, which in turn leads to a decrease in intraocular pressure.

In the case of this patient, oral propranolol is the best treatment option because it will address the underlying cause of the choroidal effusion, which is the high intraocular pressure. In addition, oral propranolol is a safe and effective treatment for choroidal effusions.

The other answer choices are not the correct answers because they do not address the underlying cause of the choroidal effusion or they are not effective in treating choroidal effusions.

 94%|█████████▍| 1433/1525 [5:49:51<20:48, 13.57s/it]The correct answer is B. Incontinentia pigmenti.

Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare, X-linked dominant genetic disorder that affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails, eyes, and central nervous system. It is characterized by a linear band of skin-colored papules that are present at birth and persist throughout life. The papules may eventually develop into blisters, erosions, and scarring. Incontinentia pigmenti is a lifelong condition, but the severity of the symptoms can vary from person to person.

The diagnosis of incontinentia pigmenti is based on the patient's history and physical examination. There is no specific test for the condition, but a skin biopsy can be helpful in making the diagnosis.

There is no cure for incontinentia pigmenti, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include topical medications, oral medications, and surgery.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms. Varicella-zoster virus is the virus that causes chickenpox. Chickenpox is characterized by a rash of blisters that appear in a widespread distribution. Herpes simplex virus is the virus that causes cold sores and genital herpes. Herpes simplex virus infections are characterized by a cluster of blisters that appear on the lips, mouth, genitals, or buttocks. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, noncancerous disorder of the white blood cells. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells in the skin, bone, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Incontinentia pigmenti. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms.

 94%|█████████▍| 1434/1525 [5:50:07<21:48, 14.37s/it]The correct answer is C. Small-bowel volvulus. The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of vomiting and abdominal pain once a year that started 10 years earlier. She had always been diagnosed as having adhesive ileus, and her symptoms always improved within a day after hospital admission. Her current presentation with vomiting and acute abdominal pain that started 24 hours earlier is concerning for a small-bowel volvulus.

A small-bowel volvulus is a twisting of the small intestine that can cause obstruction and ischemia. The most common type of small-bowel volvulus is a volvulus of the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. Other types of small-bowel volvulus include volvulus of the jejunum (the middle part of the small intestine) and volvulus of the ileum (the last part of the small intestine).

The symptoms of small-bowel volvulus can vary depending on the severity of the obstruction and the amount of ischemia. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, vomiting, and distention. Other symptoms may include fever, diarrhea, and dehydration.

The diagnosis of small-bowel volvulus is made with a CT scan of the abdomen. The CT scan will show the twisted small intestine and the amount of obstruction.

The treatment of small-bowel volvulus is surgery. The goal of surgery is to untwist the small intestine and restore blood flow. If the small intestine is severely damaged, it may need to be removed.

The prognosis for small-bowel volvulus depends on the severity of the obstruction and the amount of ischemia. If the small intestine is not severely damaged, the prognosis is good. However, if the small intestine is severely damaged, the prognosis is poor.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Intussusception is a condition in which one part of the intestine telescopes into another part of the intestine. This can cause blockage of the intestine and ischemia. However, intussusception is more common in children than in adults.
* Colon cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the colon. Colon cancer can cause blockage of the intestine and ischemia. However, colon cancer is more common in people over the age of 50.
* Mesenteric ischemia is a condition in which the blood supply to the small intestine is blocked. This can cause blockage of the intestine and ischemia. However, mesenteric ischemia is more common in people with underlying medical conditions, such as atherosclerosis or diabetes.

The patient has a large (12-cm) incisional hernia that contains abdominal contents, including the liver, ascending colon, and omental fat. This type of hernia is not amenable to laparoscopic repair, as the defect is too large and the contents are too bulky. A video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) reduction would not be appropriate because it would not provide adequate exposure for repair of the defect. A transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement would also not be appropriate because the defect is located in the thoracic cavity.

The correct procedure is a right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement. This procedure will allow for adequate exposure of the defect and allow for placement of a mesh to reinforce the closure. The mesh will help to prevent recurrence of the hernia.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not provide adequate exposure for repair of the defect or do not allow for placement of a mesh.

 94%|█████████▍| 1436/1525 [5:50:34<20:21, 13.73s/it]The correct answer is B. Endothelial adrenal cyst.

The patient is a woman in her 30s with a history of chronic hepatitis B. She was found on computed tomography to have a 13-cm retroperitoneal mass on her left side with a significant mass effect. The patient was symptomatic with intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain that was associated with nausea and constipation. She reported no other gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or overall symptoms. In addition to chronic hepatitis B, her medical history was notable for hypertension and her surgical history was significant for a recent liver biopsy. Physical examination revealed a soft, nontender, minimally distended abdomen with no palpable masses and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory test results at presentation revealed complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and amylase values within the reference ranges and a hepatitis B virus quantification level of 1590 IU/mL. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis using intravenous contrast was obtained (Figure 1).

The computed tomographic scan shows a well-defined, round, cystic mass in the left adrenal gland. The mass is approximately 13 cm in diameter and has a thin, smooth wall. The mass does not enhance with intravenous contrast. These findings are consistent with an endothelial adrenal cyst.

Endothelial adrenal cysts are benign, non-functioning cysts that arise from the adrenal cortex. They are the most common type of adrenal cyst, accounting for approximately 60% of all adrenal cysts. Endothelial adrenal cysts are typically asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally cause symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Endothelial adrenal cysts are typically diagnosed on imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgical resection may be indicated for symptomatic cysts or cysts that are large or complex.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are benign tumors that arise from the pancreatic ducts. They are the most common type of pancreatic cyst, accounting for approximately 70% of all pancreatic cysts. Serous cystadenomas are typically asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally cause symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Serous cystadenomas are typically diagnosed on imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgical resection may be indicated for symptomatic cysts or cysts that are large or complex.
* C. Retroperitoneal abscess: A retroperitoneal abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the retroperitoneum, the space behind the abdominal organs. Retroperitoneal abscesses can be caused by a variety of infections, including bacterial infections, fungal infections, and parasitic infections. Retroperitoneal abscesses are typically diagnosed on imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is typically with antibiotics and surgical drainage.
* D. Pheochromocytoma: A pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine-secreting tumor that arises from the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas are typically diagnosed in adults, but they can occur in children. Pheochromocytomas can cause a variety of symptoms, including hypertension, headache, sweating, palpitations, and anxiety. Pheochromocytomas are typically diagnosed with blood tests, such as plasma catecholamine levels and urinary catecholamine levels. Treatment is typically with surgery to remove the tumor.

 94%|█████████▍| 1437/1525 [5:50:51<21:34, 14.71s/it]The correct answer is A. Consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding; obtain a CT scan of the lung and abdomen and offer genetic counseling for the patient and her family.

The patient has a number of concerning symptoms, including an acute onset of headache, increasing right-side hemiparesis, and numbness with fever. The CT scan of the brain shows a ring-enhanced lesion with surrounding edema on the left frontoparietal lobe, which is highly suggestive of a brain abscess. Brain abscesses are typically caused by infection with bacteria, fungi, or parasites. In this case, the patient's history of epistaxis suggests that she may have a sinus infection, which could be the source of the brain abscess.

The red papules on the tongue are also concerning. They could be a sign of a number of different conditions, including infectious mononucleosis, measles, or scarlet fever. However, in the context of the patient's other symptoms, they are more likely to be a sign of a systemic infection, such as sepsis.

The patient's blood cultures were negative, which means that the infection is not likely to be bacterial. However, it is still important to identify the source of the infection so that it can be treated. A CT scan of the lung and abdomen can help to identify any potential sources of infection, such as pneumonia or abscesses in the lungs or abdomen.

Genetic counseling is also important in this case because the patient's symptoms are consistent with a number of genetic syndromes that are associated with brain abscesses. These syndromes include neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis complex, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Genetic counseling can help the patient and her family to understand the risks of these syndromes and to make informed decisions about their care.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Choice B, Consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding; obtain a dermatology consultation and refer the patient to interventional radiology, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a dermatological condition. The red papules on the tongue are more likely to be a sign of a systemic infection.
* Choice C, Continue intravenous antibiotics only, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a simple bacterial infection. The infection is more likely to be systemic, and it is important to identify the source of the infection so that it can be treated.
* Choice D, Obtain a biopsy of the tongue lesions, is incorrect because the biopsy will not provide any additional information that is not already available from the CT scan of the brain and the blood cultures. The biopsy may also be risky, as it could introduce infection into the brain.

 94%|█████████▍| 1438/1525 [5:51:05<20:47, 14.33s/it]The patient does not have hepatic encephalopathy so no treatment is necessary.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a neurological disorder that can develop in people with liver disease. It is caused by a build-up of ammonia in the brain, which can lead to symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, and seizures.

The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. His serum ammonia level is normal, and he is alert and oriented with normal cognitive function. Therefore, he does not need to be treated for hepatic encephalopathy.

The other choices are incorrect because they are based on the assumption that the patient has hepatic encephalopathy, which is not the case.

A. The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and should be treated.

This is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. His serum ammonia level is normal, and he is alert and oriented with normal cognitive function. Therefore, he does not need to be treated for hepatic encephalopathy.

B. The patient has subclinical hepatic encephalopathy and should be treated.

This is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. His serum ammonia level is normal, and he is alert and oriented with normal cognitive function. Therefore, he does not need to be treated for subclinical hepatic encephalopathy.

C. The patient is at high risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy and should be prophylactically treated.

This is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. His serum ammonia level is normal, and he is alert and oriented with normal cognitive function. Therefore, he does not need to be prophylactically treated for hepatic encephalopathy.

 94%|█████████▍| 1439/1525 [5:51:15<18:39, 13.01s/it]The correct answer is D. Start systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

The patient has a history of myelofibrosis and has undergone a stem cell transplant. He is now presenting with a nonpruritic rash on his face, trunk, and extremities. The rash is associated with intermittent fever, muscle pain, and weakness.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition that occurs when immune cells from the donor transplant attack the tissues of the recipient. GVHD can affect the skin, liver, gut, lungs, eyes, and other organs.

The most common treatment for GVHD is systemic immunosuppressive therapy. This involves using medications to suppress the immune system. The goal of treatment is to control the GVHD while minimizing the risk of side effects.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for GVHD.

* Order anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and antihistone antibody tests: These tests are used to diagnose autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. They are not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with GVHD.
* Obtain a skin punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis: A skin biopsy can be helpful in diagnosing GVHD. However, it is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with GVHD.
* Start high-potency topical steroid, topical calcineurin inhibitor, or both: Topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are used to treat mild to moderate GVHD. However, they are not effective in treating severe GVHD.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Start systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

 94%|█████████▍| 1440/1525 [5:51:30<19:36, 13.84s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform orbitotomy with biopsy.

The patient has a left superomedial orbital mass that is infiltrating the extraconal and intraconal space. This is a concerning finding, as it could represent a number of serious conditions, including malignancy. The next step in management is to obtain a biopsy of the mass to determine its underlying cause. This can be done through an orbitotomy, which is a surgical procedure to access the orbit.

Observing the patient without further intervention is not appropriate, as this could allow the mass to grow and potentially cause further damage to the eye and orbit. Administering empirical corticosteroid treatment is also not appropriate, as this could mask the underlying cause of the mass and make it more difficult to diagnose. External beam radiotherapy is not a first-line treatment for orbital masses, as it can cause significant side effects, such as radiation damage to the eye.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform orbitotomy with biopsy. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the mass and appropriate treatment to be initiated.

 94%|█████████▍| 1441/1525 [5:51:41<17:51, 12.76s/it]The correct answer is A. Observe.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a self-limited inflammatory condition of the retina that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by the sudden onset of floaters, blurry vision, and shimmering lights. The fundus examination typically reveals multiple, small, yellow-white lesions in the posterior retina.

The treatment of APMPPE is generally supportive. There is no evidence that oral or topical corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of APMPPE. Intravitreal antibiotics are also not indicated, as APMPPE is a non-infectious condition.

The best course of management for a patient with APMPPE is to observe them closely. The vast majority of patients with APMPPE will experience spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within a few weeks to months. In rare cases, APMPPE can lead to permanent visual loss. However, this is usually only seen in patients with severe disease.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Observe. The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of APMPPE, which is a self-limited inflammatory condition of the retina. There is no evidence that oral or topical corticosteroids or intravitreal antibiotics are effective in the treatment of APMPPE. The best course of management is to observe the patient closely.

Coccidioides immitis is a fungus that is found in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America. It can be inhaled into the lungs, where it can cause an infection called coccidioidomycosis.

Coccidioidomycosis is most common in people who live in or have traveled to areas where the fungus is found in the soil. It is also more common in people who are exposed to dust that is contaminated with the fungus.

Coccidioidomycosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, chest pain, fatigue, and weight loss. In some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, joints, and skin.

Coccidioidomycosis is usually diagnosed with a blood test or a chest X-ray. Treatment for coccidioidomycosis depends on the severity of the infection. In most cases, the infection can be treated with antifungal medications.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, weight loss, and night sweats. It is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any of the classic symptoms of tuberculosis, such as a cough that lasts for more than three weeks.

B. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and weight loss. It is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any of the classic symptoms of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, such as a cough that lasts for more than three weeks.

Splenic lymphangiomatosis is a rare non-neoplastic disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation of lymphatic vessels in the spleen. It is typically seen in young women, and can present with a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, early satiety, back pain, and splenomegaly. Splenic lymphangiomatosis can be diagnosed with cross-sectional imaging, such as CT scan or MRI, which will show characteristic findings of enlarged lymphangiectasias in the spleen.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Splenic pelosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of hair in the spleen. It is typically seen in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and is not associated with the symptoms described in the case.
* Echinococcal splenic cystic disease is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It is typically seen in patients who have traveled to areas where the tapeworm is endemic, and is not associated with the symptoms described in the case.
* Non-Hodgkins lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including fevers, night sweats, chills, arthralgias, and weight loss. However, the patient in the case does not have any of these symptoms, and cross-sectional imaging shows no evidence of lymphadenopathy.

 95%|█████████▍| 1444/1525 [5:52:29<20:17, 15.03s/it]The correct answer is C. Catheterization of left anomalous pulmonary vein.

The patient in this case had a history of aortic valve endocarditis and prosthetic valve replacement. He also had chronic renal failure requiring dialysis via tunneled catheter. On this admission, he was found to have MRSA bacteremia. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a vegetation on his prosthetic aortic valve. He was diagnosed as having MRSA prosthetic valve endocarditis and admitted to the cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit prior to surgical intervention.

In the setting of MRSA bacteremia, his tunneled dialysis catheter had been removed. Owing to his dialysis needs, a temporary dialysis catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. As intravenous access was required for vasoactive medications and intravenous antibiotics, a triple-lumen central catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein under ultrasonographic guidance. The catheter went in easily without resistance, was drop tested to confirm venous placement, and flushed and drew easily, and venous waveforms and pressures were transduced. However, on postprocedure radiography, the tip of the triple-lumen catheter was not in the expected location (Figure 1). The catheter was removed, and a new-stick insertion of a new catheter was attempted under ultrasonographic guidance.

Chest radiograph showing left internal jugular catheter placement (arrowhead).

The most likely explanation for the unexpected location of the catheter tip is that it had entered the left anomalous pulmonary vein. This is a rare congenital anomaly in which one of the pulmonary veins drains directly into the left atrium instead of the left superior vena cava. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 10,000 people.

The left anomalous pulmonary vein is usually located posterior to the left pulmonary artery and anterior to the left subclavian artery. It is typically a thin-walled vein that is easily catheterized. However, if it is not recognized, it can lead to serious complications, such as pulmonary embolism, infection, and cardiac arrhythmias.

In this case, the patient's history of aortic valve endocarditis and prosthetic valve replacement made him at increased risk for developing an anomalous pulmonary vein. The fact that the catheter went in easily without resistance, was drop tested to confirm venous placement, and flushed and drew easily, and venous waveforms and pressures were transduced all suggested that the catheter was in the correct location. However, the postprocedure radiograph showed that the tip of the catheter was not in the expected location. This suggests that the catheter had entered the left anomalous pulmonary vein.

The correct treatment for a catheterized left anomalous pulmonary vein is to remove the catheter and place a new catheter in the correct location. In this case, the patient's catheter was removed and a new catheter was placed in the left subclavian vein. The patient was then discharged from the hospital without further complications.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Catheterization of left pericardiacophrenic vein: The pericardiacophrenic veins are small veins that drain the pericardium and diaphragm. They are located anterior to the left lung and posterior to the left atrium. It is very unlikely that a catheter would enter these veins during a central venous catheter placement.

B. Catheterization of left internal thoracic vein: The internal thoracic veins are large veins that drain the chest wall. They are located anterior to the left lung and posterior to the left atrium. It is very unlikely that a catheter would enter these veins during a central venous catheter placement.

D. Catheterization of left superior intercostal vein: The superior intercostal veins are small veins that drain the upper chest wall. They are located anterior to the left lung and posterior to the left atrium. It is very unlikely that a catheter would enter these veins during a central venous catheter placement.

The patient has erythema multiforme, a skin condition that is often caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with erythema multiforme, and the biopsy findings are also consistent with the diagnosis.

The patient's treatment should include both oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy. Oral prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps to reduce inflammation. HSV viral suppression therapy helps to prevent the recurrence of HSV infections.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Check serum cryoglobulin level: Cryoglobulins are proteins that form in the blood when it is cooled. They can be associated with a number of diseases, including erythema multiforme. However, there is no evidence that checking serum cryoglobulin levels would be helpful in this case.
* Administer intradermal progesterone challenge: Intradermal progesterone challenge is a test that is used to diagnose autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. This condition is not associated with erythema multiforme.
* Prescribe interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir: Interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir are medications that are used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The patient has a history of HCV infection, but she is not currently being treated for the infection. There is no evidence that these medications would be helpful in treating her erythema multiforme.

 95%|█████████▍| 1446/1525 [5:52:58<18:58, 14.41s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination.

The patient presents with a painless plaque on the right side of his scrotum that has been slowly enlarging for 1.5 years. The plaque is bright reddish, irregularly shaped, measures 4.0 × 1.5 cm, and has erosions on the surface. The patient reports no fevers or chills. On examination, the physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. Results of complete blood cell count and differential are normal.

A topical steroid would not be the best initial treatment for this lesion because it is not clear what the etiology of the lesion is. A biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis and would be the most appropriate next step in management.

Initiating treatment with valacyclovir without a definitive diagnosis is not recommended. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat genital herpes. The patient does not report any symptoms of genital herpes, and the lesion does not have the classic appearance of genital herpes. In addition, the patient's complete blood cell count and differential are normal, which makes genital herpes less likely.

Ordering laboratory studies to rule out syphilis is also not recommended. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions. However, the patient does not report any risk factors for syphilis, and the lesion does not have the classic appearance of syphilis. In addition, the patient's complete blood cell count and differential are normal, which makes syphilis less likely.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and will guide further management.

 95%|█████████▍| 1447/1525 [5:53:14<19:28, 14.97s/it]The correct answer is C. Primary aldosteronism is suggested; confirmation requires an aldosterone suppression test.

The patient's blood pressure is 183/116 mm Hg despite taking lisinopril (40 mg/d) and verapamil (180 mg/d). This suggests that he may have secondary hypertension, which is a type of high blood pressure that is caused by an underlying medical condition. One possible cause of secondary hypertension is primary aldosteronism, which is a condition in which the adrenal glands produce too much of the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water, which can lead to high blood pressure.

To test for primary aldosteronism, a doctor would measure the patient's plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA). PAC is a measure of the amount of aldosterone in the blood, and PRA is a measure of the activity of the renin enzyme. Renin is an enzyme that helps to regulate blood pressure by stimulating the production of aldosterone.

In a patient with primary aldosteronism, the PAC would be high and the PRA would be low. This is because the high level of aldosterone in the blood suppresses the production of renin. In the case of the patient in the question, the PAC is 25 ng/dL and the PRA is 0.2 ng/mL/h. This suggests that he may have primary aldosteronism.

However, the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism cannot be made based on the PAC and PRA alone. Additional testing is required, such as an aldosterone suppression test. In this test, the patient is given a dose of a drug that suppresses the production of aldosterone. If the PAC does not decrease after the test, it is a strong indication of primary aldosteronism.

In the case of the patient in the question, he would need to have an aldosterone suppression test to confirm the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. If the test is positive, he would need to be treated for the condition. Treatment options include surgery to remove the affected adrenal gland or medication to reduce the production of aldosterone.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not provide a complete explanation of the patient's condition.

* Option A is incorrect because it states that primary aldosteronism is confirmed. However, the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism cannot be made based on the PAC and PRA alone. Additional testing is required, such as an aldosterone suppression test.
* Option B is incorrect because it states that imaging is required for confirmation. While imaging may be helpful in diagnosing primary aldosteronism, it is not necessary. The diagnosis can be made based on the PAC and PRA, as well as an aldosterone suppression test.
* Option D is incorrect because it states that the results are unreliable. However, the results of the PAC and PRA are reliable in diagnosing primary aldosteronism. The only way to be sure of the diagnosis is to perform an aldosterone suppression test.

FA is a diagnostic test that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It is used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.

In this case, the patient is experiencing transient blurred vision. This could be caused by a number of conditions, including retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. FA can help to diagnose the underlying cause of the blurred vision and determine the best course of treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the best tests to diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's blurred vision.

* Screen for autoantibodies: This test is used to detect the presence of antibodies in the blood. Autoantibodies are proteins that the body's immune system produces in response to its own tissues. This test is not specific for any particular eye condition and would not be helpful in diagnosing the patient's blurred vision.
* Repeat lumbar puncture: This procedure involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This test is used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis. It would not be helpful in diagnosing the patient's blurred vision.
* Carotid ultrasonography: This test uses sound waves to create images of the carotid arteries, which are the major arteries that supply blood to the brain. This test is used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including carotid artery stenosis, carotid artery dissection, and stroke. It would not be helpful in diagnosing the patient's blurred vision.

She now presents with a 5-day history of photopsias and blurry vision in the left eye, as well as decreased peripheral vision and pain on eye movements of the left eye. She also had a recent episode of gastroenteritis prior to the onset of visual complaints.

The patient's symptoms are concerning for optic neuritis, which is a common complication of MS. However, the patient's history of gastroenteritis raises the possibility of another diagnosis, such as Bartonella henselae infection. Bartonella henselae is a bacterium that can cause cat-scratch disease, which can sometimes lead to optic neuritis.

In order to rule out other possible causes of the patient's visual symptoms, it is important to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. MRI is a highly sensitive test that can detect changes in the brain and optic nerves that may not be visible on a physical examination.

If the MRI shows no evidence of MS or other causes of optic neuritis, then the patient may be diagnosed with Bartonella henselae infection. Bartonella henselae infection is usually treated with antibiotics.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, "Observe the patient," is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious condition that requires further evaluation.
* Option B, "Start steroid therapy," is incorrect because the patient does not have MS, and steroid therapy is not indicated for the treatment of optic neuritis in patients with MS.
* Option D, "Order serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae," is incorrect because this test is not necessary if the patient has already been diagnosed with Bartonella henselae infection.

 95%|█████████▌| 1450/1525 [5:53:56<18:20, 14.68s/it]Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This is a non-infectious inflammatory condition of the orbit, which is the bony cavity that contains the eye, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels that control eye movement. IOIS is characterized by inflammation of the orbital tissues, which can lead to swelling, pain, redness, and proptosis (bulging of the eye). The cause of IOIS is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The patient in this case presents with several features that are consistent with IOIS. He has a history of recurrent episodes of orbital inflammation, which is a common feature of IOIS. He also has signs of inflammation on physical examination, including eyelid swelling, redness, and chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and the white of the eye). Imaging studies show inflammation of the orbital tissues, which is another characteristic finding of IOIS.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are orbital cellulitis, rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles, and thyroid ophthalmopathy. Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the orbital tissues, which is characterized by fever, redness, swelling, and pain. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the extraocular muscles. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is a condition that occurs in people with hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), and is characterized by inflammation of the orbital tissues.

The patient in this case does not have any features that are consistent with orbital cellulitis, such as fever or systemic symptoms. He also does not have any features that are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma, such as a mass on imaging studies. The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with IOIS, and the imaging studies show inflammation of the orbital tissues. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is IOIS.

 95%|█████████▌| 1451/1525 [5:54:12<18:48, 15.25s/it]The correct answer is D: Appendiceal intussusception.

Appendiceal intussusception is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, telescopes into itself. This can cause blockage of the appendix and inflammation.

The symptoms of appendicitis can vary depending on the severity of the condition. However, common symptoms include:

* Lower abdominal pain, often described as a sharp pain that comes and goes
* Nausea and vomiting
* Fever
* Loss of appetite
* Constipation or diarrhea

Appendiceal intussusception is most common in children under the age of 10, but it can also occur in adults. The exact cause of appendicitis is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a blockage of the appendix, which can be caused by a foreign object, infection, or tumor.

Appendiceal intussusception is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the appendix.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms or the findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

* Answer choice A: Appendiceal abscess is a collection of pus that forms around the appendix. It is a complication of appendicitis that can occur if the appendix ruptures. The patient's symptoms and the findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies do not suggest that she has an appendiceal abscess.
* Answer choice B: Ileal intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the small intestine telescopes into itself. It is most common in children under the age of 2. The patient's symptoms and the findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies do not suggest that she has ileal intussusception.
* Answer choice C: Cecal volvulus is a condition in which the cecum, the lower part of the large intestine, twists on itself. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. The patient's symptoms and the findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies do not suggest that she has cecal volvulus.

 95%|█████████▌| 1452/1525 [5:54:23<16:56, 13.93s/it]The correct answer is D. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor.

Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor (PSFMT) is a rare, soft tissue neoplasm that is often misdiagnosed as sarcoma. It typically occurs in adults, with a median age of 40 years. The most common site of involvement is the thigh, followed by the arm and trunk. PSFMT is a locally aggressive tumor that can recur after surgery. However, it rarely metastasizes.

The diagnosis of PSFMT is made on the basis of histopathologic examination. PSFMT is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells in a myxoid stroma. The cells are often arranged in fascicles or storiform patterns. Foci of necrosis and hemorrhage are often present. Immunohistochemical staining is helpful in confirming the diagnosis. PSFMT is typically positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and desmin. It is negative for CD34 and CDK4.

The treatment of PSFMT is surgical excision. Radiation therapy may be used in cases of high-grade tumors or those that are incompletely excised. Chemotherapy is not routinely used. The prognosis for PSFMT is generally good. With complete surgical excision, the recurrence rate is low. However, local recurrence can occur, and distant metastasis is rare.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Recurrent prostatic carcinoma is incorrect because the patient has a history of neurofibromatosis 1, which is a risk factor for PSFMT.
* Neurofibroma is incorrect because the patient has a history of prostatic carcinoma, which is not a risk factor for neurofibroma.
* Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is incorrect because the patient has a history of prostatic carcinoma, which is not a risk factor for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

 95%|█████████▌| 1453/1525 [5:54:39<17:28, 14.56s/it]The correct answer is B. Fungal mycetoma.

A malignant sarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the bones or soft tissues. It is not the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms of cancer, such as weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats. Additionally, the CT scan shows that the mass is not invading the liver, which is a common finding in malignant sarcomas.

A giant infiltrating lipoma is a type of benign (noncancerous) tumor that starts in the fat cells. It is not the most likely diagnosis in this case because the mass is growing rapidly and causing pain. Additionally, the CT scan shows that the mass is invading the liver, which is not a common finding in giant infiltrating lipomas.

A bacterial abscess is a collection of pus that forms when bacteria infect an area of the body. It is not the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms of infection, such as fever or chills. Additionally, the CT scan shows that the mass is not surrounded by inflammation, which is a common finding in bacterial abscesses.

Fungal mycetoma is a chronic infection of the skin and soft tissues that is caused by fungi. It is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the patient has a history of exposure to fungi (he lives in a rural area) and the mass is growing rapidly and causing pain. Additionally, the CT scan shows that the mass is invading the liver, which is a common finding in fungal mycetoma.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Fungal mycetoma.

 95%|█████████▌| 1454/1525 [5:54:55<17:51, 15.09s/it]The correct answer is D. This patient is infected with the most common strain of HCV in the United States and it has lower response rates to interferon-based therapy.

The patient's hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) result was positive, indicating that she has been infected with HCV at some point in her life. The patient's additional tests performed to evaluate the extent of liver disease were unremarkable, meaning that there is no evidence of significant liver damage. However, the patient's age and history of being born between 1945 and 1965 place her at increased risk for infection with the most common strain of HCV in the United States, which is genotype 1. Genotype 1 HCV has lower response rates to interferon-based therapy than other genotypes of HCV.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. This patient has a low viral load. The patient's viral load was not reported, so it is not possible to determine whether she has a low or high viral load.
* B. This patient has antibody to HCV and is no longer infected. The patient's antibody to HCV result was positive, indicating that she has been infected with HCV at some point in her life. However, the patient's additional tests performed to evaluate the extent of liver disease were unremarkable, meaning that there is no evidence of significant liver damage. This suggests that the patient is still infected with HCV.
* C. This patient has no liver damage because her aminotransferase levels are not elevated. The patient's aminotransferase levels were not elevated, but this does not mean that she has no liver damage. There are other tests that can be used to assess liver damage, such as liver biopsy.

 95%|█████████▌| 1455/1525 [5:55:03<14:49, 12.71s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl with a history of intermittent left shoulder and left-sided chest pain for 4 months following a dance recital. She has been treated with analgesia and physiotherapy. She denies fever, cough, orthopnea, weight loss, and appetite change. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the location of the left fifth rib and reduced left chest expansion. There is no chest wall deformity. Chest radiography (Figure 1) shows left lower lobe opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic angle.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and malignancy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is the most appropriate test to further evaluate this patient. A CT scan can provide information about the size, location, and shape of the opacification, as well as the presence of any other abnormalities, such as consolidation, atelectasis, or pleural effusion. This information can help to narrow the differential diagnosis and guide further management.

A bronchoscopy is not necessary in this patient because the history, physical examination, and chest radiograph are not consistent with a foreign body aspiration. A complete blood cell count, blood culture, sputum culture, and purified protein derivative test are not necessary in this patient because the history, physical examination, and chest radiograph are not consistent with pneumonia or tuberculosis. Treatment with oral antibiotics is not necessary in this patient because the history, physical examination, and chest radiograph are not consistent with an infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest.

 95%|█████████▌| 1456/1525 [5:55:16<14:57, 13.00s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform a punch biopsy of the lesion.

The patient is a 25-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presents with a hyperpigmented lesion on the shin. The lesion has been present for 3 years and has gradually increased in size. It is now 3 cm in diameter and is sclerotic, reddish brown, and has central yellow deposits. The patient denies systemic symptoms, including fevers and chills.

The most likely diagnosis is necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD). NLD is a chronic, non-inflammatory skin condition that is associated with diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by the formation of atrophic, sclerotic, reddish brown plaques on the shins. The lesions are often tender and may have central yellow deposits.

The diagnosis of NLD is made clinically. A biopsy is not always necessary, but it may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes, such as granuloma annulare or sarcoidosis.

The treatment of NLD is aimed at controlling the underlying diabetes mellitus and relieving the symptoms of the lesions. Topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors may be helpful. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Obtain a radiograph of the lower leg. A radiograph of the lower leg is not necessary in the diagnosis of NLD. The lesions are typically not associated with bone involvement.

B. Obtain antinuclear antibody levels. Antinuclear antibody levels are not necessary in the diagnosis of NLD. NLD is not an autoimmune disease.

D. Obtain blood cultures and prescribe empirical antibiotics. Obtaining blood cultures and prescribing empirical antibiotics is not necessary in the diagnosis of NLD. NLD is not an infectious disease.

 96%|█████████▌| 1457/1525 [5:55:29<14:45, 13.02s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain a surgical consultation for splenectomy.

The patient is a 72-year-old man with a 23-year history of polycythemia vera. He presents with a 2-week history of left upper quadrant pain. Three years earlier, red cell scintigraphy documented a splenic hemangioma, which remained stable on periodic computed tomography (CT) scans. There is no history of abdominal trauma, melena, or hematochezia. The patient had lost 6.75 kg (15 lb) and experienced increasing fatigue during a period of 1 month. On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The spleen edge is palpable 6 cm below the left costal margin (increased from 1 month prior). There is no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. On rectal examination there is no gross blood, and no stool to perform a guaiac test. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL (from 12 g/dL 2 months earlier and 8 g/dL 1 week earlier), white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.76 × 109/L, and platelet count of 266 × 109/L. A CT scan of the abdomen was performed, which showed a large splenic hemangioma with evidence of hemorrhage.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a ruptured splenic hemangioma. Splenic hemangiomas are the most common type of benign tumor of the spleen, and they are found in approximately 5% of the population. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can bleed if they rupture. The risk of rupture is increased in patients with polycythemia vera, as in this case.

The management of a ruptured splenic hemangioma depends on the patient's clinical status. In patients who are hemodynamically stable, initial management is with supportive care, including blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation. If the patient is unstable, surgery is indicated to control bleeding and remove the spleen.

In this case, the patient is hemodynamically stable, so initial management is with supportive care. However, the patient has a large splenic hemangioma with evidence of hemorrhage, so surgery is indicated to control bleeding and remove the spleen. A surgical consultation should be obtained to discuss the risks and benefits of splenectomy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option A (manage conservatively with transfusions, fluids, and analgesics) would not be effective in controlling bleeding from a ruptured splenic hemangioma. Option B (obtain a bone marrow biopsy) would not be helpful in this case, as the patient has a known diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Option C (obtain an urgent upper endoscopy) would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a gastrointestinal bleed.

 96%|█████████▌| 1458/1525 [5:55:42<14:23, 12.89s/it]The correct answer is B. Place bandage contact lenses.

The patient has a neurotrophic corneal ulcer, which is a type of corneal ulcer that occurs due to a loss of corneal sensation. This can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes, contact lens wear, and certain medications. Without treatment, a neurotrophic corneal ulcer can lead to corneal perforation and vision loss.

Bandage contact lenses are a type of contact lens that is used to protect the cornea and promote healing. They are made of a soft, flexible material that conforms to the shape of the cornea. Bandage contact lenses can also help to reduce pain and inflammation.

In this case, the patient has a history of contact lens wear and diabetes. He also has decreased corneal sensation, which makes him at risk for developing a neurotrophic corneal ulcer. The patient's symptoms, including blurry vision, redness, and a corneal epithelial defect, are consistent with a neurotrophic corneal ulcer.

The first step in treating a neurotrophic corneal ulcer is to place a bandage contact lens. This will help to protect the cornea and promote healing. The patient should also be given topical antibiotics to prevent infection. In some cases, oral steroids may also be necessary.

The patient should be monitored closely for signs of improvement. If the ulcer does not heal with treatment, surgery may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Prescribe oral prednisone. Oral steroids are not the first-line treatment for a neurotrophic corneal ulcer. They can be used to reduce inflammation, but they can also slow down the healing process.
* Option C: Perform tarsorrhaphy. Tarsorrhaphy is a surgical procedure that involves stitching the eyelids together. This can be used to protect the cornea from further damage, but it is not a necessary treatment for a neurotrophic corneal ulcer.
* Option D: Prescribe lubrication with autologous serum tears. Autologous serum tears are a type of eye drop that is made from the patient's own blood. They can be helpful in treating dry eyes, but they are not effective in treating a neurotrophic corneal ulcer.

 96%|█████████▌| 1459/1525 [5:55:50<12:39, 11.50s/it]The correct answer is D. Surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis.

The patient is a 22-year-old man with a history of a moving black spot in his right eye for 1 year. The lesion is oval in shape, measures 2 mm in thickness by 2 mm in diameter, is translucent and brown, and changes its location with head posture. These findings are consistent with a dermoid cyst.

A dermoid cyst is a congenital lesion that is thought to arise from abnormal development of the ectoderm. It is typically located in the anterior chamber of the eye, but can also occur in the iris, ciliary body, or choroid. Dermoid cysts are usually benign, but can rarely become malignant.

The treatment for a dermoid cyst is surgical removal. This can be performed with a small incision in the cornea or sclera. The cyst is then removed and the incision is closed with sutures.

A computerized tomographic scan (CT scan) is not necessary to diagnose a dermoid cyst. A CT scan can be used to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor or infection. However, a CT scan is not necessary to diagnose a dermoid cyst and would not change the management of the patient.

Anterior segment tomography with Pentacam is a type of imaging test that can be used to evaluate the structure of the anterior chamber of the eye. This test can be used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts. However, anterior segment tomography with Pentacam is not necessary to diagnose a dermoid cyst and would not change the management of the patient.

Begin systemic treatment with albendazole is not a recommended treatment for a dermoid cyst. Albendazole is an antiparasitic medication that is used to treat a variety of parasitic infections, including echinococcosis. Echinococcosis is a parasitic infection that is caused by tapeworms. The tapeworm larvae can encyst in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. Albendazole is effective in treating echinococcosis, but it is not effective in treating dermoid cysts.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis. The patient has a dermoid cyst, which is a congenital lesion that is typically located in the anterior chamber of the eye. Dermoid cysts are usually benign, but can rarely become malignant. The treatment for a dermoid cyst is surgical removal.

 96%|█████████▌| 1460/1525 [5:56:07<14:02, 12.97s/it]The correct answer is C. Lyme disease. The patient's history of a recent tick bite, the presence of an annular rash, and the patient's location in a heavily wooded area are all consistent with a diagnosis of Lyme disease.

Fixed drug eruption is a type of skin rash that occurs after taking certain medications. The rash is typically red, raised, and itchy, and it can appear anywhere on the body. In this case, the patient does not have a history of taking any medications that could cause a fixed drug eruption.

Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the skin. The rash is typically ring-shaped, with a clear center and a raised, red border. It can appear anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the trunk and extremities. In this case, the patient's rash is not ring-shaped, and it does not have a clear center or a raised, red border.

Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition that causes small, raised, red bumps on the skin. The bumps are typically round or oval, and they can appear anywhere on the body. In this case, the patient's rash does not match the typical presentation of granuloma annulare.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease. The patient should be treated with antibiotics to prevent the infection from spreading.

 96%|█████████▌| 1461/1525 [5:56:20<13:52, 13.00s/it]The correct diagnosis is angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia (ALNH). ALNH is a benign condition characterized by the proliferation of small blood vessels and lymph follicles in lymph nodes. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and older adults, and is more common in men than women. The cause of ALNH is unknown, but it is thought to be a reactive process that may be triggered by infection, inflammation, or autoimmune disease.

The clinical presentation of ALNH is variable, and some patients may be asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they may include abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. ALNH is often diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons.

The diagnosis of ALNH is made based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen. ALNH is typically treated with observation or steroids. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected lymph nodes.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and other organs. Carcinoid tumors are often slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until they have spread to other parts of the body. The symptoms of carcinoid tumors can vary depending on the location of the tumor, but may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, and wheezing. Carcinoid tumors are typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
* Desmoid tumor is a rare type of soft tissue tumor that can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the abdomen. Desmoid tumors are typically slow-growing and are not usually cancerous. However, they can grow locally and can cause pain, disfigurement, and obstruction of organs. Desmoid tumors are typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a type of mesenchymal tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs are typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until they have spread to other parts of the body. The symptoms of GISTs can vary depending on the location of the tumor, but may include abdominal pain, weight loss, and bleeding. GISTs are typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

A uterine fibroid is a noncancerous growth that develops in the uterus. Fibroids are very common, affecting up to 80% of women by age 50. Most fibroids are small and cause no symptoms. However, large fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility.

An avulsed uterine fibroid is a fibroid that has become detached from the wall of the uterus. This can happen as a result of trauma, such as a motor vehicle accident. When a fibroid is avulsed, it can cause bleeding and pain. In some cases, an avulsed fibroid can also cause infection.

The patient in the case presented with diffuse lower abdominal pain with nausea and one episode of emesis. Her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 108/69 mm Hg and a heart rate of 124 beats/min. Physical examination findings revealed tachycardia and a distended, diffusely tender abdomen without evidence of a seatbelt sign or peritonitis. Her laboratory findings were unremarkable except for a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 21 300/μL. Her medical history was significant only for asthma.

Computed tomography revealed a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis with an area of focal density consistent with a hematoma in the left midabdomen that measured 7.3 × 6.1 × 7.5 cm. There was also an area of free fluid in the right lower quadrant with irregularity of the right gonadal vein and a heterogeneous and bulky uterus.

The diagnosis of avulsed uterine fibroid is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The computed tomography findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of avulsed uterine fibroid.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on computed tomography.

Duodenal injury is a rare but serious complication of blunt abdominal trauma. It is usually caused by a direct blow to the abdomen, such as in a motor vehicle accident. Duodenal injuries can cause bleeding, infection, and perforation of the duodenum.

Mesenteric hematoma is a collection of blood in the mesentery, which is the tissue that attaches the small intestine to the back of the abdominal wall. Mesenteric hematomas can be caused by blunt abdominal trauma, such as in a motor vehicle accident, or by a tear in a blood vessel in the mesentery.

Right gonadal vein injury is a rare but serious complication of blunt abdominal trauma. It is usually caused by a direct blow to the abdomen, such as in a motor vehicle accident. Right gonadal vein injuries can cause bleeding, infection, and testicular atrophy.

Ileocolic intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the small intestine telescopes into the next portion of the small intestine. This can cause a blockage of the intestine and can lead to serious complications if not treated.

The most common symptoms of ileocolic intussusception are abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. In some cases, the patient may also pass blood in their stool.

The diagnosis of ileocolic intussusception is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as abdominal X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

The treatment for ileocolic intussusception is surgery. The surgeon will remove the intussusception and any other abnormalities that may be present.

The prognosis for ileocolic intussusception is generally good. Most patients make a full recovery after surgery.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

 96%|█████████▌| 1464/1525 [5:57:06<14:27, 14.22s/it]The correct answer is C. Order observation and cardiac monitoring. The patient has severe lactic acidosis, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including sepsis, shock, and intoxication. The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for any one of these conditions, so it is important to observe the patient closely and monitor his cardiac status. Imaging of the left leg is not necessary at this time, as it is not likely to provide any additional information. Intravenous antibiotics should only be administered if the patient is found to have sepsis. An extended drug screen is not necessary, as the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of drug intoxication.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* **A. Obtain imaging of the left leg.** This is not the correct answer because imaging of the left leg is not necessary at this time. The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for any one of the conditions that could cause leg pain, such as a fracture, infection, or compartment syndrome. Imaging of the left leg could be considered if the patient's symptoms do not improve with observation or if the patient develops new symptoms.
* **B. Order intravenous antibiotics.** This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection. Intravenous antibiotics should only be administered if the patient is found to have sepsis. Sepsis is a serious infection that can lead to organ failure and death. The diagnosis of sepsis is based on a combination of clinical findings, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and laboratory findings, such as an elevated white blood cell count.
* **C. Order observation and cardiac monitoring.** This is the correct answer because the patient has severe lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is a condition in which the body produces too much lactic acid. Lactic acid is a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down glucose for energy. When the body produces too much lactic acid, the pH of the blood can drop, which can lead to a number of serious complications, including coma and death. The patient should be observed closely and monitored for signs of complications. Cardiac monitoring is important because lactic acidosis can cause arrhythmias, which are abnormal heart rhythms.
* **D. Perform an extended drug screen.** This is not the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of drug intoxication. An extended drug screen is a test that can detect a variety of drugs in the blood or urine. The test is typically ordered when a patient is suspected of drug intoxication or drug abuse. The patient in this case does not have any signs or symptoms of drug intoxication, so an extended drug screen is not necessary.

 96%|█████████▌| 1465/1525 [5:57:21<14:28, 14.47s/it]The correct answer is A. The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic.

The patient's symptoms of paroxysmal tachycardia, oxygen desaturation, diminished breath sounds in bibasilar lung fields, and pulmonary edema on chest x-ray are all consistent with congestive heart failure. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is also a risk factor for congestive heart failure.

A loop diuretic, such as furosemide, is the first-line treatment for congestive heart failure. Loop diuretics work by increasing the excretion of sodium and water, which helps to reduce the volume of fluid in the body and improve symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Option B is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient has pulmonary artery hypertension. Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient has a pulmonary embolus. Option D is incorrect because the patient's anemia is not symptomatic and does not require transfusion.

 96%|█████████▌| 1466/1525 [5:57:31<13:00, 13.22s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform excisional biopsy.

The patient has a firm, large fungating mass with overlying pigment changes and tortuous feeding vessels. This is highly suggestive of a malignant melanoma of the uvea. The most appropriate management for this condition is excisional biopsy with histopathologic examination to confirm the diagnosis and determine the stage of the disease. Topical interferon drops are not indicated for the management of malignant melanoma of the uvea. They have not been shown to be effective in treating this condition and may actually increase the risk of metastasis. Enucleation is a surgical procedure to remove the entire eye. It is only indicated for patients with malignant melanoma of the uvea that has spread to the optic nerve or the orbit. In this patient, the mass is confined to the uvea and there is no evidence of metastasis. Therefore, enucleation is not necessary.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* **A. Prescribe topical interferon drops:** Topical interferon drops are not indicated for the management of malignant melanoma of the uvea. They have not been shown to be effective in treating this condition and may actually increase the risk of metastasis.
* **B. Prescribe topical interferon drops followed by excisional biopsy:** This is not the best approach. Topical interferon drops should not be used to treat malignant melanoma of the uvea. Excision biopsy is the most appropriate management for this condition.
* **C. Perform excisional biopsy:** Excision biopsy is the most appropriate management for malignant melanoma of the uvea. It allows for confirmation of the diagnosis and determination of the stage of the disease.
* **D. Recommend enucleation:** Enucleation is only indicated for patients with malignant melanoma of the uvea that has spread to the optic nerve or the orbit. In this patient, the mass is confined to the uvea and there is no evidence of metastasis. Therefore, enucleation is not necessary.

 96%|█████████▌| 1467/1525 [5:57:45<13:01, 13.47s/it]The correct answer is A. Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia).

A white pupil, or leukocoria, is a common finding in children. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including retinoblastoma, cataracts, and uveitis. In order to determine the cause of the leukocoria, a funduscopic examination must be performed. A funduscopic examination is a procedure in which the doctor uses an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to look at the inside of the eye. The ophthalmoscope has a light and a lens that allow the doctor to see the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

In a child who is unable to cooperate with a funduscopic examination, general anesthesia may be necessary. General anesthesia is a type of medication that puts the child to sleep so that they will not be aware of the procedure. Once the child is asleep, the doctor will be able to perform the funduscopic examination without any difficulty.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Reassure parents and follow up in 3 months: This is not the correct answer because the cause of the leukocoria needs to be determined as soon as possible. A delay in diagnosis and treatment could lead to serious vision loss or even blindness.
* Obtain serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis: This is a blood test that can be used to detect Toxocara canis, a parasite that can cause eye infections in children. However, this test is not always accurate and it is not the first test that should be ordered in a child with leukocoria.
* Start urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis: This is a treatment for uveitis, an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. However, uveitis is not the most common cause of leukocoria in children. In addition, starting anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy without first determining the cause of the leukocoria could make the condition worse.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia).

 96%|█████████▋| 1468/1525 [5:57:56<11:57, 12.59s/it]The correct answer is C. Further laboratory and imaging studies.

The patient has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes. The patient has already been treated with prednisone, which is a corticosteroid that is used to reduce inflammation. However, the patient's vision has continued to worsen. This suggests that the patient's sarcoidosis is not responding to treatment.

In order to determine the best course of treatment, it is important to further evaluate the patient's condition. This may include additional laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray and a CT scan of the chest, may also be helpful in evaluating the extent of the patient's disease.

Once the patient's condition has been further evaluated, the treating physician can determine the best course of treatment. This may include adding an immunomodulatory agent, such as azathioprine or methotrexate, to the patient's treatment regimen. In some cases, the patient may also need to undergo surgery to remove inflamed tissue.

It is important to note that there is no cure for sarcoidosis. However, with appropriate treatment, the patient's symptoms can be controlled and their vision can be preserved.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Increasing the dose of prednisone is not the best course of action at this time. The patient has already been treated with prednisone, and their vision has continued to worsen. This suggests that the patient's sarcoidosis is not responding to treatment. Increasing the dose of prednisone may not be effective in controlling the patient's symptoms.
* Option B: Adding an immunomodulatory agent is a possible course of treatment, but it is important to first further evaluate the patient's condition. This may include additional laboratory tests and imaging studies. Once the patient's condition has been further evaluated, the treating physician can determine if an immunomodulatory agent is the best course of treatment.
* Option D: Urgent immunology consultation for treatment of steroid-resistant sarcoidosis is not necessary at this time. The patient has not yet been diagnosed with steroid-resistant sarcoidosis. The patient's vision has continued to worsen, but this does not necessarily mean that the patient's sarcoidosis is steroid-resistant. Further evaluation is necessary before making a diagnosis of steroid-resistant sarcoidosis.

 96%|█████████▋| 1469/1525 [5:58:12<12:53, 13.81s/it]The correct answer is A. Ultrasonography or MRI allowing for characterization of the lesion and its extent.

The lesion in question is a yellow-orange, rough nodule on the medial right thigh of an 8-year-old boy. It has evolved from a flat discoloration since the age of 3 years, and has continued to slowly enlarge and thicken. The patient denies spontaneous bleeding or ulceration, and he has full range of motion and use of his extremity. Neither he nor his family members report a history of similar lesions on their body. He does not take any medications, has never been hospitalized, and has never had any major surgical procedures. His upper and lower extremities are otherwise normal. On inspection, there is a 4.5 cm × 3.5 cm, verrucous plaque with underlying fullness on the right medial thigh. There are also punctate vessels evident on the hyperkeratotic surface.

The differential diagnosis for this lesion includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratosis, verruca vulgaris, condyloma acuminatum, dermatofibroma, and squamous cell carcinoma. In order to narrow the differential diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment, it is necessary to characterize the lesion and its extent. This can be done with either ultrasonography or MRI.

Ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses sound waves to create images of the body's internal structures. It is a safe and effective way to evaluate soft tissue lesions, such as the one in question. Ultrasonography can provide information about the size, shape, and location of the lesion, as well as its internal architecture. This information can be helpful in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions.

MRI is another non-invasive imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the body's internal structures. MRI is more sensitive than ultrasonography, and it can provide more detailed images of soft tissue lesions. MRI can also be used to evaluate the bone and muscle structures around the lesion. This information can be helpful in planning the surgical approach to the lesion.

In this case, ultrasonography or MRI would be the best way to characterize the lesion and its extent. This information would then be used to determine the appropriate course of treatment. If the lesion is determined to be benign, it may be monitored or treated with topical therapy. If the lesion is determined to be malignant, it will need to be surgically removed.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide enough information to make a diagnosis or determine the appropriate course of treatment. Option B, shave biopsy, would only provide information about the superficial part of the lesion. This information would not be enough to make a diagnosis or determine the appropriate course of treatment. Option C, immediate excision, would be a premature and potentially unnecessary intervention. Option D, no treatment or diagnostic tests are necessary at this time, is also incorrect. The lesion needs to be evaluated and characterized before a decision can be made about whether or not treatment is necessary.

 96%|█████████▋| 1470/1525 [5:58:29<13:20, 14.56s/it]The correct answer is C. Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis.

The patient had a history of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation 15 years ago and both grafts had been functioning well. Two days prior to presentation, he had a peripheral angiogram done to evaluate a nonhealing left foot ulcer by an interventional cardiologist, at which time a stent graft was deployed to the right common iliac artery for a pseudoaneurysm that was incidentally discovered. On examination, he was in no distress, had a temperature of 37° C, and blood pressure of 91/44 mm Hg. Two days after presentation, a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained (Figure). It showed an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery.

A stent can be seen in the right common iliac artery (A and C, arrowheads). A gas-containing phlegmon was also evident (B and C, asterisks).

The most likely diagnosis is iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis. This is a rare but serious complication of pancreas transplantation. It can occur as a result of technical problems during the transplantation procedure, or it can develop later as a result of infection, inflammation, or rejection of the transplanted pancreas.

The symptoms of iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis can vary depending on the extent of the thrombosis. In some cases, the patient may experience no symptoms at all. In other cases, the patient may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss. If the thrombosis is extensive, the patient may develop kidney failure, pancreatitis, or sepsis.

The diagnosis of iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as a computed tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

The treatment of iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis depends on the extent of the thrombosis and the patient's symptoms. In some cases, the patient may be treated with anticoagulation therapy. In other cases, the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove the clot and restore blood flow to the pancreas.

The prognosis for patients with iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis varies depending on the extent of the thrombosis and the patient's overall health. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients make a good recovery. However, in some cases, the thrombosis can be fatal.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Ruptured acute appendicitis is unlikely in this patient because he does not have any of the classic symptoms of appendicitis, such as right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.
* Cecal inflammation with abscess is also unlikely in this patient because he does not have any of the classic symptoms of cecal inflammation, such as right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.
* Hematoma is unlikely in this patient because the computed tomographic scan shows an air-containing abscess, which is not a typical finding in a hematoma.

 96%|█████████▋| 1471/1525 [5:58:39<11:52, 13.20s/it]The correct answer is D. Appendiceal intussusception.

Appendiceal intussusception is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, telescopes into itself. This can cause blockage of the appendix and lead to inflammation, infection, and even rupture.

The most common symptom of appendiceal intussusception is right lower quadrant pain. This pain may be sudden and severe, or it may come and go. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever, and loss of appetite.

Appendiceal intussusception is most common in children, but it can occur in adults as well. It is more common in people with a history of appendicitis or other abdominal conditions.

The diagnosis of appendiceal intussusception is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging tests, such as an abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for appendiceal intussusception is usually surgery to remove the appendix. In some cases, a non-surgical approach may be possible.

The prognosis for appendiceal intussusception is usually good. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most people make a full recovery.

Acute appendicitis is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. This can cause severe pain, fever, and nausea. If not treated, acute appendicitis can lead to rupture of the appendix, which can be life-threatening.

Cecal diverticulum is a small, pouch-like protrusion that can form in the lining of the cecum, the first part of the large intestine. Most people with cecal diverticula do not have any symptoms, but in some cases, they can cause pain, infection, or bleeding.

Carcinoid tumor of the appendix is a rare type of cancer that can develop in the appendix. Carcinoid tumors are usually slow-growing and do not spread to other parts of the body, but in some cases, they can become malignant.

The following are some of the reasons why D. Appendiceal intussusception is the correct answer while the rest choices are incorrect:

* The patient's symptoms are consistent with appendiceal intussusception. She presented with right lower quadrant pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. These are all common symptoms of appendiceal intussusception.
* The patient's laboratory results are consistent with appendiceal intussusception. She had a leukocytosis, which is an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood. White blood cells are often elevated in cases of inflammation.
* The patient's imaging studies are consistent with appendiceal intussusception. The abdominal CT scan showed a mass in the right lower quadrant, which is consistent with an intussusception. The ultrasound showed a thickened appendix, which is also consistent with an intussusception.
* The patient's treatment was consistent with appendiceal intussusception. She underwent surgery to remove the appendix. This is the standard treatment for appendiceal intussusception.

The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms as well as appendiceal intussusception does. For example, acute appendicitis can cause right lower quadrant pain, but it is not associated with loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting. Cecal diverticulum can cause pain, but it is not associated with fever or nausea. Carcinoid tumor of the appendix is a rare cancer that is not associated with the symptoms that the patient presented with.

 97%|█████████▋| 1472/1525 [5:58:55<12:30, 14.16s/it]The correct answer is A. Do not intervene; the condition is benign.

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a slowly enlarging growth in his mouth that appeared more than 20 years ago. He denies pain and discomfort but is concerned because the mass has increased in size during the past year. He does not wear dentures and denies trauma, use of tobacco products, poor nutrition, and risky sexual practices. Family history is noncontributory. Physical examination reveals a healthy appearing male with a nontender, symmetric, nodular bony protuberance on the midline of the hard palate. Two prominent protuberances are also noted at the bilateral maxillary tuberosities. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.

The most likely diagnosis is an osteoma, which is a benign (noncancerous) tumor of bone. Osteomas are often asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, if the lesion is causing pain or discomfort, or if it is growing rapidly, it may be necessary to remove it.

In this case, the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion has been present for more than 20 years. There is no evidence of malignancy on physical examination or imaging studies. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to do nothing and monitor the lesion closely.

If the lesion were to start to grow rapidly or cause pain, then it could be removed surgically. However, there is no need to intervene at this time.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Perform a biopsy of the lesion. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the body and examined under a microscope to determine whether it is cancerous. In this case, there is no evidence of malignancy on physical examination or imaging studies, so a biopsy is not necessary.
* Option C: Obtain a computed tomography scan of the head. A CT scan is a type of imaging study that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the inside of the body. In this case, a CT scan is not necessary because there is no evidence of malignancy on physical examination or imaging studies.
* Option D: Refer the patient to an oral surgeon for evaluation and full-mouth dental x-rays. An oral surgeon is a dentist who specializes in surgery of the mouth and jaws. In this case, there is no need to refer the patient to an oral surgeon because the lesion is benign and does not require treatment.

 97%|█████████▋| 1473/1525 [5:59:11<12:47, 14.75s/it]The correct answer is C. Recommend removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment.

The patient has a subungual and acral pigmented lesion on her left middle finger that has been present for 10 years. The lesion has widened and darkened, and the pigment has spread to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin. She has no associated symptoms, including nail splitting, bleeding, or pain, and no history of acute or recurrent trauma. Several years previously, she was reassured that her nail pigmentation was benign.

The differential diagnosis for subungual and acral pigmented lesions includes benign conditions such as melanocytic nevi and hematomas, as well as malignant conditions such as melanoma. Melanoma is a potentially fatal skin cancer that can arise in any area of the body, including the nails. The most common type of melanoma that affects the nails is acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), which accounts for approximately 3-10% of all melanomas. ALM is a particularly aggressive form of melanoma that is often difficult to diagnose early due to its location on the palms, soles, and under the nails.

The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for ALM. The lesion has been present for 10 years, which is longer than the typical time frame for a benign melanocytic nevus. The lesion has also widened and darkened, which are signs of progression. The spread of pigment to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin is also concerning.

Given the patient's history and physical examination, a punch biopsy of the nail bed through the intact nail plate is not adequate. A punch biopsy only samples a small area of tissue, and it may not be able to capture the full extent of the lesion. A representative biopsy of all areas of pigment is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.

Removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. This will allow for a complete evaluation of the lesion and will provide the most accurate diagnosis. If the lesion is found to be malignant, removal of the nail plate will also allow for treatment of the cancer.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide adequate information for a definitive diagnosis. Reassuring the patient that her nail pigmentation is benign is not appropriate given the concerning history and physical examination. Sending clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture is not adequate because it does not sample the entire lesion.

 97%|█████████▋| 1474/1525 [5:59:21<11:14, 13.23s/it]The correct answer is D: Contact patient’s hepatologist.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, which is a liver disease. The presentation of blurred vision, cotton-wool spots, and retinal hemorrhages is consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a neurological disorder that can occur in patients with liver disease. PRES is a medical emergency and requires treatment, usually with steroids.

The patient's hepatologist is the best person to manage her care and determine the best course of treatment for PRES. The hepatologist will likely order further tests, such as a brain MRI, to confirm the diagnosis of PRES and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The hepatologist will also likely recommend that the patient discontinue interferon therapy, which is a medication used to treat hepatitis C. Interferon therapy can cause PRES, so it is important to stop this medication if the patient has PRES.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for a patient with PRES.

Choice A, check hemoglobin A1c level, is incorrect because the patient's hemoglobin A1c level is not relevant to the diagnosis or management of PRES. Hemoglobin A1c is a test that measures a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. It is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. However, it is not used to diagnose or manage PRES.

Choice B, check for hypertension, is incorrect because the patient's blood pressure is not relevant to the diagnosis or management of PRES. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular problems. However, it is not a risk factor for PRES.

Choice C, discontinue interferon therapy, is incorrect because the patient's interferon therapy is not the cause of her PRES. Interferon therapy can cause PRES, but it is not the cause of PRES in this patient. The patient's PRES is most likely caused by her liver disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Contact patient’s hepatologist.

 97%|█████████▋| 1475/1525 [5:59:37<11:50, 14.21s/it]The correct diagnosis is scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The mite burrows into the skin and lays eggs, which cause an itchy rash. The rash is often described as being like "ants in the pants."

The patient in the case report has a history of exposure to scabies, as her father works in a nursing home that has experienced a recent outbreak. She also has a rash that is consistent with scabies, with numerous erythematous papules and pustules on her back, many with overlying hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale. In addition, several grouped papules were noted, including some in a linear array. This is a classic presentation of scabies.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. The rash associated with Langerhans cell histiocytosis is typically non-pruritic and does not have the characteristic features of scabies.

Contact dermatitis is a skin reaction caused by contact with an irritant or allergen. The rash associated with contact dermatitis is typically localized to the area of contact and does not have the characteristic features of scabies.

Postscabetic acropustulosis is a rare condition that can occur after scabies infection. It is characterized by the development of grouped papules and pustules on the hands, feet, and face. The patient in the case report does not have the characteristic features of postscabetic acropustulosis.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is scabies. The patient's history, physical examination, and rash are all consistent with scabies. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

 97%|█████████▋| 1476/1525 [5:59:50<11:07, 13.63s/it]The correct diagnosis is angioleiomyoma. Angioleiomyomas are benign tumors of smooth muscle cells that typically occur in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. They are rarely found in the liver, and when they do occur, they are usually asymptomatic. In this case, the patient presented with a pulsatile mass in the midepigastrium, which is a common presentation for angioleiomyomas. Imaging studies showed a well-circumscribed, 3-cm lesion surrounding the common hepatic artery. This is consistent with the appearance of angioleiomyomas on imaging. Histologic examination of the resected lesion showed small, singly dispersed vessels embedded in a background of fascicles of spindled cells with monotonous, fusiform nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. This is also consistent with the appearance of angioleiomyomas on histology. Finally, the tumor cells showed strong cytoplasmic expression of the smooth-muscle marker desmin, which is a specific marker for angioleiomyomas.

Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms are false aneurysms that occur when the wall of the hepatic artery weakens and ruptures. They are typically caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation. In this case, the patient did not have any history of trauma, infection, or inflammation, and there was no evidence of rupture on imaging studies. Therefore, a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm is not the most likely diagnosis.

Neuroendocrine tumors are a group of tumors that arise from neuroendocrine cells. They can occur anywhere in the body, including the liver. In this case, the patient did not have any symptoms that are typically associated with neuroendocrine tumors, such as diarrhea, flushing, or weight loss. Additionally, the tumor did not show any features on imaging studies or histology that are characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors. Therefore, a neuroendocrine tumor is not the most likely diagnosis.

Angiosarcomas are malignant tumors of endothelial cells. They are rare, and when they do occur, they are usually found in the skin, soft tissues, or liver. In this case, the patient did not have any symptoms that are typically associated with angiosarcomas, such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Additionally, the tumor did not show any features on imaging studies or histology that are characteristic of angiosarcomas. Therefore, an angiosarcoma is not the most likely diagnosis.

A hedrocele is a protrusion of the mucosa of the rectum through the anal canal. It is caused by a weakness in the anal sphincter muscle. The mass is usually covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, but no digestive lumen can be identified inside the mass.

A rectal prolapse is a protrusion of the rectum through the anus. It is caused by a weakening of the muscles and tissues that support the rectum. The mass is usually covered by normal rectal mucosa, and a digestive lumen can be identified inside the mass.

An anal neoplasm is a tumor of the anus. It can be benign or malignant. The mass is usually covered by normal anal mucosa, and a digestive lumen can be identified inside the mass.

External hemorrhoids are enlarged veins in the anus. They are caused by increased pressure in the veins of the anus. The mass is usually covered by normal anal mucosa, and a digestive lumen can be identified inside the mass.

In this case, the patient has a painful anal mass that is exteriorized through the anal canal. It is covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, but no digestive lumen can be identified inside the mass. The patient also has a distended abdomen, absent bowel sounds, and no tenderness to palpation. These findings are consistent with a hedrocele.

The patient presents with oral ulcers and a rash on her palms. The oral ulcers are suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and the rash is suggestive of erythema multiforme (EM). EM is a cutaneous reaction pattern that can be caused by a variety of infections, including HSV.

A viral culture from a lip lesion is the most appropriate test to diagnose HSV infection. A chest radiograph is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of pneumonia or other pulmonary infection. A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is used to screen for syphilis, but the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of syphilis. A skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm is not necessary, as the diagnosis of EM is clinical and can be made without a biopsy.

The following is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

* A: Order a chest radiograph. This is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of pneumonia or other pulmonary infection.
* B: Order a rapid plasma reagin test. This is used to screen for syphilis, but the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of syphilis.
* C: Perform a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm for pathologic evaluation. This is not necessary, as the diagnosis of EM is clinical and can be made without a biopsy.

The patient is immunocompromised due to his treatment for multiple sclerosis. He has recently developed tender skin eruptions adjacent to the anus and on the left shin. His physician has prescribed a combination cream of betamethasone diproprionate and clotrimazole for these lesions, but the lesions have not improved.

The most likely cause of the patient's skin lesions is an infection with a bacterium. This is because the patient is immunocompromised, which makes him more susceptible to infection. The lesions are also located in areas that are susceptible to bacterial infection, such as the perianal area and the shin.

The next step in the management of the patient's skin lesions is to obtain tissue for bacterial culture from both the perianal area and the left shin. This will allow the identification of the bacterium causing the infection, so that the most appropriate antibiotic can be prescribed.

It is also important to start the patient on a systemic antibiotic, even before the culture results are available. This is because the patient is immunocompromised and may be at risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening infection of the blood.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A is incorrect because it does not include the necessary step of obtaining tissue for bacterial culture.
* Option C is incorrect because it is not necessary to obtain both a bacterial culture and a fungal culture. The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a bacterial infection, so a bacterial culture is the most important test to perform.
* Option D is incorrect because it is not necessary to initiate systemic antifungal therapy at this time. The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a bacterial infection, so a systemic antibiotic is the most appropriate treatment.

Erythema nodosum is a skin condition that causes red, tender lumps on the lower legs. It is often associated with other conditions, such as infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. The patient in this case does not have any of these conditions, and the skin lesion is not typical of erythema nodosum.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, including the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of sarcoidosis, and the skin lesion is not typical of sarcoidosis.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect any part of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. The patient in this case has some symptoms of SLE, such as joint pain and fatigue. However, the skin lesion is not typical of SLE.

Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a rare side effect of minocycline, a type of antibiotic. It is characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin.

Biliary cystadenomas are benign tumors that arise from the epithelium of the bile ducts. They are typically solitary and occur in women of middle age. Biliary cystadenomas are often asymptomatic, but can present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. The diagnosis is made on imaging studies, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment is surgical excision.

Amebic liver abscesses are caused by infection with the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. They are most common in tropical and subtropical regions, but can occur anywhere in the world. Amebic liver abscesses are typically seen in young adults, and are more common in men than women. The most common presentation is with fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. The diagnosis is made on imaging studies, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Treatment is with metronidazole.

Cystic hepatocellular carcinomas are rare, malignant tumors that arise from the hepatocytes of the liver. They are more common in men than women, and typically occur in patients over the age of 50. Cystic hepatocellular carcinomas are often asymptomatic, but can present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made on imaging studies, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Treatment is with surgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a 1-year history of dull epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She has no history of liver disease or malignancy. On physical examination, she has a tender liver edge. Imaging studies reveal two multiloculated cystic lesions in segments IV and V of the liver. A biopsy of one of the lesions reveals atypical cells suspicious for malignancy. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and enucleation of the lesions. The pathology report showed metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors.

The diagnosis of metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy results. The patient's age, sex, and lack of a history of liver disease or malignancy are all consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors. The patient's abdominal pain, tenderness on physical examination, and multiloculated cystic lesions on imaging studies are also consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors. The biopsy results showing atypical cells suspicious for malignancy are definitive for a diagnosis of metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation in a comprehensive manner. Biliary cystadenomas are benign tumors that typically present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. Amebic liver abscesses are caused by infection with the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica and typically present with fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. Cystic hepatocellular carcinomas are rare, malignant tumors that typically present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss.

A. Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma is incorrect because the patient had a history of left breast invasive ductal carcinoma in 2007 treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation as well as synchronous rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation and abdominoperineal resection. As part of her treatment course, the patient received a total dose of 50.5 Gy pelvic irradiation and 60 Gy irradiation to the left breast and axillary basin. The patient was followed up with yearly computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis in addition to yearly digital mammography. Her last mammogram, 5 months prior to presentation, was unremarkable. This suggests that the patient's chest wall mass is a new primary tumor, not a metastasis from her previous rectal cancer.

C. Metastatic breast carcinoma is incorrect because the patient's chest wall mass is a spindle cell sarcoma, not a carcinoma. Spindle cell sarcomas are a type of soft tissue sarcoma, which are a group of rare cancers that arise from the connective tissue of the body. Carcinomas, on the other hand, are a type of cancer that arises from epithelial tissue, which is the tissue that lines the organs and cavities of the body.

D. Desmoid tumor of chest wall is incorrect because the patient's chest wall mass is a spindle cell sarcoma, not a desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors are a type of benign (non-cancerous) tumor that arises from the connective tissue of the body. Spindle cell sarcomas, on the other hand, are a type of soft tissue sarcoma, which are a group of rare cancers that arise from the connective tissue of the body.

 97%|█████████▋| 1484/1525 [6:01:41<09:59, 14.63s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform an incisional skin biopsy.

A blood culture is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection. A computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of malignancy or other serious medical conditions. A tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of tuberculosis.

An incisional skin biopsy is the best way to diagnose the patient's condition. The biopsy will allow the doctor to obtain a sample of the patient's skin to examine under a microscope. This will help the doctor to determine the cause of the patient's nodules and to recommend the best course of treatment.

The other choices are not necessary in this case because they will not help the doctor to diagnose the patient's condition or to recommend the best course of treatment.

 97%|█████████▋| 1485/1525 [6:01:57<09:55, 14.88s/it]The correct answer is D. Tinea incognito.

Tinea incognito is a form of ringworm that is caused by a fungal infection. It is most commonly seen in people who have been treated with topical steroids, such as desonide. The steroids can suppress the immune system, making the person more susceptible to fungal infections.

The rash associated with tinea incognito is typically a ring-shaped lesion with central clearing and peripheral scaling and erythema. The lesions can be itchy and may be painful.

Tinea incognito is treated with antifungal medications, such as griseofulvin or terbinafine. The lesions usually clear up within a few weeks of treatment.

Here are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* Numular eczema is a type of eczema that is characterized by small, coin-shaped lesions. The lesions are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Numular eczema is not caused by a fungal infection.
* Erythema annulare centrifugum is a skin condition that is characterized by ring-shaped lesions. The lesions are typically red, scaly, and raised. Erythema annulare centrifugum is not caused by a fungal infection.
* Erythema chronicum migrans is a skin condition that is caused by infection with the Lyme bacterium. The rash is typically a large, expanding ring-shaped lesion. Erythema chronicum migrans is not caused by a fungal infection.

 97%|█████████▋| 1486/1525 [6:02:09<09:13, 14.20s/it]The correct answer is A. Glucagonoma.

A glucagonoma is a rare type of pancreatic tumor that produces too much glucagon, a hormone that helps the body regulate blood sugar levels. The symptoms of glucagonoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor, but they often include weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and skin rash.

In this case, the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, anorexia, and weight loss are consistent with glucagonoma. The skin rash is also a characteristic symptom of glucagonoma, and it is often described as a "necrolytic migratory erythema." This type of rash is typically characterized by multiple, sharply demarcated, erythematous plaques with central necrosis and ulceration.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Insulinoma is a type of pancreatic tumor that produces too much insulin, a hormone that lowers blood sugar levels. Insulinoma would not be expected to cause weight loss or diarrhea. VIPoma is a type of pancreatic tumor that produces too much vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a hormone that causes diarrhea and flushing. VIPoma would not be expected to cause skin rash or weight loss. Skin amyloidosis is a condition in which amyloid proteins are deposited in the skin. Amyloid proteins are abnormal proteins that can build up in organs and tissues, leading to a variety of health problems. Skin amyloidosis would not be expected to cause weight loss or diarrhea.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Glucagonoma. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus, anorexia, and weight loss are consistent with glucagonoma. The skin rash is also a characteristic symptom of glucagonoma, and it is often described as a "necrolytic migratory erythema."

 98%|█████████▊| 1487/1525 [6:02:26<09:26, 14.90s/it]The correct answer is C. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy.

Subacute bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves that can cause fever, chills, and a heart murmur. It is not associated with the skin findings described in the case.

Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy that can cause skin necrosis, especially in the lower extremities. It is not associated with the other findings described in the case.

Buerger disease is a rare, inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that typically affects the hands and feet. It is not associated with the other findings described in the case.

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy is a condition that occurs in people with end-stage renal disease. It is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the walls of small arteries, which can lead to narrowing of the arteries and decreased blood flow to the tissues. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and skin changes.

The patient in the case has several risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy, including end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He also has several clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis, including pain and necrosis of the fingers, toes, and calves. The skin biopsy specimen showed epidermal necrosis, dermal hemorrhage, focal dermal intravascular thrombi, and subcutaneous intravascular and extravascular calcifications. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of calcific uremic arteriolopathy.

 98%|█████████▊| 1488/1525 [6:02:42<09:30, 15.41s/it]The correct answer is C. Perform angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery.

The patient presents with exertional right buttock and thigh pain that resolves within 2 minutes of rest. This is consistent with claudication, which is a condition caused by narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the legs. The patient's history of hypertension and the findings on physical examination and imaging studies are consistent with the diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a nonatherosclerotic disorder that can cause narrowing of the arteries.

FMD is a treatable condition, and the goal of treatment is to improve blood flow to the legs and relieve symptoms. Angioplasty and stenting is a minimally invasive procedure that is often used to treat FMD. In this procedure, a balloon is inserted into the narrowed artery and inflated, which widens the artery and improves blood flow. A stent, a small metal tube, may be inserted into the artery to keep it open.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and have not responded to conservative management. Therefore, angioplasty and stenting of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery is the best option to improve blood flow to the legs and relieve symptoms.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Manage medically with antihypertensive agents and a walking program. This is not an appropriate option for this patient because her symptoms are severe and have not responded to conservative management.
* Option B: Perform angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty of the right external iliac artery. This is not an appropriate option because it does not address the long-segment stenosis of the right external iliac artery.
* Option D: Administer cilostazol for claudication and continue lisinopril for hypertension. This is not an appropriate option because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

 98%|█████████▊| 1489/1525 [6:02:57<09:06, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is B. Ecthyma gangrenosum.

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare, rapidly progressive skin infection that is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with neutropenia. It is caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum are typically painful, violaceous papules or nodules that become necrotic and ulcerated. They are often associated with fever, chills, and leukocytosis.

The diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum is made clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. Laboratory tests may be helpful in identifying the underlying organism, but they are not always necessary. Treatment of ecthyma gangrenosum is with antibiotics, often in combination with surgical debridement of the lesions.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic, non-infectious skin condition that is characterized by painful, ulcerative lesions. It is most commonly seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders.
* Wegener granulomatosis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by necrotizing granulomas in the affected tissues.
* Meningococcemia is a serious bacterial infection of the blood and meninges (the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord). It is characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, and a characteristic rash.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Ecthyma gangrenosum. The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical presentation of the patient.

 98%|█████████▊| 1490/1525 [6:03:14<09:10, 15.74s/it]The correct answer is C. Internal iliac artery aneurysm. The patient has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation while receiving warfarin sodium, congestive heart failure, extended right hemicolectomy for colon cancer, and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. These are all risk factors for developing an internal iliac artery aneurysm. The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, worsening lower back and lower extremity pain, constipation, urinary incontinence, and generalized weakness are all consistent with an internal iliac artery aneurysm. The physical examination finding of a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant is also consistent with an internal iliac artery aneurysm. The laboratory test results are unremarkable, which is consistent with an internal iliac artery aneurysm. The computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis shows a large, fusiform aneurysm of the left internal iliac artery. This finding is diagnostic of an internal iliac artery aneurysm.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Prostate cancer is unlikely in this patient because he is 88 years old and has no history of prostate cancer.
* B. Recurrent colon cancer is unlikely in this patient because he has no history of colon cancer that has recurred.
* D. Primary lymphoma of the urinary bladder is unlikely in this patient because he has no history of lymphoma and the computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis does not show any evidence of lymphoma.

 98%|█████████▊| 1491/1525 [6:03:28<08:41, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is C. Squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's history of cigarette smoking, the presence of a ball-like mass with an air crescent sign on chest CT, and the finding of a whitish, firm nodule about 2 cm in a cavity in the left upper lung are all consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.

Pulmonary aspergilloma is a fungal infection that can cause a ball-like mass in the lung. However, it is typically not associated with hemoptysis or an air crescent sign. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a cavitary lesion in the lung. However, it is typically not associated with a ball-like mass or an air crescent sign. Pulmonary hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection that can cause a cavitary lesion in the lung. However, it is typically not associated with a ball-like mass or an air crescent sign.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that is most common in people who smoke. It is typically a slow-growing cancer, but it can spread to other parts of the body if it is not treated. The most common symptom of squamous cell carcinoma is a persistent cough. Other symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis.

The treatment for squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma may be treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The prognosis for squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma is typically curable, but advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma is often fatal.

 98%|█████████▊| 1492/1525 [6:03:45<08:41, 15.80s/it]The correct answer is D. Postpone treatment; obtain random skin biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy.

The patient has multiple cerebral infarctions and intracranial vessel abnormalities. The most likely cause is vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. Vasculitis can be caused by a number of different conditions, including autoimmune diseases, infections, and drugs.

The first step in treating vasculitis is to determine the cause. This can be done by a number of tests, including blood tests, imaging tests, and biopsies. In this case, the patient has already had a number of tests, including blood tests, MRI, and digital subtraction angiography. These tests have not been able to determine the cause of the vasculitis.

The next step is to treat the underlying cause of the vasculitis. If the vasculitis is caused by an autoimmune disease, then the treatment will be with immunosuppressive drugs. If the vasculitis is caused by an infection, then the treatment will be with antibiotics. If the vasculitis is caused by drugs, then the treatment will be to stop taking the drugs.

In this case, the cause of the vasculitis has not been determined. Therefore, it is not possible to start treatment for the vasculitis. The best course of action is to postpone treatment and obtain more tests to determine the cause of the vasculitis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not be the best course of action in this case.

Answer A: Initiate secondary preventive treatment for multiple infarctions with antiplatelet agents.

This is not the best course of action because the cause of the vasculitis has not been determined. Antiplatelet agents are used to prevent blood clots, but they would not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the vasculitis.

Answer B: Initiate treatment for cerebral vasculitis with corticosteroids.

This is not the best course of action because the cause of the vasculitis has not been determined. Corticosteroids are used to treat autoimmune diseases, but they would not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the vasculitis if it is not caused by an autoimmune disease.

Answer C: Postpone treatment; obtain a brain biopsy including the leptomeninges.

This is not the best course of action because a brain biopsy is not necessary in this case. The patient has already had a number of tests, including MRI, which have not been able to determine the cause of the vasculitis. A brain biopsy would be a risky procedure with a small chance of providing any useful information.

Therefore, the best course of action is to postpone treatment and obtain more tests to determine the cause of the vasculitis.

 98%|█████████▊| 1493/1525 [6:04:00<08:12, 15.40s/it]The correct answer is C. Obtain lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains.

The patient in the case presentation has a mildly pruritic, progressive rash that began in his scalp and subsequently spread over 9 days’ time to his neck, back, and chest. He had been seen in the emergency department and prescribed oral cephalexin for the eruption, with no improvement. He denies any other use of medication (including prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, and vitamins) in the days, weeks, or months prior to onset. He denies any travel or illicit drug use. The patient otherwise feels well, without fever, chills, or systemic symptoms. He has received appropriate immunizations, has no relevant family history, and has never experienced similar episodes. The physical examination is notable for numerous grouped vesicles and relatively monomorphic tense bullae, coalescing into markedly annular plaques, superimposed on erythematous bases with central clearing and scale. The eruption is generalized and symmetric but predominates on his posterior neck, back, chest and upper arms (Figure 1), and inner thighs. He is otherwise afebrile and appears well.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's rash is broad and includes a number of vesiculobullous disorders, such as pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. In order to narrow the differential diagnosis and make a definitive diagnosis, it is necessary to obtain skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains.

Histopathology can provide information about the level of the skin at which the blisters are forming, the type of inflammatory cells present, and the presence of any specific immune deposits. Direct immunofluorescence can be used to detect the presence of specific antibodies in the skin, which can be helpful in diagnosing autoimmune blistering disorders such as pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Empirically treat with topical corticosteroids is incorrect because the patient's rash is not responding to oral cephalexin, which suggests that it is not likely to be caused by a bacterial infection. In addition, topical corticosteroids can worsen the condition of some vesiculobullous disorders, such as pemphigus vulgaris.
* Option B: Obtain blister fluid culture, Gram stain, and viral polymerase chain reaction assay is incorrect because the patient's rash is not likely to be caused by a bacterial or viral infection. In addition, these tests are not specific for vesiculobullous disorders.
* Option D: Transfer to burn unit for intensive supportive care is incorrect because the patient's rash is not life-threatening. In addition, there is no evidence that the patient is suffering from any complications of his rash that would require transfer to a burn unit.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Obtain lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains. This will help to narrow the differential diagnosis and make a definitive diagnosis.

 98%|█████████▊| 1494/1525 [6:04:16<08:06, 15.69s/it]The correct answer is C: Vitreous biopsy.

The patient presented with a "smudge" in the central vision of her right eye with associated photopsias. On examination, visual acuity measured 20/50 OD. Her local ophthalmologist considered a white dot syndrome and recommended a systemic workup. Results of a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antinuclear antibodies (including DNA and ribosomal SSA/Ro), positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, mammography, and chest radiography were normal. Dermatologic examination revealed a nevus on the left arm, a nevus on her left shoulder, and seborrheic keratosis on her left shoulder. Three months later, at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, she reported an improvement in her vision but noted negative images of dots when her right eye was closed. Review of systems was negative. Visual acuities measured 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS. Slitlamp examination findings were normal; there were no anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Funduscopic examination revealed yellow-white, multisized, subretinal, creamy lesions clumped in various portions of her retina, including the periphery (Figure 1). The lesions were smaller in the posterior pole and larger in the periphery. Subretinal serous fluid was present overlying some of the prominent lesions inferiorly, without associated exudate or hemorrhage.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes:

* White dot syndrome: This is a group of disorders that can cause white lesions in the retina. The most common cause of white dot syndrome is age-related macular degeneration. Other causes include multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, serpiginous choroiditis, and punctate inner choroidopathy.
* Retinal detachment: This is a condition in which the retina separates from the underlying choroid. Retinal detachment can be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.
* Vitreous hemorrhage: This is a condition in which blood leaks into the vitreous humor, the clear fluid that fills the inside of the eye. Vitreous hemorrhage can be caused by trauma, infection, or inflammation.
* Choroidal neovascularization: This is a condition in which new blood vessels grow in the choroid, the layer of tissue that lies between the retina and the sclera. Choroidal neovascularization can be caused by age-related macular degeneration, diabetes, or other conditions.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a vitreous biopsy. A vitreous biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of vitreous humor is removed from the eye. The vitreous biopsy can be used to diagnose the cause of the patient's white lesions and to determine the best course of treatment.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not the next step in the management of this patient.

* Observation: Observation is not the next step in the management of this patient because the patient has already been observed for three months without improvement.
* Oral corticosteroid: Oral corticosteroid is not the next step in the management of this patient because oral corticosteroid is not effective for the treatment of white dot syndrome.
* Extended workup: Extended workup is not the next step in the management of this patient because the patient has already undergone a complete systemic workup, which was normal.

A congenital melanocytic nevus is a type of birthmark that is made up of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. It is the most common type of nevus, and it can be found anywhere on the body. Congenital melanocytic nevi are usually harmless, but they can sometimes develop into melanoma, a type of skin cancer.

An epidermal nevus is a type of birthmark that is made up of abnormal skin cells. It can be found anywhere on the body, and it can be different colors, including red, brown, and black. Epidermal nevi are usually harmless, but they can sometimes be associated with other medical problems.

Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn is a type of nevus that is made up of sebaceous glands, the glands that produce oil. It is usually found on the head or face, and it can be different colors, including yellow, brown, and red. Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn can sometimes develop into tumors, but it is usually harmless.

Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus is a type of nevus that is made up of abnormal skin cells. It is usually found on the arms or legs, and it can be different colors, including red, brown, and black. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus can sometimes cause itching and pain, and it can sometimes develop into tumors.

The patient in the case presented with a lesion that had been present since birth. The lesion expanded in size, became irritated, and developed a papillated, rough texture. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

The symptoms of intussusception of the appendix include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis is made with abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. The treatment is surgical removal of the appendix.

Carcinoma of the cecum is a type of cancer that starts in the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. The symptoms of carcinoma of the cecum include abdominal pain, weight loss, and blood in the stool. The diagnosis is made with colonoscopy or CT scan. The treatment is surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Ileocecal intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the small intestine telescopes into another portion of the small intestine. It is the most common cause of intussusception in adults. The symptoms of ileocecal intussusception include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis is made with abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. The treatment is surgical removal of the intussusception.

Diverticulum of the cecum is a condition in which a small pouch forms in the wall of the cecum. Diverticula are common in older adults. The symptoms of diverticulum of the cecum include abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation. The diagnosis is made with abdominal CT scan or colonoscopy. The treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be necessary if the diverticulum is infected or bleeding.

The correct diagnosis is intussusception of the appendix because the patient has the classic symptoms of intussusception, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis is confirmed with abdominal ultrasound, which shows a tubular mass in the cecum. The treatment is surgical removal of the appendix.

A duplicate gallbladder is a rare congenital anomaly in which there are two separate gallbladders. It is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging studies.

A biliary cystadenoma is a benign tumor of the bile ducts. It is usually found in older women and can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis.

A hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection of the liver caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It is most common in areas where sheep are raised, such as the Mediterranean region and Central Asia. Symptoms of hydatid cyst can include abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice.

The patient in the case presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Imaging studies showed a cystic abnormality in the region of the porta hepatis. These findings are consistent with a choledochal cyst. Choledochal cysts are congenital abnormalities of the bile duct that are more common in women and children. They can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. The most common type of choledochal cyst is type 1, which is characterized by a cystic dilation of the common bile duct. Treatment of choledochal cysts usually involves surgery to remove the cyst and repair the bile duct.

The patient has a bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). BRONJ is a rare, but serious, complication of bisphosphonate therapy. It is characterized by exposed bone in the jaw, with or without associated infection.

The most common treatment for BRONJ is extraction of the affected teeth and coverage of the exposed bone with a gingival graft. However, this is not always necessary. In some cases, antibiotics and chlorhexidine mouthwashes can be used to treat the infection and prevent further bone loss.

In this case, the patient has no tenderness on palpation or profound gingival bleeding. This suggests that the infection is not severe and that extraction of the teeth is not necessary. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to prescribe antibiotics and chlorhexidine mouthwashes.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Extract the involved teeth and cover the exposed bone with a gingival graft: This is not necessary in this case, as the infection is not severe.
* B. Obtain radiographs of the mandible: This may be helpful in diagnosing BRONJ, but it is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is already clear.
* D. Remove the whole section of the mandibular bone, including the involved teeth, to achieve bone coverage by soft tissue; if necessary, reconstruct using surgical plates: This is a very aggressive treatment that is not necessary in this case.

The patient presents with sudden-onset, painless blurred vision in her right eye. She describes it as a black lace over her field of vision that she first noticed after waking 8 days prior to presentation. Owing to worsening vision, she was referred to us for further evaluation. She has no systemic symptoms and no past ocular or systemic health problems. She does not take any medications. She is currently working and lives at home with her male partner and her pets. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol socially. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a right relative afferent pupil defect. The results of a slitlamp examination of the intraocular pressure, motility, and anterior segment in both eyes are unremarkable. Dilated examination findings of the left eye are normal. Results of a dilated examination of the right eye reveal a clear vitreous body, tortuous veins, and macula lutea, as shown in Figure 1.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and central retinal vein occlusion. Optic neuritis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient given her history of sudden-onset, painless blurred vision in her right eye. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve that can be caused by a variety of factors, including multiple sclerosis, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases.

To confirm the diagnosis of optic neuritis, the next step in management is to order serologic tests to rule out infectious and autoimmune causes. These tests may include a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, and an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test.

If the serologic tests are negative, the patient may need to undergo additional testing, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and orbits. An MRI scan can help to rule out other potential causes of optic neuritis, such as multiple sclerosis.

The treatment for optic neuritis typically includes corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids can be given orally or intravenously. In some cases, patients may also need to be treated with plasmapheresis, which is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma.

The prognosis for optic neuritis is generally good. Most patients with optic neuritis recover their vision completely or almost completely. However, some patients may have permanent vision loss. The risk of permanent vision loss is higher in patients with multiple sclerosis.

A. Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits is not the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a mass lesion or other structural abnormality.

B. Use antibiotics is not the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an infectious process.

C. Use steroids is not the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an autoimmune process.

 98%|█████████▊| 1500/1525 [6:05:42<05:53, 14.13s/it]The correct answer is C. Proboscis lateralis. A proboscis lateralis is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a trunklike projection from the medial canthus of the eye. It is caused by a failure of the medial nasal process to fuse with the lateral nasal process during embryogenesis. The trunk is usually lined with skin and contains cartilage, muscle, and nerves. There may also be an opening at the tip of the trunk that connects to the nasal cavity.

The diagnosis of proboscis lateralis is made based on the clinical presentation. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the abnormality.

There is no cure for proboscis lateralis. Treatment is aimed at improving the cosmetic appearance and function of the affected area. This may include surgery to remove the trunk, repair any associated defects, and reconstruct the nasal area.

A supernumerary nostril is an extra opening on the nose. It is caused by a failure of the nasal placodes to fuse during embryogenesis. Supernumerary nostrils are usually small and asymptomatic. However, they can sometimes become infected or cause problems with breathing. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

A nasal encephalocele is a protrusion of brain tissue through a defect in the skull. It is caused by a failure of the skull to close properly during embryogenesis. Nasal encephaloceles are usually associated with other congenital anomalies, such as hydrocephalus and cleft lip and palate. Treatment is usually surgical repair.

Cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of the brain, eyes, and nose. It is caused by a mutation in the FOXC1 gene. Cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, intellectual disability, vision problems, and facial abnormalities. Treatment is usually supportive and may include surgery to correct the facial abnormalities.

In the case of the 10-day-old girl, the most likely diagnosis is proboscis lateralis. This is because the girl has a trunklike projection from the medial canthus of the left eye, which is the classic presentation of proboscis lateralis. The girl also has no other craniofacial anomalies, which makes supernumerary nostril and nasal encephalocele less likely. Finally, the girl has no history of teratogenic exposure, no family history of congenital defects, and no history of consanguinity, which makes cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome less likely.

 98%|█████████▊| 1501/1525 [6:05:54<05:24, 13.53s/it]The correct answer is B. Gossypiboma.

A gossypiboma is a foreign body that is composed of gauze or other surgical materials that have been left inside the body after surgery. It is a rare complication of surgery, but it can occur in any type of surgery, including cesarean sections.

The most common symptom of a gossypiboma is a painless abdominal mass. The mass may be present for several years before it is diagnosed. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and fever.

A CT scan is the most common diagnostic test for a gossypiboma. The CT scan will show a well-circumscribed mass that is often located in the abdominal cavity.

The treatment for a gossypiboma is surgical removal of the foreign body. The surgery is usually performed laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure.

The prognosis for patients with gossypibomas is good. Most patients make a full recovery after surgery. However, if the gossypiboma is not treated, it can cause serious complications, such as infection, abscess, and bowel obstruction.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in fat cells. It is a rare cancer, and it is not typically associated with a painless abdominal mass.
* Mesenteric cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in the mesentery, which is the tissue that attaches the intestines to the abdominal wall. Mesenteric cysts are usually benign, and they are not typically associated with a painless abdominal mass.
* Uterine leiomyoma is a type of tumor that can develop in the uterus. Uterine leiomyomas are very common, and they are usually benign. They are not typically associated with a painless abdominal mass.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare, usually benign tumor of the adrenal glands that produces excessive amounts of the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones cause symptoms such as high blood pressure, headache, sweating, and palpitations.

The patient in the case presented with abdominal distention, early satiety, and heat intolerance. These symptoms are consistent with pheochromocytoma. Additionally, the patient had orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when standing up. This is a common symptom of pheochromocytoma.

The abdominal computed tomographic scan showed a large heterogeneous mass in the left abdomen. This is also consistent with a pheochromocytoma.

The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass. The specimen was found to be a pheochromocytoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph nodes. It does not typically cause abdominal distention, early satiety, or heat intolerance.
* Cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is a type of tumor that can develop in the pancreas. It does not typically cause orthostatic hypotension.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the muscles. It does not typically cause abdominal distention, early satiety, or heat intolerance.

 99%|█████████▊| 1503/1525 [6:06:16<04:27, 12.18s/it]The correct answer is B. Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology.

The patient is a 45-year-old man with a localized red plaque on his back that began 4 years ago. The lesion was initially diagnosed as eczema and has been treated with topical steroids without improvement. The physical examination reveals a dark red plaque measuring 3.0 × 4.0 cm on the right upper quadrant of the back. The plaque is irregularly shaped with a defined border and includes several black or brown dot-like petechiae. The plaque appears elevated and infiltrative, with a rough surface covered in waxy white crusts. The physical examination is otherwise negative. Cell count, fasting blood glucose level, and results of a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative test) are all unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for a red plaque on the back includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign conditions include eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and lichen planus. The most common malignant conditions include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

In this case, the patient's lesion is suspicious for a malignant condition. The lesion is a dark red color, which is a common color for melanoma. The lesion is also irregularly shaped and has a defined border, which are also features of melanoma. The presence of black or brown dot-like petechiae within the lesion is a concerning finding, as this can be a sign of ulceration. The patient has no history of eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, or lichen planus, which makes these conditions less likely. The patient's cell count, fasting blood glucose level, and results of a tuberculin skin test are all unremarkable, which makes infection, diabetes, and tuberculosis less likely.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology. A biopsy will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made and will guide further management.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Completely excise the lesion, including margins. This is an aggressive approach that is not necessary in this case. The lesion is not large and does not appear to be invasive. A biopsy will provide enough information to make a diagnosis and guide further management.
* Option C: Perform dermatologic ultrasonography of the lesion. This is a useful imaging modality that can be used to assess the depth of a lesion and to evaluate for invasion. However, it is not necessary in this case. The lesion is superficial and does not appear to be invasive. A biopsy will provide enough information to make a diagnosis and guide further management.
* Option D: Treat with a stronger topical steroid for 2 weeks. This is a conservative approach that may be appropriate for a benign condition. However, it is not appropriate for a malignant condition. The patient's lesion is suspicious for melanoma, which is a serious cancer. A biopsy is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and to guide further management.

 99%|█████████▊| 1504/1525 [6:06:28<04:17, 12.24s/it]The correct answer is C: Do nothing for the CT scan findings.

The patient has a history of a fall and a large hematoma on his right thigh and buttock. He has an elevated white blood cell count and a decreased hemoglobin level. A transthoracic echocardiogram reveals valvular vegetations. Systemic antibiotics are administered for management of Streptococcus viridans endocarditis. On the fourth hospital day, his WBC count increases to 44,000 cells/μL and his hemoglobin level decreases to 6.6 g/dL. A chest radiograph is unrevealing. He is afebrile with normal blood pressure, tachycardiac (119 beats/min), and has an unremarkable abdominal examination. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan obtained to evaluate for blood loss reveals an abnormal gallbladder finding.

The abnormal gallbladder finding is most likely due to acalculous cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones. Acalculous cholecystitis is a common complication of sepsis, and it is thought to be caused by ischemia and infection of the gallbladder wall. The most common symptoms of acalculous cholecystitis are abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is often made based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, such as an elevated white blood cell count and an elevated liver enzyme level. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

The treatment of acalculous cholecystitis is supportive care, including intravenous antibiotics and fluids. In some cases, cholecystectomy may be necessary. However, cholecystectomy is not always necessary, and it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of surgery in each individual patient.

In this case, the patient is already receiving systemic antibiotics for his endocarditis. He is also afebrile and has a normal blood pressure. His abdominal examination is unremarkable. Therefore, there is no evidence that the patient's abnormal gallbladder finding is causing him any significant symptoms or complications. In addition, the patient is at an increased risk for complications from surgery, given his recent fall and history of hematoma. Therefore, the best course of management is to do nothing for the CT scan findings and continue to monitor the patient closely.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Broaden coverage with intravenous antibiotics and proceed with cholecystectomy. This is an aggressive approach that is not necessary in this case. The patient is already receiving systemic antibiotics for his endocarditis, and there is no evidence that his abnormal gallbladder finding is causing him any significant symptoms or complications. In addition, the patient is at an increased risk for complications from surgery, given his recent fall and history of hematoma.
* Option B: Continue intravenous antibiotics and perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is a procedure that is used to diagnose and treat problems with the bile ducts. It is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of biliary obstruction.
* Option D: Perform celiotomy and enterotomy with gallstone extraction. This is a major surgical procedure that is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms or signs of peritonitis, and there is no evidence that his abnormal gallbladder finding is causing him any significant symptoms or complications. In addition, the patient is at an increased risk for complications from surgery, given his recent fall and history of hematoma.

 99%|█████████▊| 1505/1525 [6:06:45<04:29, 13.49s/it]The correct diagnosis is linear IgA dermatosis. This is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that typically affects children and young adults. The most common presentation is with pruritic, bullous skin lesions that often appear on the lower extremities. The lesions may be linear or annular in shape, and they may be associated with erythema and scaling. In some cases, the lesions may become superinfected.

The diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows a linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. This finding is pathognomonic for linear IgA dermatosis.

There is no cure for linear IgA dermatosis, but the condition can be treated with a variety of medications, including topical steroids, oral steroids, and immunosuppressive drugs. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and prevent the development of new lesions.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Herpetiform dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin disorder that is characterized by small, grouped vesicles that are often found on the hands and feet. It is not associated with bullous lesions.
* Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering disorders that are characterized by the formation of flaccid blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type of pemphigus. It is not associated with linear IgA dermatosis.
* Erythema multiforme is a skin condition that is characterized by the sudden onset of round or oval red patches on the skin. It is often associated with a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus or Epstein-Barr virus. It is not associated with linear IgA dermatosis.

Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs when the spleen ruptures without any apparent cause. It is most commonly seen in young adults, and it is often associated with viral infections, such as mononucleosis.

The symptoms of spontaneous rupture of the spleen include sudden, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and shock. The diagnosis is made with abdominal imaging, such as ultrasound or CT scan.

Treatment for spontaneous rupture of the spleen is surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy). This is usually a safe and effective procedure, and most patients recover without any complications.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

* Splenic artery aneurysm rupture is a condition in which an aneurysm, or bulge, forms in the wall of the splenic artery. This can lead to rupture of the artery and bleeding into the abdomen. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. He is afebrile, and his blood pressure is not low.
* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It can cause the spleen to enlarge, but it does not usually cause spontaneous rupture. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It can cause abdominal pain, but it does not usually cause spontaneous rupture of the spleen. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

 99%|█████████▉| 1507/1525 [6:07:16<04:20, 14.45s/it]The correct answer is B. Acute appendiceal diverticulitis.

Acute appendicitis is a common condition that occurs when the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. The most common symptom of acute appendicitis is abdominal pain, which usually starts in the center of the abdomen and then moves to the right lower quadrant. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever, and loss of appetite.

Acute appendicitis is a surgical emergency. If left untreated, it can lead to rupture of the appendix, which can cause peritonitis, a serious infection of the abdominal cavity.

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests and imaging studies. The most common laboratory test used to diagnose acute appendicitis is a white blood cell count, which is usually elevated in patients with appendicitis. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan can help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of abdominal pain.

The treatment for acute appendicitis is surgery to remove the appendix. This is usually done laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure. After surgery, most patients recover quickly and are able to return to their normal activities within a few weeks.

The choice A, Acute appendicitis with colon diverticula, is incorrect because the patient does not have colon diverticula. Colon diverticula are small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. They are common in older adults, and they are usually not harmful. However, in some cases, colon diverticula can become inflamed, a condition called diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as perforation of the colon.

The choice C, Appendiceal diverticulum, is incorrect because the patient does not have a diverticulum. A diverticulum is a small pouch that can form in the lining of the colon. They are common in older adults, and they are usually not harmful. However, in some cases, diverticula can become inflamed, a condition called diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as perforation of the colon.

The choice D, Appendiceal mucocele, is incorrect because the patient does not have a mucocele. A mucocele is a cyst that forms in the appendix. It is caused by blockage of the opening of the appendix, which allows mucus to build up. Mucoceles are usually not harmful, but they can sometimes rupture or become infected. If left untreated, they can lead to complications such as appendicitis.

The patient has necrotic black eschars and scattered stellate purpuric patches on the lower extremities. These are signs of a serious underlying medical condition, such as vasculitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or sepsis. A biopsy of the skin lesion will allow the doctor to determine the specific cause of the patient's condition and to recommend appropriate treatment.

A computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the lower extremities would not be helpful in this case, as it would not provide any information about the cause of the patient's skin lesions. An ultrasound of the lower extremities would also not be helpful, as it is not a sensitive test for vasculitis or DIC. A urine toxicology screen would only be helpful if the patient was suspected of using cocaine, which is not the case in this patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation.

 99%|█████████▉| 1509/1525 [6:07:44<03:47, 14.21s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain a skin biopsy from the pustules.

The patient is an 85-year-old man with lung cancer (stage IV, adenocarcinoma) who was treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitor gefitinib (250 mg/d). One month later, he developed a few erythematous follicular papules with focal scaling on the scalp, which intermittently improved and worsened and were reasonably well controlled with topical corticosteroids. Neither pustules nor hair loss was noted. The cancer was well controlled for 31 months, when his tumor recurred and he was switched to erlotinib (150 mg/d). Subsequently, the number of scalp lesions increased, accompanied by pustules and hair loss. Numerous pustules with an erythematous base were observed on the scalp vertex (Figure 1). Paronychia, pruritus, and dry skin were also present, but the pustular eruption was limited to the scalp. Neither fever nor other constitutional symptoms were noted. Testing of the scalp lesions using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation produced negative results.

A. Do nothing; the rash usually resolves over time.

This is not the correct answer because the patient's rash has not resolved on its own and has actually worsened since he started taking erlotinib. Additionally, the patient has developed new symptoms, such as pustules and hair loss, which suggest that the rash may be more serious than originally thought.

B. Obtain a bacterial culture from the pustules.

This is not the correct answer because the KOH preparation was negative, which suggests that the pustules are not caused by a bacterial infection. Additionally, the patient does not have any other symptoms that would suggest a bacterial infection, such as fever or chills.

C. Obtain a Tzanck smear from the pustules.

This is not the correct answer because the Tzanck smear is not a sensitive or specific test for herpes simplex virus (HSV). Additionally, the patient does not have any other symptoms that would suggest HSV infection, such as fever or blisters on other parts of the body.

D. Obtain a skin biopsy from the pustules.

This is the correct answer because a skin biopsy will provide the most definitive diagnosis of the patient's rash. The biopsy can be used to rule out other possible causes of the rash, such as lymphoma or a fungal infection. Additionally, the biopsy can be used to determine the extent of the rash and whether it is likely to spread.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D. Obtain a skin biopsy from the pustules.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including vesicular rash. The rash is typically characterized by multiple, 7- to 8-mm vesicles with erythematous bases, some with hemorrhagic crusting and others filled with clear fluid. Oropharyngeal lesions and neurologic deficits are not present. The diagnosis of HSV infection can be confirmed by rapid direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testing from a vesicle. DFA testing is a rapid and sensitive test that can detect HSV antigens in the skin. Treatment of HSV infection is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir.

Option A, administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, is incorrect because the patient does not have an infection that requires antibiotics. Option B, do nothing; the lesions will resolve spontaneously, is incorrect because HSV infection can be serious, especially in neonates. Option C, obtain a skin biopsy of a vesicle for pathologic evaluation, is incorrect because DFA testing is a more sensitive and specific test for HSV infection.

 99%|█████████▉| 1511/1525 [6:08:12<03:20, 14.32s/it]The correct answer is D. Obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications. The patient has acute bilateral angle closure, which is a medical emergency that can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. The first step in treating acute angle closure is to lower the intraocular pressure. This can be done with medications, such as pilocarpine, or with surgery, such as laser peripheral iridotomy. However, before any treatment is started, it is important to obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications. This is because some medications, such as beta-blockers, can worsen acute angle closure. Additionally, some medications, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, can be used to lower the intraocular pressure in acute angle closure. Therefore, it is important to know all of the patient's medications before starting any treatment.

A. Administering a miotic agent, such as pilocarpine, is a common treatment for acute angle closure. However, in this case, it is important to first obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications. This is because some medications, such as beta-blockers, can worsen acute angle closure. Additionally, some medications, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, can be used to lower the intraocular pressure in acute angle closure. Therefore, it is important to know all of the patient's medications before starting any treatment with a miotic agent.

B. Proceeding directly to choroidal drainage sclerotomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat acute angle closure. However, this procedure is only necessary if the intraocular pressure cannot be lowered with medications. In this case, the patient's visual acuity has improved with the use of a pinhole lens, which suggests that the intraocular pressure is not as high as it was initially. Therefore, it is reasonable to try to lower the intraocular pressure with medications before proceeding to choroidal drainage sclerotomy.

C. Performing laser peripheral iridotomy is a surgical procedure that is used to prevent future episodes of acute angle closure. However, this procedure is not necessary in this case because the patient has already had an episode of acute angle closure. The goal of treatment in this case is to lower the intraocular pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerves. Therefore, it is not necessary to perform laser peripheral iridotomy at this time.

Keratosis pilaris is a common, benign skin condition characterized by small, rough, red bumps on the upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. It is caused by a build-up of keratin, a protein that helps to protect the skin. Keratosis pilaris is not contagious and does not require treatment, but there are a number of over-the-counter and prescription medications that can help to improve the appearance of the skin.

Filiform verrucae are small, wart-like growths that can develop on the skin. They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and are most common in children and young adults. Filiform verrucae are usually harmless, but they can be unsightly. They can be treated with a variety of methods, including cryotherapy, laser therapy, and topical medications.

Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, benign skin condition that is characterized by the development of small, spiny papules on the face and scalp. It is caused by the reactivation of a latent human herpesvirus, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa is most common in children and young adults who are immunocompromised, such as those with cancer or HIV/AIDS. There is no cure for virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa, but it usually resolves on its own within a few months. Treatment may include topical medications, oral medications, or phototherapy.

Phrynoderma is a condition that is characterized by the development of rough, scaly skin on the palms and soles. It is caused by a deficiency of vitamin A. Phrynoderma is most common in children who are malnourished. Treatment involves correcting the vitamin A deficiency.

In the case presented, the patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He has been undergoing maintenance chemotherapy and has developed multiple, spiny, follicular hyperkeratotic papules on the face and to a lesser extent on the trunk and extremities. Alopecia is also noted involving the eyebrows and the eyelashes, but the scalp is spared. A punch biopsy specimen was taken, which showed abnormal maturation of anagen hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not account for the patient's clinical presentation and biopsy findings.

Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, which is a small, pear-shaped organ that stores bile. Bile is a fluid that helps the body digest fat. Acute cholecystitis is usually caused by a gallstone, which is a hard deposit that forms in the gallbladder. Symptoms of acute cholecystitis include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

A gallbladder polyp is a small growth on the lining of the gallbladder. Polyps are usually benign, or noncancerous. However, some polyps can become cancerous. Symptoms of gallbladder polyps are usually not present. However, some people with polyps may experience abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Gallbladder cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that stores bile, a fluid that helps the body digest fat. Symptoms of gallbladder cancer may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice.

Gall bladder volvulus is a condition in which the gallbladder twists on its axis. This can block the flow of bile and cause inflammation and infection. Symptoms of gallbladder volvulus include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

In the case presented, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with abdominal pain for 2 days. The pain is localized to her right abdomen, both upper and lower quadrants, with acute tenderness to palpation. She had some nausea and vomiting. Ultrasonographic findings gave concern for acute cholecystitis. A computed tomographic scan was ordered by her primary care physician after admission to the hospital.

The computed tomographic scan showed that the patient's gallbladder was twisted on its axis. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of gallbladder volvulus. The other choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

Acute cholecystitis is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than gallbladder volvulus because the patient does not have fever or jaundice. Gallbladder polyps are also a possible diagnosis, but they are usually not associated with acute abdominal pain. Gallbladder cancer is a less likely diagnosis because the patient is an elderly woman and gallbladder cancer is more common in people who are middle-aged or older.

The patient described his pain intensity as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. He also described having some nausea but no anorexia, and he experienced a single episode of emesis in the emergency department. He was afebrile, and his heart rate was 86 beats/min; blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; and body mass index, 28 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Bilateral lower abdominal and supraumbilical tenderness was present, as was lower abdominal voluntary guarding to palpation. Deep palpation of the left lower quadrant did not elicit pain over the right lower quadrant (ie, negative Rovsing sign). Internal and external rotation of the flexed right leg did not elicit pain (ie, negative obturator sign). Dorsiflexion of the right thigh against the examiner’s hand resulted in right lower quadrant pain (ie, positive psoas sign). Rectal examination was unrevealing. Levels of liver function enzymes, amylase, and bilirubin were normal, as was a complete blood cell count, except for leukocytosis of 14 000 cells/mm3. Urinalysis was unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained (Figure 1).

The CT scan shows a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with periappendiceal inflammation. This is consistent with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient is a young, healthy man with typical clinical and laboratory findings for acute appendicitis. The CT scan findings confirm the diagnosis. The treatment for acute appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy). The preferred approach is laparoscopic appendectomy, which is a minimally invasive procedure. Laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with shorter hospital stays, less pain, and faster recovery than open appendectomy.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Admitting the patient for observation is not an appropriate management option for acute appendicitis. The patient has a clear diagnosis and requires surgical treatment. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics and serial abdominal examinations is not an appropriate management option for acute appendicitis. Antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Serial abdominal examinations are not necessary to make the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound is not an appropriate management option for acute appendicitis. An abdominal ultrasound can be used to diagnose acute appendicitis, but it is not necessary in this case. The patient has a clear diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and CT scan findings.

 99%|█████████▉| 1515/1525 [6:09:05<02:13, 13.38s/it]The correct answer is B. Proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months.

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a 2- to 3-week history of herpes zoster in the left T11-T12 dermatomes. He developed a painful, progressive bulge in his left flank. The bulge was more prominent on standing, coughing, and straining. Antiviral agents were not administered when he first developed zoster because the diagnosis was established more than 72 hours after first presentation of the disease. Neither fever nor chills were reported. The patient’s medical history was notable for a 30-year history of hypertension and diabetes. Physical examination revealed a reducible protrusion in the left flank, with several red to light brown macules on the overlying skin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed convexity of the left lower abdominal wall compared with the right and did not reveal any mass, hernia, or accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

The most likely diagnosis is a zoster-associated cutaneous synkinesia (ZACS). ZACS is a rare complication of herpes zoster that occurs when the virus damages the nerves that control the muscles. This can lead to involuntary movements, muscle spasms, and pain in the affected area. The symptoms of ZACS usually resolve within a few months, but they can last for several years in some cases.

There is no specific treatment for ZACS. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing complications. Pain management may include medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids. Physical therapy can help to improve range of motion and reduce muscle spasms. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to release the tight muscles or to repair any damage to the nerves.

In the case of this patient, the most appropriate management is to proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months. This means that the patient should be monitored closely for any changes in his condition. If the symptoms of ZACS worsen or do not resolve within a few months, then further treatment may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, perform emergency laparoscopy, is incorrect because there is no evidence of an acute surgical abdomen. The CT scan showed no evidence of a mass, hernia, or accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.
* Option C, treat with oral acyclovir, is incorrect because acyclovir is not effective for the treatment of ZACS. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes zoster. However, it is not effective for treating the symptoms of ZACS.
* Option D, request a lower gastrointestinal series, is incorrect because there is no evidence of a gastrointestinal problem. The CT scan did not show any evidence of a mass, hernia, or accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

 99%|█████████▉| 1516/1525 [6:09:18<02:00, 13.44s/it]The correct answer is D. Perform flexible bronchoscopy.

A thoracotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the chest wall. It is a major surgery that is associated with significant risks, including bleeding, infection, and injury to the heart, lungs, or other organs. It is only indicated for patients who have life-threatening conditions, such as a collapsed lung or a large bleed in the chest.

Angiography is a medical procedure that involves using X-rays to view the blood vessels. It is not indicated for the management of a foreign body in the chest.

Locally exploring the mandibular wound would not be effective in removing the foreign body, as it is located in the chest.

Flexible bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into the airway. The bronchoscope has a camera and light on it, which allows the doctor to see inside the airway. The bronchoscope can also be used to remove foreign bodies, such as the one in this case.

Flexible bronchoscopy is the best option for this patient because it is a safe and effective procedure that has a low risk of complications. It is also a minimally invasive procedure, which means that the patient will have a shorter hospital stay and a quicker recovery.
It is reasoning
 99%|█████████▉| 1517/1525 [6:09:29<01:40, 12.54s/it]The correct answer is D. Photocoagulation.

The patient is a healthy 26-year-old woman with a 3-day history of increasing “lines across my vision” and a few photopsias in the right eye. She denies ocular discomfort or systemic symptoms. She has no ophthalmic or medical history and denies recent travel or abnormal exposures. Her uncorrected acuity is 20/60 OD without improvement with pinhole and 20/20 OS. Her pupils, intraocular pressure, motility, and confrontational visual fields are normal in each eye. Results of the external examination and slitlamp examination of the anterior segment of both eyes are unremarkable. Dilated examination findings of the left eye are normal. Results of the dilated examination of the right eye reveal a clear vitreous and the findings shown in Figure 1.

The findings in Figure 1 are consistent with vitreous floaters. Vitreous floaters are small, dark spots or cobweb-like strands that float in your field of vision. They are caused by clumps of protein or cells that float in the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the inside of your eye. Vitreous floaters are very common and usually harmless. However, if they suddenly appear or increase in number, it could be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a retinal tear or detachment.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a retinal tear. A retinal tear is a break in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Retinal tears can be caused by a number of things, including age, eye strain, and trauma. If a retinal tear is not treated, it can lead to a retinal detachment, which is a serious condition that can cause permanent blindness.

The treatment for a retinal tear is photocoagulation. Photocoagulation is a procedure in which a laser is used to create a small scar in the retina. The scar helps to seal the tear and prevent it from progressing to a retinal detachment. Photocoagulation is a safe and effective procedure that is usually successful in treating retinal tears.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous gel from the eye. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including retinal detachments. However, it is not the first-line treatment for retinal tears.
* Begin systemic antihelmintic therapy is used to treat parasitic infections. It is not the first-line treatment for retinal tears.
* Order urgent serum titers of IgG and IgM for Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis is used to diagnose parasitic infections. It is not the first-line treatment for retinal tears.

100%|█████████▉| 1518/1525 [6:09:41<01:27, 12.46s/it]The most likely diagnosis is Rickettsialpox, a tick-borne disease caused by the Rickettsia akari bacterium. It is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, headache, and a characteristic rash. The rash typically begins on the palms and soles and then spreads to other parts of the body. It is made up of small, red papules that may become confluent and form larger lesions. The rash is often accompanied by itching and may be painful. Rickettsialpox is typically a self-limited disease, but it can be serious in some cases, especially in young children and people with underlying medical conditions. Treatment is with antibiotics.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Disseminated herpes simplex is a viral infection that can cause a rash in the skin. However, the rash in disseminated herpes simplex is typically more widespread than the rash in Rickettsialpox. Additionally, disseminated herpes simplex is often accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, and mouth ulcers.
* Primary varicella is a viral infection that causes chickenpox. The rash in chickenpox is typically more widespread than the rash in Rickettsialpox. Additionally, the rash in chickenpox is often accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, headache, and muscle aches.
* Staphylococcal pustulosis is a bacterial infection of the skin that can cause a rash of pustules. However, the rash in Staphylococcal pustulosis is typically more localized than the rash in Rickettsialpox. Additionally, the rash in Staphylococcal pustulosis is often accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, chills, and fatigue.

100%|█████████▉| 1519/1525 [6:09:58<01:21, 13.64s/it]The correct answer is C: Cholecystocolonic fistula.

A perforated bowel is a hole in the wall of the intestine. This can be caused by a number of things, including infection, inflammation, and trauma. Symptoms of a perforated bowel include abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. Treatment for a perforated bowel usually involves surgery to repair the hole.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of Crohn disease include abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. Treatment for Crohn disease usually involves a combination of medication and surgery.

A gallstone ileus is a blockage of the small intestine caused by a gallstone. Gallstones are hard deposits that form in the gallbladder. Symptoms of a gallstone ileus include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Treatment for a gallstone ileus usually involves surgery to remove the gallstone and the blockage.

In the case of the 64-year-old woman, the most likely diagnosis is cholecystocolonic fistula. This is because she has a history of cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which can lead to the formation of a fistula between the gallbladder and the colon. The fistula allows bile and bacteria from the gallbladder to leak into the colon, which can cause infection and inflammation. The patient's symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain, and nausea, are consistent with a cholecystocolonic fistula. The CT scan shows a fistulous tract between the gallbladder and the colon, which provides further evidence of the diagnosis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. A perforated bowel would likely cause more severe symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, shock, and peritonitis. Crohn disease would also cause more widespread symptoms, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. A gallstone ileus would likely cause more abdominal pain and constipation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cholecystocolonic fistula.
It is reasoning
100%|█████████▉| 1520/1525 [6:10:15<01:13, 14.63s/it]The correct diagnosis is A. Exophytic solitary giant cavernous hemangioma of stomach.

A cavernous hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels that is made up of large, empty spaces called caverns. It is the most common type of hemangioma and can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the skin. Stomach hemangiomas are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all gastric tumors. They are more common in women than men and typically occur in people over the age of 50.

The symptoms of a stomach hemangioma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people may have no symptoms, while others may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. In rare cases, a stomach hemangioma can bleed or rupture, which can be life-threatening.

The diagnosis of a stomach hemangioma is made with a combination of imaging tests, such as abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of a stomach hemangioma depends on the size, location, and symptoms of the tumor. Small, asymptomatic tumors may be managed with close observation. Larger tumors or those that are causing symptoms may be treated with surgery, embolization, or radiation therapy.

The prognosis for people with stomach hemangiomas is generally good. With appropriate treatment, most people are able to live long and healthy lives.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Complicated cyst: A complicated cyst is a cyst that is filled with pus or blood. It is not a common cause of a progressively enlarging mass and abdominal distention.
* C. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): A GIST is a type of tumor that can grow in the stomach or other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. It is not a common cause of a progressively enlarging mass and abdominal distention.
* D. Neurilemmoma: A neurilemmoma is a type of nerve tumor that can grow anywhere in the body. It is not a common cause of a progressively enlarging mass and abdominal distention.
It is reasoning
100%|█████████▉| 1521/1525 [6:10:27<00:55, 13.82s/it]The correct answer is D. Recommend esophageal resection.

The patient has a 3-year history of postprandial chest pain and odynophagia, with a severe exacerbation of symptoms over 2 months and a weight loss of 8.1 kg. His history includes lumbar spine surgery and chronic back pain leading to continued requirement for opiate analgesia. Endoscopy revealed food stasis throughout the esophagus, large diverticula in the lower esophagus, no resistance at the lower esophageal sphincter, and extensive candidiasis. A barium swallow was diagnostic (Figure 1). Esophageal manometry demonstrated 100% hypertensive propagated pressure waves in the distal esophagus, with a mean esophageal pressure of 335 mm Hg, a maximum pressure of 701 mm Hg, and normal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The patient was treated with antifungal therapy and received a 1-month course of calcium channel antagonists, but symptoms were unchanged and weight loss progressed.

The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with achalasia, a rare esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and aperistalsis of the esophageal body. Achalasia is typically treated with pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy. However, in patients with severe disease or complications, esophageal resection may be necessary.

The benefits of esophageal resection in patients with achalasia include relief of symptoms, improvement in quality of life, and decreased risk of esophageal cancer. The risks of esophageal resection include perioperative mortality, morbidity, and long-term complications such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and stricture.

In the case presented, the patient has failed medical therapy and has a severe achalasia with complications, including food stasis, weight loss, and esophageal diverticula. Therefore, esophageal resection is the most appropriate treatment option.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (treat with analgesia and nutritional support) is not a definitive treatment for achalasia and would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.
* Option B (treat with calcium channel antagonists) is a medical treatment for achalasia, but it is not effective in all patients and may not be appropriate for patients with severe disease.
* Option C (recommend an extended esophageal myotomy) is a surgical treatment for achalasia, but it is not appropriate for patients with severe disease or complications.
It is reasoning
100%|█████████▉| 1522/1525 [6:10:40<00:41, 13.77s/it]The correct answer is C: Immunohistochemical testing.

Acid-fast staining is used to detect the presence of acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This is not the likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient has no history of tuberculosis and the lesions are not in a typical distribution for tuberculosis.

Immunoelectron microscopy is used to study the ultrastructure of cells and tissues. This is not the best test to diagnose the patient's condition, as it is not specific for any particular disease.

PAS (periodic acid–Schiff) staining is a histochemical stain that is used to detect the presence of carbohydrates. This is not the best test to diagnose the patient's condition, as it is not specific for any particular disease.

Immunohistochemical testing is the best test to diagnose the patient's condition, as it can be used to identify specific antigens in the patient's tissue. In this case, immunohistochemical testing would likely show the presence of CD68, a marker of macrophages. This would support the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a rare condition in which Langerhans cells, a type of macrophage, accumulate in the skin and other tissues.

The other choices are incorrect because they are not specific for Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
It is reasoning
100%|█████████▉| 1523/1525 [6:10:56<00:29, 14.50s/it]The correct answer is C. Hepatic abscess.

A hydatid cyst is a parasitic cyst caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It is most common in sheep-raising areas of the world, such as the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia, and South America. The patient in this case does not have a history of travel to these areas, and there is no evidence of hydatid cysts on imaging studies.

An infected biliary cystadenoma is a rare tumor of the liver that can become infected. It is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people over the age of 50. The patient in this case is a young man, and there is no evidence of a tumor on imaging studies.

An inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is a rare condition that can mimic a tumor. It is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people over the age of 40. The patient in this case is a young man, and there is no evidence of a tumor on imaging studies.

Hepatic abscess is a collection of pus in the liver. It can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including E. coli, Streptococcus, and Salmonella. The patient in this case has a history of pharyngitis associated with scarlet fever, which is a bacterial infection. The patient also has a fever, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting. These are all symptoms of hepatic abscess. Imaging studies show a hypodense, multiloculated lesion in the liver. This is consistent with a hepatic abscess.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hepatic abscess.

100%|█████████▉| 1524/1525 [6:11:13<00:15, 15.09s/it]The correct answer is C. Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with multiple brown tumors.

A malignant bone tumor is an aggressive tumor that can spread to other parts of the body. The patient in this case did not have any symptoms or signs of a malignant tumor, such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. The lesions on the radiograph and MRI were also not consistent with a malignant tumor.

An aneurysmal bone cyst is a benign tumor that is filled with blood. The patient in this case did not have any symptoms or signs of an aneurysmal bone cyst, such as pain, swelling, or a mass. The lesions on the radiograph and MRI were also not consistent with an aneurysmal bone cyst.

Giant cell tumor is a benign tumor that is made up of giant cells. The patient in this case did have symptoms and signs of a giant cell tumor, such as pain and swelling. However, the lesions on the radiograph and MRI were not consistent with a giant cell tumor.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a hormone that helps to regulate the level of calcium in the blood. When PTH levels are high, calcium levels in the blood can become too high. This can lead to a number of problems, including bone loss, kidney stones, and fatigue.

Multiple brown tumors are a type of bone lesion that can occur in people with pHPT. These lesions are caused by the increased levels of PTH. They are typically found in the bones of the hands, feet, and skull.

The patient in this case had a number of features that are consistent with pHPT. These include:

* A history of pain in the right knee
* A radiograph and MRI that showed osteolytic lesions in the distal femur and the head of the tibia
* Laboratory test results that showed a high level of calcium in the blood
* A biopsy that showed spindle cell infiltrates with hemorrhages, fragmented trabecular bone, and numerous osteoclastic giant cells proliferating at a rate of 10%
* A flourodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan that showed additional lesions in the left distal femur and the left mandible

Based on all of this information, the most likely diagnosis is pHPT with multiple brown tumors.
