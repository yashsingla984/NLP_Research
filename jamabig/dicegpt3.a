B: Arrange endoscopy

Explanation: The presence of coin-shaped opacities in the stomach on the chest radiograph indicates that the patient may have swallowed metallic objects. To further evaluate this and ensure the objects are not causing any obstruction or perforation, an endoscopy should be arranged. This will allow for direct visualization of the stomach and potential removal of the objects if necessary. Administration of activated charcoal or performing gastric lavage is not appropriate in this case as there is no evidence of an acute ingestion of a toxic substance or foreign body. Supportive care should be provided regardless, but arranging endoscopy is the next appropriate step.

The correct answer is D: Mediastinitis.

Explanation:
Mediastinitis is the inflammation of the mediastinum, the space in the middle of the chest between the lungs. It is usually caused by an infection following esophageal perforation, which can occur during foreign body removal. In this case, the CT scan shows gas accumulation in the left lobe of the thyroid gland, indicating the spread of infection. The persistent postoperative fevers and elevated leukocyte count further support the diagnosis of mediastinitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with intravenous antibiotics and possible surgical intervention are essential to prevent complications such as abscess formation and sepsis.
