B: Arrange endoscopy.

Explanation: Given the presence of radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the patient's stomach on the chest radiograph, the next appropriate step would be to arrange endoscopy. This will allow for direct visualization of the stomach and potential removal of any foreign bodies if present. Options such as administering activated charcoal or performing gastric lavage may be considered if ingestion of a foreign body is confirmed, but endoscopy is the initial procedure of choice to assess and manage the situation. Supportive care should also be provided as needed.

The correct answer is D: Mediastinitis.

Explanation: The patient's persistent fevers and the presence of gas in the left lobe of the thyroid gland on CT scan are suggestive of esophageal perforation with subsequent mediastinitis. The elevated leukocyte count also supports an infectious process. Parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscesses would typically present with more severe symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, voice change, and neck swelling. Emphysematous thyroiditis is a rare condition characterized by infection and gas formation within the thyroid gland, but it typically occurs in the setting of diabetes and is associated with severe systemic illness.

My diagnosis is A: Herpes simplex virus.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of acute-onset painful umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders is consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The Tzanck smear, which shows ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, further supports this diagnosis. HSV causes characteristic cytopathic changes in infected cells, including multinucleation and nuclear molding, which are seen in the Tzanck smear. Histoplasmosis, molluscum contagiosum, and Mpox would not typically present with these specific clinical and microscopic findings.

A: Perform a bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The presence of peripheral blasts, along with significant anemia and thrombocytopenia, suggests the possibility of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or another myeloid neoplasm. Performing a bone marrow biopsy will help confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of bone marrow involvement. This information is necessary for appropriate management and treatment decisions.

3
The diagnosis is D: Sphenoid wing meningioma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of facial numbness, weakness, vision changes, and headaches are consistent with cranial neuropathy. The presence of right-sided ptosis, severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern, and a fixed and dilated right pupil suggest involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, indicating a lesion in the vicinity of the cavernous sinus. The restricted and painful right extraocular movements further support this. Additionally, the right-sided facial sensation diminished in all cranial nerve V distributions indicates involvement of the trigeminal nerve.

The initial MRI may be unremarkable, as seen in this case, as meningiomas can be isointense on T1-weighted images. A biopsy of cranial nerve VII was nondiagnostic, but it is known that meningiomas can infiltrate nerve sheaths and present as cranial neuropathies. The mildly elevated protein levels in the CSF may be due to the mass effect of the meningioma.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia due to granulomatous inflammation involving the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure. Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy would typically present with enlargement of multiple cranial nerves and involve the meninges. Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma typically presents with diffuse neurological symptoms, such as headache, mental status changes, and cranial nerve palsies.

My diagnosis is D: Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, hypereosinophilia, and elevated vitamin B12 levels is consistent with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. These neoplasms are characterized by abnormal fusion genes resulting in dysregulated tyrosine kinase activation, leading to increased proliferation and survival of cells. The presence of dysplastic eosinophils and a blast count of 2% on bone marrow biopsy, along with the immunohistochemical staining and molecular studies (interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization for FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement), support the diagnosis. Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the specific tyrosine kinase fusion gene involved.

B: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease

Explanation:
Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare and benign condition characterized by tender lymphadenopathy, fever, and sometimes skin rash. It most commonly affects young women and is often self-limited. The diagnosis is made through a biopsy showing coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris in the lymph nodes, along with histiocytes and dendritic cells. There is no specific treatment for Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, as it typically resolves on its own within a few weeks to months.
B

B: Electrophysiology study.

Explanation: An electrophysiology study (EPS) is recommended in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) to identify the underlying cause, localize the site of origin, and provide information for subsequent management. In this case, the patient had monomorphic VT with a morphology suggesting right ventricular origin, making an EPS necessary to further evaluate the arrhythmia and guide treatment options. It will also help in assessing the need for implantation of cardiac defibrillator, which may be a potential option in this elderly patient with severe RV and LV systolic dysfunction.

7
The correct answer is A: Arteriovenous malformation of the scalp.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, along with the imaging findings and angiography results, are consistent with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the scalp. AVMs are abnormal tangles of blood vessels that bypass the capillary network, resulting in high-pressure blood flow from arteries directly into veins. In this case, the scalp lesion is ill-defined, spongy, and pulsatile, which are typical characteristics of an AVM. The MRI shows intense enhancement and vascularity, without involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The angiography confirms the hypervascular mass supplied by hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries. The biopsy results showing an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity are consistent with an AVM as well.

Solitary fibrous tumor (B) typically presents as a well-circumscribed mass, and it does not show the intense vascularity seen in this case. diffuse-type neurofibroma (C) is unlikely because it typically presents as a diffusely infiltrating mass, and it does not demonstrate the extensive vascularity seen here. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (D) is unlikely because it typically presents as a locally aggressive cutaneous tumor, and it does not exhibit the intense vascularity demonstrated in this case.
C
8
Based on the description and the histopathologic findings of infiltrate of foamy histiocytes and pigmented yeasts without multiaxial septation, the correct diagnosis is D: Phaeohyphomycosis.

Explanation: Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi, which are fungi that produce darkly pigmented hyphae. The characteristic histopathologic findings of pigmented yeasts without multiaxial septation are consistent with this diagnosis. Phaeohyphomycosis typically presents as chronic cutaneous or subcutaneous infections with slow progression, which can lead to destruction of surrounding tissues. In this case, the patient presented with erythematous scaly plaques on the face and extremities, along with palatal perforation and destruction of ear cartilage.

Chromoblastomycosis (A) is also a fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi, but it typically presents with verrucous plaques and, histopathologically, shows muriform (sclerotic) bodies. Hyalohyphomycosis (B) is a term used to describe infections caused by nonpigmented hyaline fungi and does not match the clinical and histopathologic findings described in this case. Blastomycosis (C) is a systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces species and typically presents with pulmonary symptoms, which were not reported in this case.

9
The answer is C: Acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss, along with the findings on imaging of mastoiditis with erosion into the sigmoid sinus, is consistent with acute coalescent mastoiditis. The histologic findings of syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications are not seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis or meningioma. Cholesteatoma typically presents with retraction pockets or effusion on otoscopic examination, which was not seen in this case.
B
10
B: Tuberculosis

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with a midline sore throat, cobbling and adherent yellow mucus on the uvula, along with the presence of suppurative granulomatous inflammation on the pathology results, suggests a chronic infectious process. The negative laboratory results for streptococcus, COVID-19, and mononucleosis rule out these common causes of sore throat. Additionally, the failed response to multiple rounds of antibiotics and antifungals suggests an atypical or resistant infection.

The patient's history of travel to Guyana, where tuberculosis is endemic, and the previous presentation of neck subcutaneous nodules with dense granulomatous inflammation that resolved spontaneously, further support the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Leishmaniasis and leprosy are tropical diseases but do not typically cause symptoms in the upper respiratory tract. Lethal midline granuloma is a rare aggressive form of lymphoma, but the biopsy results did not show evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Therefore, tuberculosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.
A
11
D: Oral involvement of mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa is consistent with oral involvement of mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the skin, but can also involve the oral mucosa. The patient's history of mycosis fungoides and skin findings support this diagnosis. Other options such as Laugier-Hunziker syndrome, melanoma, and medication adverse effect are less likely based on the clinical presentation and patient history.

B: Peripheral blood smear

Explanation: Given the patient's history of immigration from Nigeria, the symptoms of movement in the eye and swelling in the face and hand, and the elevated eosinophil count, it is important to consider the possibility of parasitic infection, specifically onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness), which is caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus. An important diagnostic test for onchocerciasis is a peripheral blood smear, which can detect microfilariae (the larval form of the parasite) in the blood.

I would choose option C: Observe with no additional testing or intervention.

Explanation: The pigmented iris lesion in this case is most likely a cyst based on the findings from anterior segment optical coherence tomography and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Since the lesion is asymptomatic and there are no concerning features such as corneal guttatae or edema, it would be reasonable to monitor the lesion without any further testing or intervention. Regular follow-up visits can be scheduled to evaluate any changes in size or appearance of the lesion over time. If there are any concerning changes or symptoms develop, further intervention can be considered. However, at this point, conservative management with observation is the most appropriate course of action.

A: Pretibial myxedema

Explanation:
The patient's history of long-standing thickening and induration of the legs, along with the multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, is consistent with pretibial myxedema. Pretibial myxedema is a manifestation of Graves' disease, an autoimmune thyroid disorder. It is characterized by the deposition of abnormal dermal glycosaminoglycans, leading to localized thickening and induration of the skin.

Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa refers to a chronic lymphedema resulting from factors other than parasitic infections, which presents with skin changes including hyperkeratosis, verrucous papules, and nodules. While this patient has a prior diagnosis of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, the current presentation is not consistent with the typical features of the condition.

Lobomycosis is a chronic fungal infection characterized by the development of nodular or keloidal lesions on the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It typically occurs in individuals residing in tropical areas and is caused by the fungus Lacazia loboi. The clinical presentation and patient history do not support a diagnosis of lobomycosis in this case.

Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis is a rare localized form of myxedema that can occur in the absence of thyroid dysfunction. While the presentation overlaps with pretibial myxedema, this patient has a history of thyroid disease (Graves' disease) and therefore a diagnosis of euthyroid pretibial mucinosis is less likely.

B: Familial cerebral cavernous malformations

Explanation: The patient's clinical history and presentation, including the presence of multiple bluish papules and nodules on the lower legs, a history of bleeding after trauma, a lipolymphedema, and a family history of cerebral venous malformations, suggest a diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformations. The detection of a heterozygous pathogenic KRIT1 variant through mutational analysis further supports this diagnosis. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, glomuvenous malformations, and verrucous venous malformations do not match the patient's clinical features and family history.

B: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy

Explanation: The next step in this case would be to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the amelanotic fundus lesion to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis. This will help confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the lesion, potentially ruling out choroidal melanoma and guiding further management decisions.

17
The correct answer is D: Lichen amyloidosis (LA).

Explanation: Lichen amyloidosis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the presence of multiple pruritic papules and plaques, often localized to the lower legs. The papules and plaques are usually erythematous to violaceous and can become lichenified. On close inspection, milia (small white cysts) and erosions with partially detached epidermis can be seen. Lichen amyloidosis typically does not involve the mucous membranes or other body sites.

Histopathologic examination reveals dermoepidermal separation and deposition of amyloid in the papillary dermis. This deposition of amyloid is responsible for the clinical presentation and chronicity of the disease.

Pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD) is a similar condition but typically occurs in patients with chronic stasis dermatitis and venous insufficiency. It is characterized by pruritic papules and plaques on the lower legs.

Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) is a variant of lichen planus and presents with thickened, hyperpigmented plaques that are usually intensely pruritic. It commonly affects the shins.

Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) is a rare subtype of epidermolysis bullosa characterized by intensely pruritic papules and nodules on the extremities. It is associated with mutations in the COL17A1 gene.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is lichen amyloidosis due to the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

I would choose option B: Order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis.

Explanation: The history and examination findings suggest a possible infectious etiology for the patient's symptoms. The bilateral sectorial macular star, optic disc edema, and other retinal findings are consistent with neuroretinitis, which can occur in response to various infections. Therefore, ordering serologic testing for infectious causes, such as Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch disease) or other viral or bacterial infections, would help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

19
The answer is D: Teratoma.

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the mass is a congenital tongue mass with a firm texture. The MRI findings of a uniformly solid and well-circumscribed mass without cystic components or flow voids, along with its size remaining proportional with somatic growth, suggest a teratoma. Teratomas are germ cell tumors that can contain a variety of tissues, including muscle, connective tissue, and even teeth or hair. Hemangiomas are more commonly present at birth and typically have a different appearance on MRI. Rhabdomyomas are rare tumors of smooth muscle origin and are usually not observed in the tongue. Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant tumors that would typically present with more alarming clinical findings, such as cervical lymphadenopathy or additional masses.
B
20
I would choose option A: Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of poor wound healing, rash, and delayed healing after a previous surgery suggests a potential underlying immune disorder or infection. Since the bacterial culture was negative and the skin findings did not improve with antibiotics, it is important to obtain a skin biopsy to further evaluate the cause of the rash and delayed wound healing. This can help determine if there is an underlying inflammatory or infectious process that needs to be addressed.

21
My diagnosis based on the given information is C: Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum.

Explanation: Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare cutaneous manifestation of infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The patient's history of multiple myeloma and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia puts her at increased risk for infections. The presence of necrotic skin lesions, severe neutropenia, and a nonproductive cough are consistent with Pseudomonas infection. The dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules with overlying eschar seen on physical examination are typical of ecthyma gangrenosum. The skin biopsy and tissue culture, showing septated hyphae and oval microconidia, are not consistent with fungal infections such as invasive aspergillosis or disseminated fusariosis. Sweet syndrome is characterized by tender, erythematous papules and plaques, which is different from the dusky papulonodules with overlying eschar seen in this patient.

A: Radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma

Explanation: The patient's history of radiotherapy as a treatment for primary salivary duct carcinoma and the rapid progression of the lesion, along with the presence of multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules, are characteristic of radiotherapy-induced angiosarcoma. This is a rare, aggressive cutaneous malignancy that can occur in the radiation field after a latency period. It typically presents as violaceous plaques or nodules with a hemorrhagic or purpuric appearance. Kaposi sarcoma, acquired angiokeratomas, and carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides do not match the clinical presentation or history in this case.

23
Based on the information provided, the correct diagnosis is C: Bullous pilomatricoma.

Explanation:
Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare variant of pilomatricoma, a benign skin tumor derived from hair matrix cells. It typically presents as a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. The tumor often enlarges slowly over time. There is usually no history of trauma or insect bite.

On physical examination, the tumor appears as a protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike lesion on the skin surface. Inside the tumor, a firm-to-hard nodule can be palpated. Regional lymphadenopathy is usually absent.

Histological examination reveals basophilic cells and shadow cells, as well as dilated lymphatic vessels. The absence of any atypical features or infiltrative growth patterns confirms the benign nature of the tumor.

Treatment involves complete excision of the tumor, which is usually curative with no risk of recurrence or metastasis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Bullous pilomatricoma.

B: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging to look for associated central nervous system tumors

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the presence of a retinal lesion associated with vascular abnormalities, skin findings consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and the growth on her cheek, suggests a diagnosis of TSC. TSC is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in various organs, including the brain. It is important to evaluate for the presence of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, such as cortical tubers or subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, as their presence may inform treatment decisions and prognosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for assessing CNS involvement in TSC. Therefore, ordering a brain MRI is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.
B

25
B: Check an antisynthetase antibody panel

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including dysphagia, pulmonary symptoms, and dermatologic findings, raises suspicion for an underlying autoimmune condition. The positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) result further supports this possibility. Antisynthetase syndrome is a subset of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies characterized by the presence of specific antibodies, such as anti-Jo-1 antibodies, which can cause interstitial lung disease, myositis, and skin involvement. Checking an antisynthetase antibody panel can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Percutaneous lung tissue biopsy and quadriceps muscle biopsy may be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty or for further evaluation, but checking the antibody panel is a more reasonable initial step. Prescribing prednisone without confirmation of the diagnosis is not ideal and may not adequately address the underlying autoimmune condition.

26
The correct answer is D: Schwannoma. 

Explanation: A schwannoma is a benign neoplasm that arises from Schwann cells, which are responsible for the formation of the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves. The typical presentation includes a slow-growing mass that compresses nearby structures, resulting in symptoms such as dysphagia and dyspnea. The physical examination findings of fullness in the oropharynx and neck level 3 suggest involvement of the left pharyngeal plexus. The flexible laryngoscopy findings of a submucosal mass in the left oropharynx extending inferiorly into the hypopharynx further support this diagnosis. CT imaging with contrast demonstrates the characteristic features of a schwannoma, including a well-circumscribed heterogeneous mass with clear planes separating it from adjacent structures. Choose answer option D.
C
27
C: Order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin 

Explanation: The patient's presentation, which includes bilateral mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia, and new-onset unsteady gait, is consistent with Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). MFS is a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. In MFS, the anti-GQ1b antibody is often positive. IVIG is the recommended treatment for MFS, and early initiation has been shown to improve outcomes. Therefore, ordering the anti-GQ1b antibody test and starting IVIG is the appropriate next step in management.

28
The correct answer is D: Merkel cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing, necrotic, ulcerated mass, along with a punch biopsy showing highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells extending into the subcutaneous tissue, is consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry demonstrating SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells further supports this diagnosis. The intense hypermetabolic activity on positron emission tomography and computed tomography scan, as well as the presence of enlarged axillary lymph nodes, suggests local spread and lymph node involvement commonly seen in Merkel cell carcinoma. The negative brain magnetic resonance imaging rules out intracranial metastasis. Squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma can have overlapping clinical and histologic features but are less likely based on the provided information.

A: Vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime

Explanation: Based on the presentation of vitritis and vasculitis, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. This would allow for targeted treatment of any potential infectious cause of the retinal vasculitis, such as viral or bacterial infections. The vitreous tap could also provide diagnostic information regarding the underlying etiology of the inflammation.

A: Obtain MRI of the left shoulder

Explanation: Given the patient's history of left shoulder pain, stiffness, reduced range of motion, and radiographic evidence of absence of the left humeral head, obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder would provide more detailed information about the extent of the injury and help with further evaluation and treatment planning. MRI can assess soft tissue structures, such as ligaments and tendons, and provide better visualization of the joint and surrounding structures. It can help identify any underlying pathology or causes for the complete destruction of the proximal humeral head.

31
C: Percutaneous coronary intervention

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and evidence of myocardial injury with elevated troponin levels, along with angiographic evidence of left main spontaneous coronary artery dissection, the appropriate next step would be percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI involves the use of a catheter to open up the blocked or narrowed coronary artery, restoring blood flow to the heart. In this case, it is crucial to promptly restore blood flow to the left main coronary artery to prevent further myocardial damage and potential complications.

B: VEXAS syndrome

Explanation: VEXAS syndrome is a newly recognized autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent fever, lung inflammation, vasculitis, and various hematologic and cutaneous abnormalities. It typically affects middle-aged or older men and is associated with a high mortality rate. The clinical features of this patient, including the chronic annular plaques, low-grade fevers, leukopenia, and negative antinuclear antibody screening results, are consistent with VEXAS syndrome. The lack of response to traditional treatments for subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus further supports this diagnosis. Additional diagnostic criteria for VEXAS syndrome include evidence of clonal hematopoiesis (identified by DNA sequencing) and the absence of other reasonable explanations for the clinical presentation.

33
The correct answer is: C: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive skin laxity, yellowish papules, and excessive calcification of elastic fiber fragments in the skin biopsy are consistent with a diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)-like disorder. However, the presence of a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time suggests a coagulation deficiency, which distinguishes this case from typical PXE. The presence of skin laxity in the patient's younger sister also suggests an inherited condition. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency.

34
Answer: A: Check stool for Echinococcus granulosus eggs

Explanation: Given the patient's history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, as well as the presence of pulmonary and liver cysts, the most likely diagnosis is cystic echinococcosis (CE), which is caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosus. To confirm the diagnosis, checking the stool for E. granulosus eggs should be the next step. CE is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and serologic tests. Imaging findings alone are not sufficient for diagnosis, and a lung or liver biopsy may carry unnecessary risks. Serologic testing for E. granulosus antibodies can be considered if the stool examination is inconclusive.

35
C: Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the annular skin lesions, nerve involvement, and skin biopsy findings suggestive of granulomatous dermatitis, are consistent with a possible diagnosis of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. To confirm the diagnosis, it is important to send a skin biopsy specimen to a specialized laboratory, such as the US National Hansen's Disease Program, for PCR testing. This testing helps to detect the presence of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacteria responsible for leprosy. The other options, such as obtaining serologic testing or treating with anti-leprosy medications, may be considered later based on the results of the PCR testing.

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to choose option D: Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including weight loss, cardiomegaly, cardiac hypertrophy, and peripheral neuropathy, are suggestive of a systemic disorder. The increased cardiac uptake on the bone scintigraphy scan further indicates a possible infiltrative cardiac disease. Monoclonal gammopathy should be considered in this patient, as it can present with these findings. 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins, specifically monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones proteins), can help confirm the diagnosis. This testing will assess for the presence of abnormal proteins in the urine, which may indicate a monoclonal gammopathy. Further evaluation and management can be guided by the results of this test.

37
I would choose answer option D: Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography.

Explanation: Choroidal detachment is a condition where fluid accumulates between the choroid (a layer of the eye) and the sclera (the white part of the eye). It can be caused by various factors, including trauma or certain eye surgeries. In this case, the patient did not have a history of trauma, so there might be an underlying cause that needs to be investigated.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography can help in identifying any underlying pathology that may be contributing to the choroidal detachment. These imaging techniques can provide detailed information about the eye and its blood vessels, helping to rule out any vascular abnormalities or other potential causes.

Therefore, conducting an MRI with angiography would be the appropriate next step in evaluating this patient's condition and determining the underlying cause of the choroidal detachment.

38
I would choose option D: Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery.

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation of unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber, signs of anterior uveitis, posterior synechiae, and an inferior retinal detachment, it is likely that the patient has developed acute angle-closure glaucoma with associated uveitis and retinal detachment. These findings suggest a complex and potentially sight-threatening condition that would benefit from surgical intervention.

Phacoemulsification alone may not be sufficient to address the underlying causes and complications of this case. Combining phacoemulsification with vitrectomy surgery allows for the comprehensive management of the anterior segment pathology, including the removal of any inflammatory debris, release of posterior synechiae, and restoration of proper fluid dynamics.

The management of the underlying uveitis would typically involve the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. However, in this case, the severity of the presentation and the presence of a retinal detachment indicate a need for surgical intervention rather than relying solely on medical management.

Option A (perform peripheral iridotomy) may be considered if the patient had angle-closure glaucoma without associated uveitis or retinal detachment. However, the presence of these additional findings suggests a more complex pathology that requires a more comprehensive approach.

Option B (perform full-thickness sclerectomy) is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence to suggest that increased intraocular pressure is the primary cause of the deepening of the anterior chamber or the associated findings.

Option C (administer intravenous corticosteroids) may be appropriate for managing uveitis, but it does not address the underlying causes and complications of this case.

Therefore, scheduling combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery is the most appropriate course of action to address all aspects of this complex presentation.

B: Pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells

Explanation: Given the patient's history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the findings of panuveitis, diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss, and late staining of retinal lesions, it is important to evaluate for possible leukemic involvement in the eye. Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy and chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry can help assess for the presence of leukemic cells. This will provide valuable information for diagnosis and guide further management. Immunomodulatory therapy with another course of oral steroids may help, but it is important to investigate the underlying cause of the visual symptoms first. Intravitreal steroid injection may not be sufficient in this case. Observation alone is not recommended given the progressive visual decline and significant findings on examination.

The diagnosis is C: Pleomorphic adenoma.

Explanation: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common type of benign salivary gland tumor and can occur in various locations, including the parapharyngeal space (PPS). The patient's symptoms of left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort are consistent with the mass in the PPS compressing surrounding structures. The MRI findings of a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass that is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with gadolinium administration are also characteristic of pleomorphic adenoma. The histopathologic evaluation confirming a well-circumscribed mass further supports this diagnosis. Schwannoma, venous malformation, and paraganglioma are other differential diagnoses for PPS masses, but the given clinical presentation and imaging findings are more consistent with pleomorphic adenoma in this case.
B
41
The correct answer is C: Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) with perineural spread.

Explanation:
The imaging findings described in the case report, including mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses on MRI, bony destruction with remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses on CT, and enhancing soft tissue in the retroantral spaces and pterygopalatine fossae, are all consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis, specifically mucormycosis.

The perineural spread of disease is also evident, with involvement of the left facial nerve, mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, and spreading up to the left foramen ovale. The stylomastoid foramen widening and subtle enhancement along its mastoid and tympanic segments further support the diagnosis of perineural extension.

The patient's history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and the absence of neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions on MRI make it less likely for the symptoms to be related to metastasis.

Schwannoma is a benign tumor arising from Schwann cells and typically does not show bony destruction or perineural spread.

Maxillary carcinoma, while it can invade nearby structures, typically presents with symptoms related to the primary lesion and may not involve perineural spread.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings and clinical presentation is invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) with perineural spread (Choice C).

The correct answer is D: Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma).

Explanation: Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in a solitary organ or tissue without systemic involvement. In this case, the clinical presentation of a firm and nodular lesion on the midline dorsal tongue, along with the histologic findings of acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules, are consistent with localized amyloidosis. The presence of normal overlying epithelium further supports this diagnosis.

Fibroma is a benign fibrous tumor that typically presents as a well-circumscribed, firm, and sessile or pedunculated lesion. Granular cell tumor is a tumor composed of large polygonal cells with granular cytoplasm. Median rhomboid glossitis is a chronic and asymptomatic flat or atrophic lesion at the midline of the dorsal tongue, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation in this case.
D
43
B: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm

Explanation: The patient's presentation of violaceous plaques on the scalp, along with the findings of nontender violaceous plaques on the forehead and scalp, as well as nonspecific skin-colored plaques on the chest, raises suspicion for a hematologic malignancy with cutaneous involvement. The punch biopsy of the erythematous plaque on the left lower back revealed a cellular infiltrate of basophilic blastoid cells, which is characteristic of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (formerly known as blastic NK cell leukemia/lymphoma). This aggressive hematopoietic malignancy is often associated with cutaneous involvement and can present with ecchymotic plaques. The peripheral blood findings of anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia further support the diagnosis. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma would typically present with an isolated cutaneous lesion rather than widespread plaques. Epithelioid angiosarcoma would manifest as a rapidly growing, nodular lesion rather than plaques. Myeloid leukemia cutis would present with skin infiltrates characterized by myeloblasts, rather than blastoid cells seen here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings is blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.

I cannot provide a diagnosis without further information or evaluation of the patient. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional or dermatologist for a proper diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic tests.
B: Atherosclerotic disease.

Explanation: The child's clinical presentation, including headache, seizures, altered consciousness, and hypertension, is consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of bilateral white matter hyperintensity, particularly in the parieto-occipital region, further support this diagnosis.

The abdominal examination findings of an abdominal bruit, along with the ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) findings, suggest renovascular hypertension. The CTA shows a short segment and circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing, indicating atherosclerotic disease.

Moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, and Takayasu arteritis are less likely in this case as they typically present with different clinical and imaging findings.

46
B: Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies

Explanation: Considering the presentation of the patient with generalized and coalescing salmon-colored plaques, waxy, exfoliative scale on the palms and soles, and ectropion, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies. This would help determine if there is an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). T-cell clonality studies can assess for the presence of clonal T cells, which would support the diagnosis of CTCL. other options like ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel, testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody, or testing for HLA-B27 are not indicated based on the information given in the case.
B

47
C: Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

Explanation: The black discoloration seen on the dorsal surface of the patient's tongue is consistent with Black Hairy Tongue (BHT). BHT is a harmless and benign condition characterized by the elongation and pigmentation of the filiform papillae on the tongue. It is often associated with poor oral hygiene, smoking, antibiotic use, and certain medications. In this case, the patient's symptoms developed after starting intravenous cefazolin therapy.

The first-line management for BHT is reassurance and improving oral hygiene. This includes brushing the tongue gently with a soft toothbrush or tongue scraper and maintaining good oral hygiene practices. No further investigations or interventions are necessary unless the symptoms persist or worsen. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to provide reassurance to the patient and prescribe oral care.

48
B: Dermoid cyst

Explanation: The gross and histologic examination findings are consistent with a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are benign cystic lesions that contain ectodermal and mesodermal tissues. They often present as painless masses and can be found in various locations, including the head and neck region. Histologically, dermoid cysts are lined with keratinizing squamous epithelium and can contain adnexal structures such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The presence of Actinomyces colonization in this case is a common incidental finding and does not impact the diagnosis. Teratomas typically contain elements from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), which is not seen in this case. Hairy pharyngeal polyps and squamous papillomas are unrelated entities and do not fit the clinical or histologic findings described.
C
49
C: Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics

Explanation: The patient has presented with bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain along with a history of recent chemotherapy. The presence of hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber of the eye) suggests an infection. Given the patient's immunocompromised state and symptoms, it is important to obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and administer intravitreal antibiotics to treat the infection. This should be done promptly to prevent further complications and potential vision loss. Observing or waiting for systemic laboratory tests and blood culture results may delay appropriate treatment and could lead to worsening of the patient's condition. Performing pars plana vitrectomy is not necessary at this point as it is a surgical procedure typically reserved for more severe cases or complications not present in this patient's case.

C: Order genetic workup

Explanation: Given the patient's complex medical history and the presence of vertical and torsional nystagmus since birth, it is important to consider a genetic cause for her eye movement abnormalities. Conducting a genetic workup would help identify any underlying genetic mutations or syndromes that may be contributing to her condition. This will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and potential management options.

The correct answer is C: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation, including nonhealing cutaneous ulcers on the chest and upper extremities, along with the histopathological findings of a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils and reactive histiocytes, is consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV). LCV is a type of small vessel vasculitis characterized by neutrophilic inflammation and damage to the blood vessel walls. It can manifest with skin findings such as palpable purpura, petechiae, or ulcers.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's nonhealing skin ulcers includes leukemia cutis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and lymphomatoid papulosis. However, the absence of circulating blasts on the complete blood cell count and the absence of immature myeloid precursors on immunohistochemical staining make leukemia cutis unlikely. Pyoderma gangrenosum typically presents as painful ulcers with undermined borders, but the histopathological findings of LCV differ from those of pyoderma gangrenosum, which is characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the dermis without evidence of systemic vasculitis. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents as recurrent papulonodules and lacks the neutrophilic infiltrate seen in this patient's biopsy.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which can occur as an extramedullary manifestation of myelodysplastic syndrome. Treatment may involve systemic corticosteroids and potentially other immunosuppressive agents, depending on the severity of the disease and any underlying conditions.

B: Genetic testing

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of kidney disease since a young age and the anomalous appearance of both optic discs, a genetic cause for her visual changes should be considered. Genetic testing can provide valuable information about any underlying genetic mutations or disorders that may be contributing to her visual symptoms. This can help guide further management and treatment options for the patient.

53
B: Angioleiomyoma

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a tender, enlarging scalp lesion with overlying vessels is suggestive of an angioleiomyoma. Angioleiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumors that commonly present as small, painful nodules on extremities, particularly in middle-aged adults. Histopathologic analysis of the skin biopsy in this case would likely show proliferation of tumor cells around small vessels, as well as scattered mitoses and necrosis. Smooth muscle actin staining would also be positive in an angioleiomyoma. The other answer options (A: Symplastic glomus tumor, C: Solitary fibrous tumor, D: Malignant myopericytoma) do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings described in the case.

My diagnosis would be A: Patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques on the left upper arm and chest, along with the absence of triggers such as infection, insect bites, or trauma, is consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is a low-grade vascular neoplasm that commonly affects the skin and mucous membranes. The histopathological examination of the skin biopsy specimen showed irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis, which is characteristic of Kaposi sarcoma. The positive staining of endothelial cells for cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 further supports the diagnosis. Kaposi sarcoma should be considered in patients with similar clinical and histopathological findings.

55
I would choose answer option D: Check amiodarone plasma level.

Explanation: The patient developed pulmonary edema following the administration of amiodarone, a known side effect of the medication. Checking the amiodarone plasma level can help determine if the patient is experiencing amiodarone toxicity, which can present with acute respiratory distress and pulmonary infiltrates. Adjusting the dosage or discontinuing the medication may be necessary to manage the patient's symptoms.

56
B: Perform provocative drug testing with procainamide.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with syncope, frequent PVCs, and episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suggests a high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. The next step would be to perform provocative drug testing with procainamide to assess the patient's susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia and the potential need for further intervention, such as implantation of a defibrillator or ablation of PVCs. This will help in determining the most appropriate management strategy for the patient.

57
Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy (Option C). 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with abdominal pain, distention, tympanic abdomen, and signs of sepsis (hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, elevated CRP) is concerning for a perforated viscus, likely due to a gallstone-related complication such as cholecystoduodenal fistula. The CT scan findings of a thickened gallbladder with air and gallstones adherent to the duodenum support this suspicion. 

Immediate surgical intervention is necessary to treat the perforation and potential peritonitis. Administering barium to evaluate for bowel obstruction (Option A) may not be appropriate in this acute setting and could delay necessary surgical management. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Option B) may provide additional diagnostic information but should not delay surgical intervention in this unstable patient. Planning for surgical intervention after fluid resuscitation in the ICU (Option D) would also delay treatment and increase the risk of septic complications.
B: Obtain a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens.

Explanation: In this case, the patient is presenting with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a petechial rash. Given her symptoms and the fact that she is a farmer, it is important to consider the possibility of a gastrointestinal infection. Choosing option B to obtain a PCR panel for gastrointestinal pathogens would help identify the causative pathogen, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites, that may be responsible for her symptoms. This would provide valuable information for appropriate treatment and management of the patient's condition.

I would choose answer option A: Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin.

Explanation: Given the patient's previous resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir due to UL97 and UL54 gene mutations, and the lack of improvement in retinal pathology despite multiple intravitreal injections of these medications, it would be prudent to try an alternative approach. Systemic cidofovir along with CMV immune globulin can be considered as an alternative treatment option for CMV retinitis. Regular monitoring of the patient's visual acuity and retinal lesions should be performed to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.

The answer is C: High-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary.

Explanation: The patient presented with a palpable left axillary mass, but there were no breast lesions detected on mammography or magnetic resonance imaging. The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma, which was positive for PAX8, suggesting a breast origin. The patient had a history of estrogen use and underwent a hysterectomy, which may be risk factors for breast cancer. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary, as the primary tumor site in the breast cannot be identified.

The correct answer is C: Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant.

Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. It is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a subcutaneous mass with hair and cartilage components. The lesion is typically located along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and may extend into the subcutaneous fat. Histopathologic examination reveals normal-appearing skin, pilosebaceous follicles, adipose tissue, and segments of cartilage. Van Gieson stain can be used to highlight the elastic fibers surrounding the chondrocytes. This diagnosis is important to differentiate from other neck masses, such as branchial cleft cysts, epidermoid cysts, and hair follicle nevi.
C
62
The diagnosis is: C: Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst.

Explanation: The characteristics of the mass, including its slow growth, well-circumscribed nature, and presence of cyst-like spaces filled with serous fluid, along with the presence of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells, and thin trabeculae of woven bone surfaced with osteoblasts, are consistent with a soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst. The USP6 locus rearrangement detected on florescence in situ hybridization is a genetic abnormality commonly associated with aneurysmal bone cysts. Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor and soft tissue osteosarcoma typically have different histologic features and do not present with the same characteristics described for this patient. Soft tissue giant cell tumor is also a possibility, but the presence of cyst-like spaces and the absence of atypical mitoses or pleomorphic cells make aneurysmal bone cyst a more likely diagnosis.
C
63
Based on the clinical image, dermoscopy findings, and ultrasound results described, the most likely diagnosis is C: Median raphe cyst.

Explanation: The pinpoint orifice on the glans penis, surrounded by peripheral telangiectasias and the linear bluish structure seen on dermoscopy, are consistent with the characteristics of a median raphe cyst. The ultrasonography findings of a hypoechoic focal zone containing multiple hyperechoic bilaminar tracts further support this diagnosis.

A pilonidal sinus typically occurs in the sacrococcygeal area and presents as a cyst or sinus tract filled with hair and debris. Cutaneous larva migrans is a skin infection caused by the larvae of dog or cat hookworms, which results in serpiginous, pruritic, erythematous tracks on the skin. A vellus hair cyst is a benign cyst that forms from the sebaceous glands and is typically found on the scalp.

B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of diabetes and the appearance of hyperpigmented macules and bullae on the right lower extremity, a skin biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. A skin biopsy can help diagnose the underlying cause of the blisters and rule out other potential causes. Additionally, performing direct immunofluorescence can help identify any immune-mediated processes or autoimmune conditions that may be contributing to the blistering. This information can guide further treatment and management of the patient.

A: Request a magnetic resonance image of orbits and sinuses.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including sudden painless vision loss, earache, night sweats, and weight loss, are concerning for a possible underlying pathology affecting multiple systems. The presence of a cherry red spot in the right macula and the thickening of inner retinal layers seen on optical coherence tomography suggest a vascular event in the eye, which could be related to inflammation or vasculitis. To further investigate the cause of these findings and assess for potential sinus involvement, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the orbits and sinuses would provide valuable information. This can help evaluate for any structural abnormalities or inflammatory processes that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

66
B: Sinus biopsies

Explanation: Given the patient's risk factors for invasive fungal sinusitis (recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma, immunocompromised status, proptosis, new thickening of the left sphenoid sinus), sinus biopsies should be performed to rule out invasive fungal sinusitis as a cause of the orbital inflammation. The worsening symptoms despite broad-spectrum antibiotics also suggest a potential fungal etiology.

67
B: Perform laser iridotomy

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency suggest a potential adverse reaction to acetazolamide, which is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to lower intraocular pressure. These symptoms could be indicative of a systemic allergic reaction, such as bronchospasm or anaphylaxis. In this case, performing laser iridotomy would help alleviate the acute angle closure and relieve the increased intraocular pressure, which is likely contributing to the patient's symptoms.

68
Answer: C: Medication hypersensitivity reaction

Explanation: The patient's worsening rash after starting capecitabine suggests a medication hypersensitivity reaction. Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug commonly used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. It is known to cause dermatologic side effects, including hand-foot syndrome, which presents with erythema, edema, and desquamation on the palms and soles. In this case, the rash is not limited to the palms and soles and has not responded to topical or systemic treatments for infection. Cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer would typically present as firm, nodular skin lesions, while actinic keratoses and discoid lupus erythematosus would not typically present in this manner in a patient with metastatic breast cancer.

69
The correct answer is D: Granular cell tumor.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of intermittent stridor, which worsens during activities and later occurs at rest and during sleep, is suggestive of an upper airway obstructive process. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a nearly obstructive mass in the distal cervical trachea, which was confirmed by chest radiography. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass emanating from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea.

Granular cell tumors (GCTs) are rare neoplasms derived from Schwann cells. They can occur in a variety of locations, including the trachea. GCTs are usually benign and slow-growing tumors, but they can occasionally be malignant. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination, which shows characteristic granular cells exhibiting S100 protein positivity. Treatment typically involves surgical excision, which was performed in this case.

A. Chondroma: Chondromas are benign tumors composed of hyaline cartilage. They are not typically found in the trachea.

B. Glomus tumor: Glomus tumors are benign neoplasms that arise from the glomus bodies, which are specialized arteriovenous structures involved in temperature regulation. They are not typically found in the trachea.

C. Schwannoma: Schwannomas are benign tumors derived from Schwann cells. While they are a possibility, granular cell tumors are a better fit for this case based on the description of the histopathology.

D. Granular cell tumor: Granular cell tumors are rare neoplasms derived from Schwann cells, which can occur in the trachea. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and intraoperative findings in this case are consistent with a granular cell tumor.
C
70
The answer is C: Cholesteatoma.

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings and imaging results, cholesteatoma is the most likely diagnosis. Cholesteatoma refers to the presence of an abnormal skin growth in the middle ear. It typically causes conductive hearing loss and can lead to complications such as erosion of the temporal bone and mastoid air cells. The imaging findings, including osteolysis of the temporal bone, soft tissue opacification of the mastoid air cells, and suspected communication into the soft tissues of the neck, are consistent with cholesteatoma. The presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the middle ear indicates a CSF leak, which may be related to the cholesteatoma eroding through the tegmen.
A
71
The diagnosis is A: Hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques on the trunk and extremities is consistent with hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy medication commonly used for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis. Long-term use of hydroxyurea has been associated with cutaneous complications, including ulcerations. The cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g further supports the association with hydroxyurea therapy. The patient's medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa) is a relevant factor as well, as it suggests a propensity for cutaneous malignancies. Tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the diagnosis.

72
My Diagnosis: D: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis.

Explanation: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the formation of multiple subcutaneous nodules that progressively enlarge and become more numerous over time. The nodules are typically hard, painless, and have a smooth surface. In this case, the patient's history of multiple scalp nodules and subcutaneous nodules is consistent with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The presence of consanguineous parents suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which is common for this condition. The other options, including infantile myofibromatosis, Mafucci syndrome, and lipoid proteinosis, do not match the clinical presentation described.

73
Answer: C: Start intravenous magnesium.

Explanation: Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QT interval. One of the main causes of TdP is electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypomagnesemia. In this case, the patient's magnesium level is 1.7 mg/dL, which is below the normal range. Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to start intravenous magnesium supplementation. This can help correct the magnesium deficiency and potentially stabilize the patient's cardiac rhythm. Discontinuing metoprolol may also be considered, as beta-blockers can further prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of TdP. However, the immediate priority is treating the underlying electrolyte abnormality, hence starting intravenous magnesium is the best choice.

74
D: 100% Oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position.

Explanation: Based on the sudden onset of dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain during cardiac catheterization, the patient may be experiencing a pulmonary embolism. The management of a pulmonary embolism includes optimizing oxygenation with 100% oxygen, providing intravenous fluid to maintain hemodynamic stability, and placing the patient in a Trendelenburg position to improve venous return. Pericardiocentesis, intravenous thrombolysis, and catheter-directed thromboembolectomy are not appropriate for the given clinical scenario.

C: Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction

Explanation: Given the presence of pigmented corneal lesions and anterior chamber cells, it is important to rule out any infectious etiology. Obtaining aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction can help determine if the lesions are caused by a fungal infection. This is a reasonable next step in the management of the patient.
C
cellvalue empty
76
C: Angiosarcoma

Explanation: The recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules in this case, along with the patient's history of tumor stage mycosis fungoides, previous radiation therapy, and chronic graft vs host disease, are highly suggestive of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the endothelial cells of blood vessels. It can occur as a primary neoplasm or secondary to chronic lymphedema or radiation therapy. In this case, the nodules are likely secondary angiosarcoma following radiation therapy. Biopsies revealing granulation tissue further support this diagnosis. Additional tests, such as immunohistochemistry, can help confirm the diagnosis.
C
cellvalue empty
77
C: IgG4-related disease

Explanation: The case presentation describes a middle-aged woman with bilateral orbital inflammation, sinusitis, and systemic symptoms such as photophobia, rhinorrhea, and headaches. There is a personal history of poorly controlled diabetes and a family history of chronic orbital swelling. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging reveal sinus opacification, orbital fat stranding, and enlargement of extraocular muscles, particularly the right superior rectus. Biopsy of orbital tissue shows nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis.

The elevated levels of total IgG and IgG4, along with the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates seen on biopsy, support the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. This is an autoimmune condition characterized by IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration and fibrosis in various organs, including the orbits, sinuses, and salivary glands. It often presents with mass-like lesions, such as the enlarged extraocular muscles seen in this case.

Graves disease, another common cause of proptosis, would typically be associated with hyperthyroidism, which is not mentioned in the case. Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension would have specific histopathological findings such as necrosis, which are not seen in the biopsy results. Sarcoidosis could cause bilateral orbital involvement, but there is no mention of systemic symptoms such as pulmonary involvement or erythema nodosum, and the biopsy findings do not match those of sarcoidosis.
C
78
Answer: B: Immunotherapy-related inflammation

Explanation: The patient's presentation of redness, swelling, and formation of a white head followed by drainage is consistent with an inflammatory response related to the neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. This type of immunotherapy can lead to immune-related adverse events, which can include inflammation at the tumor site. The absence of pain, fever, leukocytosis, foul-smelling discharge, and negative cultures suggest that the symptoms are not due to infection. Tumor progression would be unlikely to result in these specific symptoms. Lastly, an allergic reaction would typically present with different symptoms such as itching, hives, or wheezing.
B
79
Based on the description provided, the most likely diagnosis for the persistent green-blue plaque in a healthy woman is C: Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor).

Explanation:
- Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (A) is a rare, benign tumor that typically presents as a solitary pigmented nodule or plaque. It is usually found in the sun-exposed areas of the skin and does not typically cause pain or persistent symptoms.
- Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor (B) is a recently described benign tumor that is characterized by fibrous, lipomatous, and hemosiderotic components. It typically presents as a slowly growing mass in the subcutaneous tissue, but does not typically cause discoloration or persistent pain.
- Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) (C) is a variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which is a rare but locally aggressive soft tissue tumor. It usually presents as a dermal plaque or nodule, and the pigmented variant is characterized by the presence of melanin within the tumor cells. It can cause pain and persist despite conservative measures.
- Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (D) is a low-grade malignant soft tissue tumor that typically presents as a subcutaneous nodule or mass. It can be associated with pain and local symptoms, but it does not typically present as a blue-green plaque.

Given the history of a persistent painful bruise-like lesion that appeared after trauma and the subsequent findings on imaging and excision, the diagnosis of pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) is the most likely explanation.

C: Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER)

Explanation: The clinical presentation of numerous erythematous edematous papules and plaques, along with the presence of eosinophilia on the complete blood count, is consistent with EPPER. EPPER is a rare cutaneous reaction to radiotherapy, typically occurring within weeks to months after treatment. The rash is characterized by pruritic papules and plaques, often with an annular or polycyclic configuration and central hyperpigmentation. Histopathological examination reveals a dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, in the dermis. EPPER is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other potential causes of the rash should be ruled out.

81
I would choose option C: Transthoracic echocardiogram.

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation and the findings on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a transthoracic echocardiogram would be the next appropriate step. This imaging modality can provide further evaluation of the right ventricular (RV) function and confirm the extent of the ventricular wall abnormalities seen on MRI. It can also help assess for any associated valvular abnormalities or other structural heart disease. The results of the echocardiogram would provide valuable information to guide further management and treatment decisions for the patient.

82
The correct answer is D: Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO syndrome).

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe neck pain, along with the presence of pustules on both hands and signal abnormalities in the cervical vertebrae on MRI, is highly suggestive of SAPHO syndrome. SAPHO syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a combination of osteoarticular and dermatological manifestations. It typically presents with inflammatory osteoarticular lesions, such as hyperostosis and osteitis, along with skin manifestations, including palmoplantar pustulosis. The MRI findings of abnormal enhancement in the C1/C2 vertebrae and hyperostotic anterior osteophytes at C4/C5 are consistent with the osteoarticular involvement seen in SAPHO syndrome.

The other answer options can be ruled out based on the negative results of the workup for infectious and malignant causes, as well as the specific clinical manifestations seen in SAPHO syndrome. Neurosyphilis typically presents with neurological symptoms, which are not prominent in this case. Metastatic tumor would typically show evidence of malignancy on PET/CT scan, which is not seen in this patient. Rickettsial infection would lead to positive rickettsial antibodies in the workup, which were negative in this case.

B: Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque.

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of ulcerated white plaques on the soft palate, accompanied by submandibular lymphadenopathy and a history of sexual contact, a biopsy of the plaque would help in establishing the definitive diagnosis. This is important to rule out potentially serious conditions such as malignancy or infectious processes like syphilis. Serologic test results for Treponema pallidum should also be obtained but they may take time to be available, whereas a biopsy can provide more immediate information. Prescribing antibiotics like oral amoxicillin or topical antifungals like nystatin without a confirmed diagnosis would be premature.

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option A). 

Explanation: The amelanotic nature of the choroidal lesion, the presence of subretinal fluid, and the scattered areas of hyperpigmentation raise suspicion for a choroidal melanoma. It is important to differentiate a melanoma from other possible diagnoses, such as choroidal nevus or metastasis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis by obtaining a tissue sample for histopathological examination and cytogenetic analysis. This will help guide further management decisions.

Options B, C, and D are not the most appropriate next steps in this case. Rituximab and radiotherapy (Option B) are typically used in the treatment of lymphoma or leukemia, but the patient's medical history does not suggest hematological malignancy. Positron emission tomography scan (Option C) is useful for staging and evaluating systemic metastasis in certain cancers, but it is not the initial step in evaluating an ocular choroidal lesion. Plaque brachytherapy (Option D) is a treatment option for choroidal melanoma but should not be performed without a confirmed diagnosis.
Answer: A: Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics

Explanation: Given the patient's history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ and chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma, there is suspicion for metastasis to the choroid. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics can help confirm the diagnosis by obtaining tissue samples for analysis, allowing for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning. It is important to determine whether the choroidal mass is metastatic disease or a primary ocular tumor to guide further management.

86
B: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis from COVID-19 vaccine.

Explanation: The patient's history of receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and the onset of the rash a few days after vaccination suggest a possible vaccine-related reaction. The physical examination findings of a rapidly progressing rash and swelling on the left side of the chest are consistent with vasculitis. The punch biopsy of the skin showing a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis is not characteristic of angiosarcoma or primary adnexal gland carcinoma. Inflammatory breast cancer would typically present with more specific signs such as warmth, erythema, peau d'orange appearance, and lymphadenopathy.

The correct answer is A: Madelung disease. 

Explanation: Madelung disease, also known as multiple symmetrical lipomatosis, is a rare condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fat deposits in various areas of the body, including the neck. It typically affects middle-aged men with a history of alcohol abuse, although this patient had no history of alcohol use. The neck mass in Madelung disease is usually bilateral, compressible, and can cause symptoms such as dysphagia and difficulty breathing, which were seen in this case. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as MRI, which can show the extensive areas of fat deposition. The treatment is typically surgical intervention to remove the excess fat. Liposarcoma, familial lipomatosis, and drug-induced lipomatosis are less likely in this case, given the patient's clinical presentation and history.
A
88
The correct answer is C: Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of linear, hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs, along with their linear distribution on the face, trunk, and extremities, is consistent with porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN). PEODDN is a rare, nonheritable disorder characterized by the presence of hyperkeratotic papules with central plugged ostia that typically follow Blaschko lines. The lesions can be present since birth or early childhood and do not spontaneously regress. In this case, the patient also presented with associated alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows, which is a known feature of PEODDN.

Dermoscopic examination in PEODDN shows central white spines or filiform keratotic plugs on the skin surface, consistent with the findings in this case.

Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy from a lesion showing hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and dilated epidermal invaginations with thinner granular layers and dilated eccrine ostia and acrosyringia under the parakeratotic columns is also typical of PEODDN.

Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN) is characterized by linear verrucous lesions that may be pruritic, but it does not typically present with comedo-like plugs or central white spicules.

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, proliferative disorder caused by the trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV). It is characterized by the development of spiny follicular papules and alopecia, typically seen in immunocompromised individuals, which is not consistent with the presentation in this case.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis presents with multiple, small, finger-like hyperkeratotic papules, typically on the extremities. The lesions are not linear or distributed in a linear pattern as in this case.

The correct answer is C: Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of nonhealing ulcers in the groin and axillae, along with symptoms such as scaling and greasiness on the scalp, polyuria, polydipsia, and hepatomegaly, suggest a multisystem disease. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of Langerhans cells in various organs. It can manifest with different clinical presentations, one of which is cutaneous involvement with ulcer formation. Histopathological examination of the ulcer bed showed infiltration of atypical cells with characteristic features of Langerhans cells, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry positive for CD1a. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

I would choose answer option D: Electrophysiology study.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of heart failure, preserved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, and recurrent presyncope, it is important to further evaluate the underlying cause of the bradycardia and recurrent symptoms. An electrophysiology study can help identify any conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This test can provide more detailed information about the electrical system of the heart and guide further management decisions, such as the need for pacemaker implantation. Ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise treadmill test, or an echocardiogram may provide additional information but are less likely to directly assess the underlying electrical conduction abnormalities.

91
C: Paraneoplastic myositis

Explanation: Based on the information given, the patient presented with proximal weakness, progressive camptocormia (flexed spine posture), head drop, dysphagia, and weight loss. These symptoms, along with the wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles, suggest a neuromuscular disorder. The presence of a paraprotein on serum electrophoresis and immunofixation, along with low-positive Mi2 antibodies, indicates a possible paraneoplastic process. Paraneoplastic myositis is often associated with an underlying malignancy, which in this case could be the patient's history of thyroid cancer. The muscle biopsy findings of atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance are consistent with myopathic changes seen in paraneoplastic myositis. Therefore, option C, Paraneoplastic myositis, is the most likely diagnosis in this case.
D

92
I would choose option B: Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has symptoms and risk factors consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), including loud snoring, weight gain, hypertension, and infrequent awakenings with breathlessness. The patient's BMI is also indicative of severe obesity, which is associated with an increased risk of OSA. Additionally, the home sleep test results are not provided in the question, but considering the patient's symptoms and risk factors, it is likely that the test would confirm the diagnosis of OSA.

CPAP therapy is the gold standard treatment for OSA and should be initiated in patients with significant symptoms, such as the patient described in the case. CPAP helps to keep the airway open during sleep by delivering a continuous flow of pressurized air, thereby preventing obstruction and improving ventilation.

Option A, advising the use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position, may be helpful as a lifestyle modification to reduce the severity of OSA, but it is not the recommended initial treatment approach.

Option C, performing laboratory-based polysomnography, may be considered in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or if additional information is needed, but in this case, the information provided strongly suggests a diagnosis of OSA, and waiting for additional testing may delay appropriate treatment.

Option D, repeating the home sleep apnea test, may not be necessary if the initial test is positive, and treatment can be initiated based on the clinical presentation and risk factors. Additionally, initiating treatment without delay is important in patients with significant symptoms to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications associated with untreated OSA.

B: Perform systemic workup, including chest imaging.

Explanation: The patient's complaints of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion, along with diffuse facial edema and erythema, raise concerns for systemic involvement. These symptoms may indicate a systemic disease process that could be contributing to the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma progression. Performing a systemic workup, including chest imaging, can help identify any underlying conditions that may be causing these symptoms and potentially affecting the management of glaucoma. This would allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's overall health and guide further treatment decisions. The other options (A, C, and D) do not address the need for a systemic workup and are more focused on intraocular interventions.

94
D: Perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with acute, progressive proptosis, pain, swelling, redness, binocular diplopia, choroidal folds, optic disc edema, and an intraconal mass on both MRI and ultrasound suggests an urgent need for further evaluation and management. Given the clinical findings and imaging results, an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy is warranted to determine the nature of the lesion and guide appropriate treatment. This approach allows for direct visualization and sampling of the lesion, providing crucial information for accurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Admitting the patient to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics, ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test, or starting high-dose steroids alone may not address the underlying cause of the orbital mass and could potentially delay necessary intervention.

The answer is A: Rosai-Dorfman disease.

Explanation:
The presented case features a 12-year-old boy with symptoms of nasal obstruction, dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial CT scan suggested suppurative lymphadenitis, but treatment did not resolve the lymphadenopathy. Subsequent MRI revealed bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes as well as enhancing nodules in the laryngeal ventricle, false vocal cord, and tracheal wall. Nasal endoscopy, laryngoscopy, and microlaryngoscopy showed yellow submucosal masses in the nasal cavity, laryngeal ventricle, and trachea. Biopsies of these masses and a cervical lymph node revealed infiltrates of histiocytes showing emperipolesis. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a.

Based on these findings, the diagnosis is Rosai-Dorfman disease. In this rare disorder, histiocytes infiltrate various tissues, including lymph nodes, causing painless lymphadenopathy and often involving extranodal sites. The classic histopathologic feature is emperipolesis, where intact lymphocytes are engulfed by histiocytes. Immunohistochemical staining can further confirm the diagnosis.
A
96
The correct answer is A: Oral hairy leukoplakia.

Explanation: Oral hairy leukoplakia is a condition characterized by white or gray raised patches on the lateral borders of the tongue that have a slightly hairy appearance. It is most commonly seen in individuals with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV infection. The lesions cannot be scraped off and are often asymptomatic, but in some cases, they can cause pain or discomfort, especially when exposed to spicy foods. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is often seen in individuals with HIV/AIDS.

B: Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ would be less likely as the lesions in this case are not consistent with malignancy. The clinical presentation, including the appearance, absence of ulceration, and lack of progression over 3 months, is not suggestive of carcinoma.

C: Secondary syphilis typically presents with a generalized rash, including mucocutaneous lesions. While this patient denies rash, the oral lesions in this case are not consistent with syphilis. Syphilis lesions would typically be painless and have a different appearance compared to the described hairy leukoplakia.

D: Herpetic infection would typically manifest as painful vesicles or ulcers. The lack of ulceration and the presence of bilateral raised leukoplakia lesions that cannot be scraped off are not consistent with herpetic infection.
C
97
C: Optical coherence tomography.

Explanation: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed cross-sectional images of the retina. In this case, the patient's symptoms and dilated fundus examination findings suggest the presence of juxtafoveal irregularities in both eyes. OCT can help further evaluate these irregularities and provide more information about the structural changes in the retina, such as any disruption in the retinal pigment epithelium or changes in retinal thickness. This can aid in the diagnosis and management of the patient's visual symptoms.

The correct diagnosis is B: Loose anagen syndrome.

Explanation: Loose anagen syndrome is a rare hair disorder characterized by hair that is easily pulled out. It typically presents in early childhood with short, sparse, and easily detachable hair. The hair is usually softer and lighter in color than normal hair. The condition is usually limited to the scalp and does not affect other areas of the body. Inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant in some cases. The hair pull test is positive with anagen hairs being easily extracted. Microscopic examination of the hair shafts does not show any structural abnormalities. Treatment options for loose anagen syndrome are limited, but the condition usually improves spontaneously with age.

99
The correct answer is D: Atypical pityriasis rosea.

Explanation: Pityriasis rosea is a common skin condition characterized by the sudden onset of oval-shaped, pink or red papules that are often scaly. The rash typically starts as a single larger "herald patch" and then spreads in a Christmas tree-like pattern on the trunk and proximal extremities. However, in atypical pityriasis rosea, the rash may take on a different appearance, such as the annular papules observed in this case. The intense pruritus also matches with a diagnosis of pityriasis rosea. Other clinical features, like the absence of involvement of the palms, soles, and oral mucosa, support the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea over other options on the list. The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen would further confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for pityriasis rosea is usually supportive, involving topical corticosteroids or antihistamines for symptom relief.

I would choose option C: Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiate cascade screening and high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily.

Explanation: Given the patient's strong family history of premature ASCVD and elevated Lp(a) level, it is important to address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. This includes lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and smoking cessation if applicable. Cascade screening should also be initiated to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a) levels as they may be at increased risk for ASCVD. Additionally, high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin should be started as this patient has risk-enhancing factors and evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis on coronary calcium scoring. PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may be considered in the future if other interventions are not enough to lower the Lp(a) level and reduce the risk of ASCVD.

101
C: Niemann-Pick disease type C

Explanation: The presented case is consistent with Niemann-Pick disease type C based on the following findings:
1. Progressive imbalance and ataxia: The patient has a history of progressively worsening imbalance and wheelchair dependence.
2. Neurological examination findings: Gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, slow saccades, gaze restriction, ataxic dysarthria, absent stretch reflexes, and mute plantar fascia indicate cerebellar dysfunction.
3. Chorea: Presence of chorea in both legs is a characteristic feature of Niemann-Pick disease type C.
4. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes: This finding suggests involvement of the lower limbs and is consistent with Niemann-Pick disease type C.
5. Electromyography findings: Sensory neuronopathy, as revealed by electromyography, can be seen in Niemann-Pick disease type C.
6. Brain MRI findings: Diffuse cerebellar atrophy and T2 hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus are consistent with Niemann-Pick disease type C.

Both Friedreich ataxia and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome typically present at an earlier age compared to the patient in this case. Mitochondrial ataxias usually have associated involvement of the ocular muscles, which is not seen in this patient. Therefore, Niemann-Pick disease type C is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical and neuroimaging findings.
D

102
C: Inject a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness.

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical findings are suggestive of a condition known as abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). ACNES is characterized by chronic intermittent abdominal pain localized to a small area, often associated with hypersensitivity to touch, pinching or cold, and can be exacerbated by abdominal muscle tension. In this case, the patient's pain is localized to a specific area in the left lower abdominal quadrant, and the pain increases with palpation, muscle tension, and cold stimuli.

Injecting a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, into the area of maximal tenderness can help confirm the diagnosis of ACNES. If the pain is relieved after the injection, it suggests that the abdominal wall nerves are the source of the pain. This diagnostic test can help differentiate ACNES from other causes of abdominal pain and guide further management.

Administering gabapentin may be considered for neuropathic pain management in cases of confirmed ACNES, but it is not the next step in diagnosis and evaluation.

Assessing celiac artery flow and measuring urine porphobilinogen level are not relevant in this context and would not help in the diagnosis or management of ACNES.

B: Obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of persistent fever, cough, mucositis, and vesiculobullous skin lesions is suggestive of an infectious etiology. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in children and can also present with extrapulmonary manifestations such as mucositis and skin lesions. Obtaining Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels can help confirm or rule out this infection as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option C: Await peritoneal dialysis fluid culture results before starting intraperitoneal antibiotics 

Explanation: Before starting any treatment, it is important to obtain the culture results from the cloudy peritoneal dialysis fluid to confirm the presence of peritonitis and identify the causative organism(s). This will help guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. Administering antibiotics without the culture results may lead to inappropriate treatment or unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotic use. It is important to wait for the culture results to ensure targeted and effective therapy.

105
The correct answer is D: Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis.

Explanation: In this case, the patient developed delayed-onset bilateral vocal fold paralysis following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. The symptoms started with mild odynophagia and dysphagia, which gradually progressed to shortness of breath and stridor. Laryngeal examination revealed limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally, and the modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration.

The patient's medical history and examination findings rule out other potential causes such as Arnold-Chiari malformation, spinal abscess, or underlying neurological disorders. The soft tissue computed tomography scan also did not show any evidence of abscess or fluid collection.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis, which refers to paralysis of the vocal folds as a complication of surgery. In this case, the paralysis is likely due to injury or compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerves during the anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. The gradual onset of symptoms and the absence of other underlying causes support this diagnosis.
D
106
C: Plaque brachytherapy

Explanation: Given that the lesion has been stable in size for many years and there are no concerning symptoms or signs of malignancy such as neovascularization or ectropion uvea, observation may be a reasonable option. However, considering the raised nature of the lesion and the presence of large pigment granules on the surface, fine-needle aspiration biopsy may not provide sufficient information and could potentially cause complications. Iridectomy for excision of the lesion may be an option, but given the location and size of the mass, plaque brachytherapy is a more appropriate approach. Plaque brachytherapy involves the use of a radioactive plaque on the surface of the eye to target and treat the tumor, while preserving surrounding tissue. This treatment modality has shown good outcomes for iris melanomas.

Answer: B: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis

Explanation: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare angiocentric and angiodestructive lymphoproliferative disorder that can present with cutaneous nodules. It typically affects middle-aged to elderly individuals and is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The clinical presentation includes multiple cutaneous nodules, often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Lymphadenopathy is also commonly observed. Histopathologic examination typically reveals atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes with proliferation of high endothelial venules. In situ hybridization for EBV is usually positive. Treatment usually involves systemic chemotherapy, targeting both the lymphoproliferative disorder and EBV infection.

The correct answer is A: Verrucous xanthoma.

Explanation:
Verrucous xanthoma is a rare benign condition characterized by the development of yellowish plaques on the oral mucosa. These plaques often have a cobblestone-like appearance. It typically affects middle-aged to older adults, and it can occur on the tongue, gums, or lips.

The histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen reveals eosinophilic, amorphous fissured masses in the subepithelial connective tissue. This is consistent with the findings in the case described.

Verrucous xanthoma is associated with hyperlipidemia and is often seen in individuals with a history of longstanding lipid disorders or immune disorders. In this patient, the absence of abnormalities in lipid profile and lab investigations suggests that the lesions may have developed independently of any underlying systemic disorder.

It is important to differentiate verrucous xanthoma from other similar conditions, such as colloid milium, nodular amyloidosis, and nodular colloid degeneration. Colloid milium is characterized by the deposition of colloid material in the mid-dermis, while nodular amyloidosis and nodular colloid degeneration involve the deposition of amyloid or colloid, respectively, in the connective tissue. These conditions have distinct histopathological features and clinical presentations, which do not match the findings in this case.
Therefore, the correct answer is A: Verrucous xanthoma.

Based on the provided information and the images, the most likely diagnosis for this case is:

A: Chromoblastomycosis

Explanation: Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, causing indurated plaques and ulceration. It is caused by several different fungi, including Fonsecaea and Cladophialophora species. The presence of large, firm, erythematous plaques with purulent discharge and crusting, as well as the histopathological findings of hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and multinucleated giant cells, are consistent with chromoblastomycosis. Transmission electron microscopy is often used to identify the fungal elements.

Cutaneous cryptococcosis, cutaneous protothecosis, and cutaneous leishmaniasis typically present with different clinical features and histopathological findings.

C: Perform coronary angiography

Explanation: This patient's presentation with intermittent chest pain and diaphoresis, along with elevated troponin T levels, suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG findings of biphasic T waves in leads V2 and V3 are also concerning for ischemia. Given the patient's risk factors (smoking, elevated LDL cholesterol), coronary angiography should be performed to evaluate for obstructive coronary artery disease and to guide further management. This is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.
C
cellvalue empty
111
Answer: C: Additional imaging, including a computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan.

Explanation: Given the recurrent nature of the orbital hemorrhage and the presence of a persistent proptosis and extraocular movement limitation, further imaging is necessary to evaluate the cause of the hemorrhage. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans can provide more detailed information about the orbital lesion and help identify potential underlying causes such as a tumor or vascular malformation. This would help guide further management and treatment options. Clinical follow-up alone may not provide enough information to determine the cause of the recurrent hemorrhage, while transconjunctival orbital biopsy may be invasive and should be considered if other imaging studies are inconclusive. Arteriography would be useful if there is suspicion of an orbital vascular malformation, but additional imaging should be performed first to confirm this suspicion.
C
cellvalue empty
112
B: Initiate an alternative systemic therapy (ie, an immunomodulatory agent)

Explanation: Given the refractory nature of the nodular scleritis and the lack of response to high-dose oral prednisone, topical prednisolone acetate, and oral ibuprofen, it is necessary to consider an alternative systemic therapy, such as an immunomodulatory agent. Immunomodulatory agents, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, can be effective in reducing inflammation and preventing relapse in cases of treatment-refractory scleritis. These medications help to control inflammation and minimize the need for high-dose systemic corticosteroids, which can have long-term side effects. Therefore, initiating an alternative systemic therapy would be the appropriate next step in the management of this patient's refractory nodular scleritis.

113
B: Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass.

Explanation: The most appropriate next step would be neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy, followed by globe sparing orbitotomy and surgical excision of the mass. This treatment strategy aims to address the orbital extension of the squamous cell carcinoma while preserving the globe and ocular function. Cemiplimab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody that can help enhance the patient's immune response against the cancer cells. The orbitotomy and surgical excision of the mass will aim to remove the tumor and prevent further local spread.

114
C: Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of melanoma and the presence of a pigmented epiretinal membrane, it is important to rule out the possibility of a metastasis or another malignant lesion. Performing a pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane would allow for histological examination and accurate diagnosis. This is particularly important in this case due to the patient's history of melanoma. Close observation or anti-VEGF injections would not address the need for a definitive diagnosis. Prescribing topical and systemic steroids would not be appropriate without further evaluation of the membrane.

115
The diagnosis in this case is B: Immunotherapy-related gastritis.

Explanation: The patient's history of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the previous treatment with nivolumab (an immunotherapy drug), suggests that the subacute epigastric pain and findings of diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum are likely related to the immunotherapy. Immunotherapy-related gastritis is a known adverse effect of immunotherapy drugs, and the clinical and histologic findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of viral cytopathic effects and negative immunostaining for common pathogens further support this diagnosis.
B

116
The correct answer is A: Cholesteatoma.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with a history of hearing loss and the presence of a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass in the middle ear, which is indicative of a cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is a noncancerous skin growth that occurs in the middle ear and can cause conductive hearing loss. The mass is usually composed of keratinized squamous epithelium and can erode surrounding structures, such as the ossicles and the mastoid bone. The pain experienced during palpation also supports the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can further confirm the presence of the mass and its relation to other structures.
C
117
The correct answer is B: Foregut duplication cyst.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of stridor and dysphagia, along with the imaging findings of a cystic mass abutting the trachea and hypopharynx with rightward deviation of the trachea and larynx, are consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. Foregut duplication cysts are congenital malformations that result from abnormal embryologic development of the gastrointestinal tract. They can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, including the neck. These cysts are typically lined with respiratory epithelium and can cause compression and displacement of adjacent structures, leading to symptoms such as stridor and dysphagia. In this case, the cyst is compressing the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus. The absence of vocal fold motion abnormalities on laryngoscopy and the lack of any mucosal tract on operative endoscopy help to differentiate this from other potential diagnoses such as thymic cysts, hemangiomas, or lymphatic malformations. Treatment usually involves surgical excision of the cyst.
B
118
C: Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a cystic mass in the postauricular area, which had been present since birth but slowly grew over the years, is suggestive of a first branchial cleft cyst. The cyst was located in the subcutaneous fat layer, superoposterior to the auricle. On microscopy, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, supporting the diagnosis. First branchial cleft cysts result from incomplete obliteration of the first branchial cleft during embryologic development and often manifest as cystic masses along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
C
119
The correct answer is B: Laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Explanation:
Laryngeal sarcoidosis is a rare manifestation of systemic sarcoidosis, an inflammatory condition characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in various organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. Laryngeal involvement is seen in less than 1% of sarcoidosis cases.

The presenting symptoms of difficulty phonating, odynophonia, globus sensation, mild dysphagia, and a swollen supraglottis are consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. The elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate further support the diagnosis. Additionally, the direct laryngoscopy and pathology results, showing subepithelial nonnecrotizing granulomas, confirm the diagnosis of laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (A) is a common condition that can cause similar symptoms of globus sensation, dysphagia, and vocal changes. However, the presence of granulomas in the pathology results differentiates laryngeal sarcoidosis from laryngopharyngeal reflux.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (C) is a systemic vasculitis that can involve the respiratory tract, including the larynx. However, it typically presents with upper respiratory symptoms, such as sinusitis, nosebleeds, and nasal crusting, which are not reported in this case.

Laryngeal tuberculosis (D) is a rare infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can present with similar symptoms of voice changes, dysphagia, and odynophonia. However, the absence of caseating granulomas on pathology and negative chest radiography make laryngeal tuberculosis less likely in this case.
B
120
The correct answer is D: Pemphigoid nodularis.

Explanation:
Pemphigoid nodularis is a rare subtype of bullous pemphigoid characterized by the presence of nodules on the skin. It typically affects older adults and is associated with intense itching and scratching, as seen in this case. Physical examination findings include disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated centers.

Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen typically shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis with irregular elongation of the rete ridges, fibrotic dermis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence may reveal linear deposition of immunoglobulin G along the basement membrane zone, which is consistent with pemphigoid nodularis.

Other options (A: Prurigo nodularis, B: Acquired perforating dermatosis, C: Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa) do not match the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case.

121
The correct answer is C: Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple cutaneous red papules that appeared at birth and progressed in number and size suggests a vascular disorder. The presence of hemorrhagic crust and dark scale on the lesions further supports a vascular etiology. The additional findings of retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia may indicate involvement of other anatomical regions.

Among the provided answer options:
A. Multifocal infantile hemangioma is unlikely because infantile hemangiomas typically have a characteristic clinical course with distinct proliferative and involution phases, and they usually appear after the first few weeks of life.
B. Bacillary angiomatosis is unlikely because it is caused by Bartonella infection and typically presents with vascular papules or nodules in immunocompromised individuals.
C. Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia is a rare disorder characterized by the widespread proliferation of lymphatic vessels, resulting in cutaneous papules and plaques. Thrombocytopenia is often present. This diagnosis fits with the clinical presentation and the histopathological findings of vascular proliferation in the upper dermis.
D. Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is unlikely because pyogenic granulomas are solitary or few in number and do not typically present at birth.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis in this case is C: Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia.
D

122
The diagnosis is D: Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve.

Explanation:
Based on the symptoms described, the patient presents with left-eye ptosis, vertical diplopia, and impaired left-eye supraduction. The presence of a nonreactive left pupil suggests a dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). While myasthenia gravis and Holmes Adie pupil can cause oculomotor nerve dysfunction, they are less likely in this case. Myasthenia gravis typically presents with fatigable weakness and would have been detected by repetitive nerve stimulation or anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody testing, which were negative in this case. Holmes Adie pupil typically presents with pupillary abnormalities, such as tonic pupils, which were not described in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve. This occurs when an abnormal blood vessel compresses the oculomotor nerve, leading to its dysfunction. In this case, the posterior communicating artery aneurysm is suspected to be causing the compression, as it was not detected on CT angiography. Further imaging, such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), may be required for confirmation.

A: Isolate the patient and notify public health authorities

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, with the presence of a dome-shaped nodule on the eyelid, vesicular lesions on the caruncle, and conjunctival hyperemia, the most likely diagnosis is ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. This viral infection is highly contagious, and isolating the patient is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection to others. Additionally, notifying public health authorities is important for appropriate management and contact tracing. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, specific treatment options such as antiviral medications, like oral acyclovir, may be considered. However, isolating the patient and notifying public health authorities should be the immediate next step.

Explanation: Given the patient's age, lack of ocular symptoms, and the presence of a calcified retinal lesion with vitreous seeds, a genetic cause should be considered. Genetic testing can help identify any underlying genetic mutations or syndromes that may be associated with the retinal lesion. Additionally, monitoring the lesion over time can help assess its growth and progression, which can further guide management decisions. Therefore, requesting genetic testing and closely monitoring the patient would be the most appropriate next step in this case.

D: Obtain fundus autofluorescence.

Explanation: Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows for the visualization of lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this case, the symmetric bilateral mottling of the RPE suggests dysfunction or damage to the RPE. Fundus autofluorescence can help identify areas of abnormal autofluorescence, which may correlate with RPE dysfunction and can aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of retinal pathologies. It provides valuable information about the metabolic function of the RPE and can help differentiate between different retinal disorders. Therefore, obtaining fundus autofluorescence would be the next appropriate step in the evaluation of this patient.

B: Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy

Explanation: Based on the patient's history of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery and the presence of numerous white retinal lesions, it is important to consider the possibility of persistent infection or intraocular inflammation. Performing a vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the vitreous and potential identification of the causative organism. It would also provide an opportunity to remove any persistent vitreous debris or inflammatory material that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This approach can help guide further treatment decisions and optimize the patient's visual outcomes.

127
C: Biopsy of the conjunctival lesion including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry

Explanation: Since the patient presented with an erythematous eyelid lesion followed by conjunctival swelling, it is important to determine the underlying cause of the lesion. One possible cause could be a neoplastic process, such as conjunctival lymphoma. Flow cytometry can help differentiate between benign and malignant processes by analyzing the cellular composition and detecting abnormal cell populations. Therefore, performing a biopsy of the conjunctival lesion, including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry, would be the next appropriate step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient.

The correct answer is D: Solitary fibrous tumor. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a slow-growing mass in the left cheek, along with the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed lesion with a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue and a central cystic/necrotic component, is consistent with a solitary fibrous tumor. The negative immunostaining for CK8/18, S100, SOX10, myosin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and CD31, along with the diffusely positive STAT6 staining, further supports this diagnosis. However, additional confirmatory tests such as a surgical specimen examination may be required for final confirmation.
D
129
The correct answer is A: Facial nerve schwannoma.

Explanation: The presented case shows a 21-year-old man with congenital left hemifacial weakness and unilateral left-sided hearing loss since birth. On examination, the patient had a peripheral left facial paralysis and a severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the left internal auditory canal, involving the facial nerve. This mass showed hypointensity on T2 and isointensity on T1, with strong enhancement after the injection of gadolinium.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a facial nerve schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors arising from the Schwann cells of the nerve sheath. In this case, the tumor arises from the facial nerve and has caused the enlargement of the internal auditory canal and dilation of the various portions of the facial nerve. Schwannomas typically show characteristic imaging features, such as isointensity or hypointensity on T1-weighted images and strong enhancement on contrast-enhanced images.

Vestibular nerve schwannoma is less likely as it primarily involves the vestibular nerve and may present with symptoms of vertigo or imbalance, which were not reported in this case. Neuromuscular choristoma and hemangioma do not fit the clinical and imaging findings described.
C
130
The diagnosis for this case is B: Lupus vulgaris.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a rapidly enlarging facial abscess along with the presence of a violaceous plaque and purulent drainage is consistent with lupus vulgaris, which is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis. The patient's history of travel to Kenya suggests a potential exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The negative tissue cultures and negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test do not exclude the diagnosis, as these tests can be falsely negative in cutaneous tuberculosis. Histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy showing suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis further supports the diagnosis. Treatment typically involves a combination of anti-tuberculosis medications.

131
B: Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation of supraventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic compromise, placing a temporary pacemaker is necessary to control the heart rate and prevent further complications. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated to prevent thromboembolic events, as the patient has undergone mitral valve surgery. Amiodarone can be started to help control the tachycardia. Urgent direct current (DC) shock should be considered if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. However, given the stable blood pressure and the ability of adenosine to temporarily slow down the ventricular rate, DC shock is not the most appropriate initial action. An urgent electrophysiologic investigation may be considered later to determine the underlying cause and long-term management, but immediate intervention to stabilize the patient is necessary.
C

132
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis for this 31-year-old man is A: Myotonic dystrophy.

Explanation: Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and weakness. It is a progressive condition that affects multiple systems in the body, including the muscles, heart, eyes, and endocrine system. The limited mobility of joints, along with the prayer sign and groove sign, are consistent with the muscular involvement seen in myotonic dystrophy.

Other options can be ruled out based on the clinical findings and test results:
- B: Systemic sclerosis typically presents with sclerotic skin plaques, Raynaud phenomenon, and other systemic symptoms such as gastrointestinal or pulmonary involvement.
- C: Deep morphea (morphea profunda) is a subtype of localized scleroderma that primarily affects the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissues. It is unlikely to cause the widespread joint involvement seen in this case.
- D: Eosinophilic fasciitis typically presents with symmetrical and painful swelling of the extremities, with characteristic skin changes and eosinophilia. The absence of these features makes this diagnosis less likely.
D
cellvalue empty
133
D: Treat with oral terbinafine.

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical presentation are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which is characterized by recurrent Candida infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes. In this case, the patient has a history of recurrent oral plaques, nail abnormalities, and skin lesions, all of which responded to treatment with oral antifungal medications.

The first-line treatment for CMC caused by Candida species, such as Candida albicans, is oral azole antifungal agents, such as itraconazole or fluconazole. However, given that the patient has previously been treated with itraconazole and the symptoms recurred once it was discontinued, restarting daily oral itraconazole may not be an effective long-term solution.

Alternatively, oral terbinafine is a systemic antifungal agent that is effective against dermatophyte infections, including Candida species. Terbinafine has been used successfully in the treatment of CMC and has a favorable profile with few side effects.

Administering oral cefazolin is not indicated in this case as it is an antibiotic typically used to treat bacterial infections, which is not the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Prescribing hydrocortisone cream would not be an appropriate treatment choice as hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid that may provide symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying fungal infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to treat her with oral terbinafine.

134
Answer Option: D: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma and the presence of upper eyelid retraction with lagophthalmos and enophthalmos without resistance to retropulsion, the next step would be to perform imaging of the orbit to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or involvement of the pituitary gland. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be the most appropriate imaging modality to assess the soft tissues and structures within the orbit. This would help to determine the underlying cause of the upper eyelid retraction and guide further management. Thyroid laboratory testing alone (Answer Option A) may be considered if thyroid dysfunction is suspected, but it appears less likely given the patient's history and clinical findings. Upper eyelid gold weight implantation (Answer Option B) would be a potential treatment option if the eyelid retraction is due to an upper eyelid ptosis, but it is not the appropriate next step in evaluation. Systemic steroid and antiviral therapy (Answer Option C) may be considered if a viral or inflammatory cause is suspected, but imaging should be performed first to evaluate for structural abnormalities.
D
cellvalue empty
135
B: Surgical excision

Explanation: Given the patient's history of cutaneous melanoma and the presence of a pigmented angle lesion, surgical excision would be the appropriate next step. The pigmented corneal mass could potentially be a metastasis from the patient's previous melanoma or a primary ocular melanoma. Therefore, surgical excision would allow for histopathological analysis to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further management.

136
Answer: B: Interventional radiology embolization and debulking

Explanation: The patient has a persistent vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face despite previous treatments. The lesion is causing significant symptoms, including amblyopia and extraocular muscle dysfunction. Therefore, the next step would be to consider interventional radiology embolization and debulking procedures to further manage the lesion and alleviate the symptoms.

The correct answer is: A: Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of asymptomatic, erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the scalp and face, along with the histological findings of sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrating the dermis and expanding apparent dermal blood vessels, are characteristic of intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (IALCL). Furthermore, the neoplastic cells forming a balloon appearance and the absence of epidermotrophism support this diagnosis. The immunohistochemical stains showing positivity for CD3 and negativity for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A are consistent with T-cell lymphomas like IALCL. The Ki-67 labeling index of 70% indicates a high proliferation rate. Immunohistochemical staining of D2-40 highlights the exclusive lymphovascular location of the lymphoma. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, histological findings, and immunohistochemical staining, the diagnosis is intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
A

138
The correct answer is C: Lepromatous leprosy.

Explanation:
The patient's history of hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and the biopsy results showing poorly formed granulomas are not consistent with sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Additionally, there are no features suggesting progression of mycosis fungoides.

The presence of large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation and the nasal septum deformity with compromise of the keystone junction is consistent with lepromatous leprosy. Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, characterized by skin plaques, nasal involvement, and deformities such as saddle-nose deformity.

The Fite acid-fast stain of the cutaneous lesion revealing pink bacilli further supports the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy. This stain is specific for acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium leprae, which is the causative organism in lepromatous leprosy.
C
139
The correct answer is D: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

Explanation: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a rare condition caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) leading to the development of benign squamous papillomas in the respiratory tract, including the larynx. It typically affects children and young adults and can cause symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphonia, and difficulty breathing.

In this case, the patient had persistent symptoms of postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia. The physical examination revealed tonsillar erythema, a mobile right level 2 lymph node, and an exophytic laryngeal mass on flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy.

The laryngeal biopsy showed inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia, which are consistent with the findings of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

The other answer options (A: Squamous cell carcinoma, B: Coccidioidomycosis, C: Tuberculosis) are unlikely in this case based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings. Squamous cell carcinoma typically presents with a malignant neoplasm and can involve the true vocal cords. Coccidioidomycosis and tuberculosis are fungal and bacterial infections, respectively, and do not typically present with the described symptoms and findings.
B
140
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this case is option C: Squamous cell cancer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive hoarseness, dyspnea, and laryngeal obstruction, along with the findings of severe laryngeal mucosal edema and right true vocal fold immobility on videostroboscopy, are highly concerning for a malignant process. The irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds seen on the CT scan further supports the possibility of squamous cell cancer. The laryngeal biopsy findings of edematous, irregular, and friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing are consistent with this diagnosis.

Options A (Sarcoidosis), B (Blastomycosis), and D (Tuberculosis) are less likely given the absence of relevant symptoms, such as fevers, unintentional weight loss, or cough, and the absence of lymphadenopathy or characteristic imaging findings for these conditions. Additionally, laryngeal sarcoidosis and blastomycosis are relatively rare compared to squamous cell cancer, which is more common in the population.
B
141
The diagnosis for this case is A: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.

Explanation: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, characterized by characteristic skin lesions and symmetrical arthritis. It typically presents in adults but can occur in children. The subcutaneous nodules seen in this patient, along with the joint deformities and other symptoms, are consistent with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Histopathological examination shows a granulomatous pattern, foamy cells, collagen degeneration, and mucin deposition. The presence of comma-shaped curvilinear tubular structures further supports the diagnosis. Other conditions such as juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, Farber disease, and rheumatoid nodules can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings.

142
The correct answer is C: Keloidal scleroderma.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation of firm, red-brown plaques without overlying scale on the proximal upper extremities and anterior trunk is consistent with keloidal scleroderma. Keloidal scleroderma is a rare variant of systemic sclerosis characterized by the formation of keloid-like plaques on the skin. It typically affects the proximal extremities and trunk. The absence of appreciable skin tightening in the affected areas differentiates keloidal scleroderma from the classic manifestations of systemic sclerosis. The histological findings of lesional punch biopsy specimens can further confirm the diagnosis.
C
cellvalue empty
143
The correct answer is A: Giant cell arteritis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of diplopia, ptosis, jaw pain, weight loss, and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) suggests an inflammatory process. The bilateral extraocular muscle involvement, as seen on MRI, is consistent with giant cell arteritis. Other features, such as headache and temporal artery tenderness, are not mentioned in the case, but are common findings in giant cell arteritis. The patient should undergo prompt treatment with high-dose corticosteroids to prevent complications such as vision loss. Anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and skin changes. Immunoglobulin G4–related disease can cause orbital inflammation and proptosis but is not associated with ptosis or jaw pain. Myasthenia gravis typically presents with fluctuating muscle weakness, often involving the extraocular muscles, and symptoms improve with rest or the ice-pack test, which is not the case in this patient.

144
Based on the provided information, the best course of action would be:

C: Perform an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including bilateral neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments, suggests a possible genetic component to her condition. Performing an electrooculogram (EOG) can help evaluate the function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is important in diagnosing conditions such as Best disease or adult-onset vitelliform dystrophy. Molecular genetic testing can further identify specific gene mutations that may be responsible for the patient's condition. This information can help guide treatment decisions and provide valuable information for prognosis and genetic counseling. Continuing anti-VEGF injections or starting photodynamic therapy would be less appropriate as a next step without further understanding of the underlying cause. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test would be more relevant if there were suspicion of a systemic disease or paraneoplastic syndrome, which is not indicated in this case.
D

145
B: Genetic testing 

Explanation: Given the progressive vision loss, cognitive impairments, and family history of vision loss, genetic testing would be the most appropriate next step. This can help identify any genetic mutations or disorders that may be causing the patient's symptoms. It can also provide important information for prognosis, counseling, and potential treatment options. Electroretinogram (ERG) and muscle biopsy may be considered in some cases, but genetic testing is the initial recommended step in this scenario. Observation alone would not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide management.

146
The correct answer is A: Eosinophilic sialodochitis. 

Explanation: The patient's recurrent and recalcitrant salivary gland swelling, along with the presence of eosinophils in both blood and histopathology, suggests eosinophilic sialodochitis. This condition is characterized by chronic inflammation of the salivary ducts, usually associated with eosinophilic infiltration. It typically presents with recurrent episodes of parotid swelling, pain, and pruritus. Diagnostic features include the absence of salivary stones or strictures on sialendoscopy and the presence of periductal eosinophilic infiltrates on histopathology. Other conditions such as Sjogren syndrome, sialolithiasis, and Mikulicz syndrome can be ruled out based on the patient's clinical presentation and workup findings.
A
147
Based on the presented case, the most likely diagnosis is D: Macrocystic lymphatic malformation.

Explanation:
- Foregut duplication cyst usually presents as a mass in the mediastinum or abdomen. It is rare to have it in the neck region.
- Branchial cleft cyst typically presents as a mass in the anterior triangle of the neck, not the submandibular region. It is also usually present since birth.
- Plunging ranula is a cystic dilatation of the sublingual gland, and does not typically extend into the neck region.
- Macrocystic lymphatic malformation is the most likely diagnosis in this case, as it presents as a cystic mass in the neck region, typically involving the submandibular gland. It can extend into adjacent structures, such as the tongue musculature. The presence of serous fluid, mucous-like contents, and the multiseptated appearance on MRI are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the recurrence of the mass after aspiration further supports the diagnosis of a lymphatic malformation.
A
148
The correct answer is C: Microvenular hemangioma.

Explanation:
Microvenular hemangioma is a benign vascular proliferation characterized by small, dilated vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. It typically presents as an ill-defined, plaque-like lesion with an atrophic appearance. The lesion is erythematous and violaceous in color and may be slightly raised. It is usually nonindurated and can be mildly pruritic.

Histopathological examination reveals a band-like vascular proliferation in the upper dermis with no grenz zone. The vascular channels are round and lined by a single layer of endothelial cells without atypia. Immunostaining with CD34 can be used to label the endothelial cells.

In this case, the patient presented with a gradually enlarging, pruritic, erythematous plaque on the leg, which had been unresponsive to topical corticosteroids and antifungals. The clinical presentation and histopathology findings are consistent with a diagnosis of microvenular hemangioma.

I would choose answer option B: Electrophysiology study.

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation with recurrent syncope, shaking, muscle jerks, and a family history of sudden cardiac death, an electrophysiology study would be the next appropriate step in the diagnostic workup. This study can help identify any abnormal electrical conduction in the heart that may be contributing to the syncopal episodes. It can also assess for any potential arrhythmias that could be responsible for the patient's symptoms.
C
cellvalue empty
150
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired hepatic copper transport leading to copper accumulation throughout the body. In Wilson disease, there is a defect in the ATP7B gene, resulting in decreased biliary copper excretion and increased hepatic copper levels. The excess copper is then released into the bloodstream and deposited in various tissues, including the liver, brain, cornea, and kidney.

The presence of bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin is known as the "Kayser-Fleischer ring" and is characteristic of Wilson disease. This finding is due to copper deposition in the Descemet membrane of the cornea. The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia also suggest liver involvement.

Anemia is a common hematologic manifestation of Wilson disease. In this case, the anemia is likely due to hemolysis resulting from the deposition of copper in erythrocytes, as evidenced by the small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions seen on the peripheral blood smear.

Given the clinical picture, the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient is to check the blood lead concentration (Option A). Lead toxicity can also cause abdominal pain and anemia, and the peripheral blood smear findings can be similar to those seen in Wilson disease. Therefore, ruling out lead toxicity is important in this case.

Explanation: A, Check blood lead concentration
B: Serum vascular endothelial growth factor

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with bilateral papilledema and symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. However, the lumbar puncture showed a normal opening pressure, which is unexpected in the presence of papilledema. Additionally, the patient has an elevated IgA λ-protein level, which may suggest an underlying systemic condition.

Given these findings, it would be appropriate to measure serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Elevated VEGF levels can be seen in conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), which can cause papilledema with normal intracranial pressure. Measuring serum VEGF can help confirm the diagnosis of IIH in these cases.

Fluorescein angiography may provide additional information about retinal blood flow, but it is not the next best step in this scenario. Repeated lumbar puncture may be considered if there is clinical suspicion of elevated intracranial pressure despite the initially normal lumbar puncture findings. Starting acetazolamide, a medication commonly used to treat increased intracranial pressure, may be considered if there is definitive evidence of elevated intracranial pressure. However, it would be premature to start treatment without confirming the diagnosis of IIH.

I would choose option B: Obtain positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging to look for additional metastases and biopsy sites.

Explanation: The patient's history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor raises concerns for recurrence. The bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement and other symptoms may be related to metastases. Obtaining PET-CT imaging would help identify any additional metastases and potential biopsy sites, which could aid in diagnosing the cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further treatment decisions.

153
D: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast and perform lumbar puncture.

Explanation: The patient has a history of cataract surgery and is currently presenting with worsening blurriness, photopsia, floaters, and vitritis. The presence of vitreous haze and anterior vitreous cell suggests intraocular inflammation. The multifocal chorioretinal scars extending from the optic nerve into the macula, with variable hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence, are concerning for an infectious etiology. The positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis raises the suspicion of ocular tuberculosis. In cases of suspected ocular tuberculosis, it is important to evaluate for systemic involvement, including central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis. Therefore, ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast and performing a lumbar puncture will help assess for any CNS involvement. This will assist in determining the need for specific antituberculous treatment and management. Therefore, the appropriate next step is to choose option D.
C
cellvalue empty
154
D: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics.

Explanation: The presence of a milky substance in the retrolental space and distension of the capsular bag suggests the possibility of a capsular bag distension syndrome (CBDS) or capsular bag opacification (CBO). CBDS is a rare phenomenon characterized by fluid accumulation in the retro-capsular space, leading to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual deterioration. The treatment of choice for CBDS involves surgical management, specifically a pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens (IOL) and capsular bag. Additionally, intravitreal antibiotics should be administered to prevent infection. Therefore, the appropriate course of action in this case would be to perform a pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the IOL and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics (option D).

156
The correct answer is B: Multicentric Castleman disease.

Explanation: Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by systemic lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, and inflammatory manifestations. It can present with cervical lymphadenopathy, as seen in this case. MCD is associated with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), which were both found to be elevated in this patient's laboratory results. The excisional biopsy of the enlarged cervical lymph node showed hypervascularity, onion-skinning of mantle zone lymphocytes, and the presence of atypical plasma cells, which are consistent with MCD. Imaging studies further support the diagnosis, as they revealed extensive lymphadenopathy and inflammation. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis can present with lymphadenopathy, but the patient's negative tests for HIV and normal inflammatory markers make this diagnosis less likely. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and sarcoidosis are other differential diagnoses, but they are less likely based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathological features.
B
157
The correct answer is D: Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of an asymptomatic verrucous plaque on the right temple with gradual development over time is characteristic of primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The histopathologic analysis also supports this diagnosis, showing papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia, neoplastic infiltration of small round blue cells, and positive staining for MyoD1. Other options such as superficial lymphatic malformation, primary superficial Ewing sarcoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma are less likely based on the clinical and histopathologic findings.
D
cellvalue empty
158
B: Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers

Explanation: The patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, CD4 count of 40 cells/mm3, and persistent/recurrent oral and perianal ulcers raise suspicion for an opportunistic infection related to immunosuppression. The biopsy of a perianal ulcer showed a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, with prominent admixed large and atypical cells. Further staining with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA showed scattered positivity in some cells, indicating EBV involvement.

Chronic ulcerative herpes simplex virus (A) would typically cause more superficial and less deep ulcerations, and the lesions are usually bilaterally distributed. Crohn's disease associated with pyostomatitis vegetans (C) is a rare manifestation of Crohn's disease and typically presents with plaques and pustules in the oral cavity, not punched-out ulcers. Ulcers secondary to fungal infection (D) would be unlikely in this case, as treatment with oral fluconazole for presumed thrush would have addressed the fungal infection and led to improvement in the patient's medical condition, which was observed.

159
The correct answer is D: Cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Explanation: 
The patient's presentation of bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, decreased sensation in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve, and lack of pupillary response to light or accommodation is consistent with cavernous sinus involvement. The known sellar/parasellar mass resulting in compression of the optic chiasm, as seen on the MRI before symptom onset, would be the likely cause of the cavernous sinus thrombosis. This diagnosis is supported by the subsequent MRI, which showed loss of central enhancement in the mass. Cavernous sinus thrombosis can lead to third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve involvement, resulting in ophthalmoplegia.

D: Order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with sudden onset painless jaundice and malaise, which can be indicative of acute viral hepatitis. The patient's negative results for hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and HIV suggest that these infections are not the cause of her symptoms. Given her history of chronic inactive HBV infection, it is important to consider the possibility of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) coinfection. HDV is a defective RNA virus that requires the presence of HBV to infect hepatocytes.

Testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies can help confirm whether the patient is currently infected with HDV. If the results are positive, further testing for HDV RNA can be performed to determine the viral load and guide management. HDV infection can lead to more severe liver disease compared to HBV infection alone, so early detection and intervention are important.

Therefore, ordering testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies, followed by HDV RNA testing if positive, is the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation.

161
B: Perform a biopsy of the left ear.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent eye and ear pain, along with erythema and swelling of the left eye and left ear, suggests a possible underlying inflammatory or autoimmune condition. Given the patient's elevated ESR and C-reactive protein levels, further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. A biopsy of the left ear would allow for histological examination and potentially provide a diagnosis, as the symptoms may be indicative of a localized vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). This would help guide further management and treatment options.
C

162
D: Obtain orbital imaging with intravenous contrast.

Explanation: Given the progressive nature of the ptosis, it is important to rule out any structural abnormalities or lesions in the orbit or surrounding structures. Orbital imaging with contrast can help identify any masses, abnormalities, or vascular lesions that may be causing the ptosis. This can include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Once the imaging results are obtained, further management can be determined based on the findings.

163
B: Order acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia, along with the findings of left hypertropia and limitation in infraduction in the left eye, suggest a diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). OMG is a disorder characterized by weakness of the eye muscles due to an autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.

Ordering acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers would help confirm the diagnosis of OMG. Positive antibody titers would indicate the presence of autoantibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors.

The other answer options are less likely to be the next appropriate steps in this case. Checking thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels would be more relevant if there were symptoms or signs suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, which is not described in the case. Ordering urgent computed tomography scan and computed tomography angiography of the brain would be more appropriate if there were signs of acute central nervous system pathology, such as severe headache with focal neurological deficits or altered mental status, which are not described in the case. Performing an urgent lumbar puncture would be more relevant if there were signs of meningitis or raised intracranial pressure, which are not described in the case.

Answer: D: Perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye.

Explanation: Given the presence of a large corneal epithelial defect with stromal thinning and infiltrate, and the lack of improvement with initial topical antibiotics, therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty is the most appropriate course of action. This surgical procedure involves replacing the diseased cornea with a healthy donor cornea and can help preserve vision and prevent further complications. Allergy testing, topical steroids, serum vitamin A levels, and corneal herpes simplex viral cultures are not indicated based on the clinical presentation and findings.

I would choose answer option A: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.

Explanation: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome is characterized by a thinning or absence of part of the bone that normally covers the superior semicircular canal in the inner ear. This can lead to abnormal inner ear fluid movements, resulting in symptoms such as vertigo, aural fullness, and hearing loss. The positive Dix−Hallpike test with rotary nystagmus seen in this case, as well as the presence of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss on the audiogram, are consistent with this diagnosis. Further tests, such as CT of the temporal bone, may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
B
167
B: Parathyroid cyst

Explanation:
Based on the clinical history, the physical examination findings, and the imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid cyst. This is supported by the elevated PTH level, the absence of solid nodularity on ultrasonography, and the positive PTH staining within the cystic lesion on pathological examination. Parathyroid cysts are typically asymptomatic and can present as a painless mass in the neck. They are usually benign and can be managed by surgical excision to relieve any compressive symptoms.
B
168
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is B: Parotid gland lymphoma. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of parotid swelling, absence of erythema or tenderness, intact cranial nerves (including the facial nerve), and absence of epithelial lesions suggest a non-infectious cause. The CT findings of an ill-defined infiltrative mass in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland, with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces, further support a neoplastic process. Additionally, the slight hematuria observed on urinalysis may indicate systemic involvement. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is parotid gland lymphoma.
C
169
The diagnosis is C: Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis.

Explanation: Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis is a rare condition characterized by progressive subcutaneous atrophy and erythematous borders. It mostly affects the abdomen, but in this case, it involves the neck, nape, and submandibular areas. On histological examination, there is no inflammatory cell infiltration within the dermis, which differentiates it from Lupus panniculitis. Additionally, the absence of trauma history and negative laboratory tests for Borrelia and HIV rule out other diagnoses. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn typically presents within the first few weeks after birth and resolves spontaneously, making it unlikely in a 2-year-old child.

170
C: Metastatic carcinoma

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, and histopathological examination of the skin lesion all suggest metastatic carcinoma as the diagnosis. The patient had a rapidly growing abdominal mass, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding, which are concerning for malignancy. The punch biopsy of the skin lesion revealed large atypical cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm forming papillary and glandular architectures, indicating metastatic cancer cells. The presence of lymphovascular invasion also supports the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. Lastly, the contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right rectus abdominis muscle and a cystic lesion in the left ovary, further suggesting metastatic disease.

A: Progressive supranuclear palsy

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of progressive parkinsonism, poor levodopa response, rapid cognitive decline, and features such as REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and visual hallucinations, along with the neuroimaging findings of hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis, the most likely diagnosis is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Lewy bodies observed in the brain biopsy also support the diagnosis of PSP. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes typically present with a different clinical picture, including focal neurological deficits and stroke-like episodes. Autosomal recessive parkinsonism and paraneoplastic syndrome do not align with the clinical findings in this case.

172
B: Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and the presence of ulcerated plaques on the scalp and dorsal hands, along with abnormal blood counts (low hemoglobin, low white blood cell count, and low platelet count), a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics is indicated to evaluate for potential hematologic malignancies such as leukemia or lymphoma. This will help determine if the patient's symptoms and skin findings are related to an underlying systemic disease.

173
B: Prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and refer for allergy testing

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms of pruritic wheals, transient eyelid swelling, and the development of wheal and flare lesions upon pressure (positive response to pressure provocation), it suggests an allergic reaction, specifically urticaria (hives). While the patient did not experience severe symptoms such as throat swelling or difficulty breathing, the use of an epinephrine autoinjector is recommended as a precautionary measure in case of an anaphylactic reaction. Referral for allergy testing can help identify the specific trigger for the allergic reaction and guide future management.
C

174
The answer is C: Recurrent parotid tumor.

Explanation: The patient's history of previous parotidectomy for a Warthin tumor, along with the presence of a small painful lump over the left neck, suggests the possibility of a recurrent tumor. The intermittent pain, tenderness, and worsening of symptoms on touch and head turning further support this diagnosis. The MRI results showing no focal lesion in either parotid gland or at the area of interest do not rule out the presence of a recurrent tumor, as small lesions may be difficult to detect on imaging. Therefore, an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
B
175
Based on the given information, the next appropriate step would be D: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve.

Explanation: The large subconjunctival mass near the Ahmed valve is likely a cyst or encapsulated bleb. Given the patient's history of intractable glaucoma and multiple ocular surgeries, transscleral cyclophotocoagulation can help reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production from the ciliary body. Additionally, removing the mass and the Ahmed valve can improve the surgical outcome. Bleb revision with excision of the mass may be considered if the mass is confirmed to be a bleb or encapsulated cyst. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass may only provide temporary relief and is not indicated in this case. Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity is not necessary at this point as the patient has a stable retina and removing the silicone oil could increase the risk of retinal detachment.

176
Answer option: B: Diagnose and treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of anemia, leukopenia, headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever, along with elevated inflammatory markers, the presence of papilledema on ophthalmic examination, and the finding of diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment on MRI, it is important to consider the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH, formerly known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without evidence of an underlying structural cause. It is more commonly seen in overweight females of childbearing age, although it can occur in patients of any age or gender.
To confirm the diagnosis, additional investigations such as a lumbar puncture to measure the opening pressure (which is elevated in IIH), MRI of the brain and orbits, and magnetic resonance venography should be performed, as described in the case. Since these investigations have already been done and suggestive findings of papilledema and elevated opening pressure were present, the next step would be to diagnose and treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
Management of IIH typically involves weight loss (especially in overweight patients), medications to reduce cerebrospinal fluid production (such as acetazolamide), and close ophthalmic monitoring to assess for improvement in papilledema. Repeat ophthalmic examinations are important to monitor the response to treatment and to evaluate for progression of the disease.
Performing a bone marrow biopsy (option C) would not be appropriate in this case, as there are no specific indications for a bone marrow biopsy based on the clinical presentation and findings described.
Repeat serial lumbar punctures (option D) may be considered in some cases of IIH to help alleviate symptoms by temporarily reducing intracranial pressure, but it is not the next step in the management of this patient.
C

177
B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit

Explanation: The patient's new-onset fluctuating diplopia, worsening right upper eyelid ptosis, and lack of improvement after ptosis repair indicate an underlying cause that needs to be investigated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit can help identify any structural abnormalities that may be contributing to these symptoms. This is an important diagnostic step to rule out conditions such as a mass lesion, myasthenia gravis, or other neurologic causes. Serum testing for autoantibodies, revision ptosis repair, and cholinesterase inhibitor therapy may be considered later based on the findings of the MRI.
B
cellvalue empty
178
D: Rule out an occult systemic neoplasm.

Explanation: Given the patient's age, the presence of an intraocular mass, and the absence of any history of ocular trauma or cutaneous melanoma, it is important to consider the possibility of an underlying systemic neoplasm. The absence of symptoms or signs in the right eye suggests a unilateral presentation, which further raises suspicion for a systemic etiology. Therefore, ruling out an occult systemic neoplasm is the appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.
D

179
The diagnosis is: D) Spinal cord infarct: underlying cause workup, supportive care.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance, along with the MRI findings of extensive spinal cord edema and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion without mass effect, suggest a spinal cord infarct. This is a result of compromised blood supply to the spinal cord leading to ischemic damage. Further workup is needed to determine the underlying cause of the infarct. Supportive care, including high-dose steroids, should be continued to manage symptoms.
The answer is C: Trigeminal schwannoma.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with gradually evolving facial and jaw symptoms, including right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus. The physical examination revealed tenderness in the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia in the right trigeminal nerve distribution. The MRI showed a cystic mass in the right side of the infratemporal fossa, which is characteristic of a trigeminal schwannoma. These tumors arise from the Schwann cells of the trigeminal nerve and can cause compression of adjacent structures, leading to the reported symptoms. Trigeminal schwannomas are typically nonenhancing on T1 sequencing and hyperintense on T2 sequencing.

181
The correct diagnosis is B: Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma.

Explanation: Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma is a rare condition characterized by the appearance of white and translucent papules, excessive wrinkling, and hyperkeratosis on the dorsum of the hands and wrists after water immersion. The symptoms are often accompanied by a burning sensation and pruritus. This condition typically worsens in warm weather and improves in colder temperatures.

The histopathologic features of Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma include hyperkeratosis, dilated eccrine ducts in the epidermis and dermis, and hyperplasia of the eccrine sweat glands. This is consistent with the histopathologic findings described in the case.

Other options such as eczema (A), hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (C), and progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (D) do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathologic features described in the case.

182
C: COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy)

Explanation: The patient's presentation of erythema and edematous necrotic plaques on the ears, along with the progression of necrosis involving the earlobes and helix, is suggestive of a vascular disorder. COVID-19 has been associated with various vascular manifestations, including thrombotic vasculopathy. This condition is characterized by microvascular thrombosis and occlusion, resulting in ischemia and tissue necrosis. The absence of devices on the ears rules out pressure necrosis. Levamisole-induced vasculitis usually presents with vasculitic lesions, which are different from the necrotic plaques described in the case. Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum typically occurs in immunocompromised patients, and its presentation is different from the ear plaques observed in this case.

183
A: Obtain a chest computed tomography (CT) scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, crackles on lung auscultation, and livedo racemosa on the palmar surfaces of her hands, suggest a possible underlying connective tissue disease. A chest CT scan can help evaluate the cause of her dyspnea, while a myositis-specific autoantibody panel can provide further information about the presence of an autoimmune-mediated process. These tests would be helpful in determining the underlying cause of her symptoms and guiding further management. Ordering testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody or anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies may be considered based on the clinical suspicion, but given the presentation, obtaining a chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel would be more appropriate initially. Performing a muscle biopsy would not be necessary at this point in the evaluation.

184
I would choose answer option B: Further surgical debridement.

Explanation: The patient's worsening necrotic wound, with a new purple dusky border and extensive neutrophilic inflammation on histologic examination, suggests progressive tissue necrosis and infection. Therefore, further surgical debridement is necessary to remove nonviable tissue and control the infection. This will help improve wound healing and prevent the spread of infection. Other interventions, such as intravenous antibiotics, are already being administered, but surgical debridement is essential in this case.

185
B: Check antinuclear antibody and complement levels

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and the presence of a nasal deformity, it is important to investigate the possibility of an underlying autoimmune condition. Checking antinuclear antibody (ANA) and complement levels can help determine if there is an autoimmune component contributing to the joint pain and nasal deformity. This will provide valuable information for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition.

D: Perform further thyroid function tests and thyroid imaging.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms include bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, diplopia, and restricted eye movements, which are suggestive of orbital inflammation. Given the patient's history of Crohn disease and recent medication change, it is important to rule out possible causes of orbital inflammation, including thyroid-related disease.

Performing further thyroid function tests and thyroid imaging will help assess the thyroid gland's involvement and exclude any associated thyroid abnormalities or malignancies. This will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition and guide appropriate management decisions.

C: Genetic testing. 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of multifocal macular lesions and the concern for either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM), it would be important to perform genetic testing. Genetic testing can help identify any specific genetic mutations or abnormalities that may be contributing to the development of the lesions. This information can help guide further management and treatment decisions.

Answer: D: Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye

Explanation: The patient's worsening angle closure symptoms in the left eye, along with the presence of macular and optic nerve edema, shifting subretinal fluid, and choroidal detachments indicate that laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) alone may not be sufficient to alleviate her symptoms. In this case, a clear lens exchange in the left eye can help address the underlying anatomical issue by removing the crystalline lens, which may be contributing to the angle closure and associated complications. This procedure can help restore normal anterior chamber depth and improve fluid dynamics in the eye, potentially resolving the subretinal fluid and improving the patient's vision.

189
I would choose answer option C: Perform ciliary body-choroidal biopsy in the right eye.

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, there are multiple potential diagnoses, including Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), lymphoproliferative disorders, and sarcoidosis. To further investigate and confirm the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous retinal detachment, a ciliary body-choroidal biopsy in the right eye would be the most appropriate next step.

Performing a biopsy would provide histopathological information that can help differentiate between these possible diagnoses and guide further treatment decisions. It would allow for a more targeted and specific approach, compared to other options such as diagnostic vitrectomy or intravitreal antibiotics, which may not provide as much information about the underlying cause of the patient's ocular manifestations. Systemic steroids can be considered once a definitive diagnosis is established.

C: Sjogren disease

Explanation: The patient's presentation of persistent bilateral oral ulceration, facial swelling, and the presence of non-caseating granulomatous inflammation on biopsy is consistent with Sjogren disease. Sjogren disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes. The extraoral examination showing bilateral buccal facial swelling and the intraoral examination showing scarring of the mandibular vestibule and aphthous ulcers further support this diagnosis.
D
191
The correct answer is B: Metastatic colon cancer.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with an unexplained lost voice, in combination with the presence of left vocal cord palsy and an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular, prevertebral, and paravertebral regions, suggests a metastatic process rather than a primary tumor. The nodal disease in the left supraclavicular region is suspicious for metastasis, and the involvement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve explains the vocal cord palsy. The primary site of disease is not apparent, but given the patient's age and absence of risk factors for head and neck cancer, it is less likely to be laryngeal, esophageal, or lymphoma. The patient's presentation is more consistent with metastatic disease, and since no other primary tumor is mentioned, the most likely source is colorectal cancer. A PET/CT scan with FDG tracer can be used to further evaluate and identify the primary site of disease.
B
192
Answer: B: Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis 

Explanation: Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is a rare disorder characterized by asymptomatic, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic papules with spiny projections. The lesions typically occur unilaterally and often progress proximally over time. In this case, the lesions were only present on the left side of the body, sparing the right side. The histologic findings of orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination are consistent with multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis. Other differential diagnoses such as lichen spinulosus, porokeratosis, and viral warts can be excluded based on the clinical and histologic features described.

The correct answer is D: Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical findings, including the presence of multiple millimetric erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules, symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples, and laboratory findings (hypocomplementemia, proteinuria, and positive autoantibodies) are consistent with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS). HUVS is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by skin lesions resembling urticaria, systemic involvement (such as arthralgias and asthenia), and histological evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. It is important to note that HUVS often presents with hypocomplementemia and autoantibodies targeting complement components. Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (choice A) usually presents with erythematous papules, plaques, and ulcerations, but without hypocomplementemia and the characteristic annular plaques seen in this patient. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome (choice B) presents with erythematous to purpuric papules and plaques, often with a histiocytic infiltrate, but without involvement of other organ systems. Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis (choice C) presents with erythematous papules and plaques with histological evidence of palisading granulomas, but without hypocomplementemia or systemic involvement.

I would choose answer option B: Consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery.

Explanation: The patient has developed severe mitral regurgitation (MR) as shown on the echocardiogram. This may be contributing to the pulmonary edema and low-flow alarms on the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) console. Consultation with cardiovascular surgery is necessary to discuss mitral valve surgery as a potential treatment option for the patient.

195
I would choose option D: OCT-angiography of the macula.

Explanation: Given the presentation of subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces within the macula in a patient with normal-tension glaucoma, it is important to assess the macular vasculature to rule out the possibility of neovascularization. OCT-angiography is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed visualization of retinal vasculature, allowing for the detection of any abnormal vascular activity in the macula. This would help determine if intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment is needed. Fluorescein angiography may also provide information about the retinal vasculature, but it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and may not be necessary in this case. OCT of the optic nerve head may provide additional information about the optic cup appearance, but it would not directly address the presence of subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces in the macula.

Based on the given clinical presentation and findings, the next appropriate step would be to choose Answer Option A: Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results.

Explanation: The patient's history of intravenous drug abuse and multiple sexual partners, along with the presence of bilateral hemorrhagic optic disc edema, suggests a possible infectious etiology. Given the risk factors, it is important to rule out infectious causes like HIV and syphilis, which can cause optic disc edema and hemorrhages. Obtaining specific serology tests for HIV and syphilis will help diagnose or rule out these potential infections, guiding further management and treatment.

197
I would choose option C: Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling.

Explanation: Given the worsening symptoms and the lack of improvement with the current therapy, it would be important to reassess the aqueous or vitreous samples for any missed infections or microbial growth. This is especially important since the initial cultures did not show any growth. Repeat sampling would help detect any potential infectious agents and guide further treatment decisions.

198
The diagnosis for this case is D: Venolymphatic malformation.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of a fluctuating, tender, and superficial mass in the right parotid gland, along with the presence of necrotic lymph nodes within the parotid gland, is suggestive of a venolymphatic malformation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showing a peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion further support this diagnosis.

Branchial cleft cysts typically present in the lateral neck region, while this patient's mass is specifically located in the parotid gland. Atypical mycobacterium infection would require specific risk factors or evidence of systemic infection, which are not present in this case. Chronic sialadenitis with abscess typically presents with chronic inflammation and abscess formation, which is not consistent with the patient's clinical course. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings is venolymphatic malformation.
B
199
The correct answer is B: Pseudo-aneurysmal metastasis of melanoma.

Explanation: The sudden development of indurated subcutaneous nodules in a patient with a recent melanoma surgical procedure raises concern for metastasis. The clinical image shows a nodule adjacent to a subtle linear plaque, which is consistent with a linear scar from the previous surgery. Histopathologic examination reveals dilated and thrombosed lymphatic vessels in the subcutaneous tissue, and immunohistochemistry is positive for D2-40, a marker of lymphatic endothelium. These findings support the diagnosis of pseudo-aneurysmal metastasis of melanoma, where malignant cells invade lymphatic vessels and induce thrombosis, causing nodular lesions to develop. This is an important diagnosis to consider in a patient with a history of melanoma and new subcutaneous nodules.

B: Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation

Explanation: The wide complex QRS seen during sotalol administration raises concern for a potential ventricular arrhythmia. Therefore, an electrophysiology study (EPS) should be performed to further evaluate the patient's cardiac conduction system. EPS can help identify any abnormal electrical pathways or arrhythmogenic foci that may be contributing to the patient's palpitations and arrhythmias. Catheter ablation can be performed during the EPS to target and eliminate these abnormal pathways or foci, providing definitive treatment for the patient's arrhythmias.

202
D: Perform a comprehensive systemic workup.

Explanation: Given the atypical presentation of the choroidal mass and the subsequent development of gingivitis and elevated white blood cell count, it is important to rule out any systemic underlying cause for the ocular findings. The negative blood test results thus far do not exclude the possibility of an underlying systemic condition, so a comprehensive systemic workup should be conducted to identify any potential underlying diseases or conditions that may be contributing to the ocular findings and systemic symptoms. This will help guide further management and treatment options.

203
The answer option would be C: Sequencing of titin gene.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including sensorineural hearing loss, cognitive impairment, poor coordination, muscle weakness, and elevated levels of lactic acid and pyruvate acid, along with the findings of biventricular hypertrophy and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, suggests a diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. MELAS syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Therefore, sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (option D) would be the most appropriate next step. Sequencing of myosin heavy chain gene (option A) would be more relevant to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a sarcomeric mutation, while sequencing of dystrophin gene (option B) would be more relevant to muscular dystrophy. Sequencing of titin gene (option C) is not as likely to be the cause of the patient's clinical presentation compared to mitochondrial DNA sequencing.

204
The answer is C: Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling following dental implant placement, along with the imaging findings of osteomyelitis of the mandible and inflammation of surrounding soft tissues, is most consistent with SAPHO syndrome. SAPHO syndrome is a rare condition characterized by aseptic osteitis (inflammation of the bone) that can involve the mandible, hyperostosis (excessive bone growth), and skin manifestations such as acne and pustulosis. The histopathologic image of the biopsy specimen in this case also shows aggregates of multinucleated giant cells, which further support the diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome. Other potential diagnoses such as actinomycosis, atypical vasculitis, and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis do not fit with the clinical presentation and findings in this case.
B
205
B: Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction.

Explanation: Given the patient's recent travel history and symptoms of fevers, night sweats, and myalgias, combined with the presence of vitritis and other ocular signs, it is important to consider the possibility of an infectious etiology. Obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can help identify any potential infectious agents causing the retinal detachment and other ocular findings. This will allow for appropriate treatment targeting the specific pathogen, if identified.

I would choose option D: Obtain thoracic lymph node biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's previous history of bilateral panuveitis, occlusive retinal periphlebitis, abdominal lymph nodes, and neurological symptoms, it is important to obtain a biopsy of the thoracic lymph nodes. This will help to further investigate the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, such as ruling out infectious or granulomatous etiologies. Additionally, the abnormal enhancement and hyperintensity seen on the magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and cauda equina nerve roots further support the need for a biopsy to guide diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

The answer is: A: Papulopustular rosacea.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent pustular eruptions on the face, exacerbated by sunlight, is characteristic of papulopustular rosacea. The typical distribution on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose, as well as the lack of systemic symptoms and negative autoimmune markers, further support this diagnosis. The punch biopsy findings of intrafollicular and subcorneal pustule formation are consistent with rosacea. Other options such as pinpoint papular light eruption, actinic folliculitis, and acute localized exanthematous pustulosis do not fit the clinical presentation and biopsy findings.
C

208
B: Sebaceous nevus

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple skin-colored, soft papules and nodules distributed along Blaschko lines is suggestive of a sebaceous nevus. Sebaceous nevi are congenital hamartomas that primarily involve sebaceous glands, resulting in the formation of hairless plaques or nodules. They typically grow as the patient grows and may exhibit spontaneous regression or exfoliation of pedunculated lesions. The presence of multiple hair follicles on the lesions further supports the diagnosis of a sebaceous nevus. The histopathological examination would reveal the presence of sebaceous glands and a fibrotic stroma.

The answer is C: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality.

Explanation: The reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) in this case suggests that there is an issue with the transfer of gas between the alveoli and the capillaries. This could be due to a problem with the thin alveolar-capillary membrane, which can limit the diffusion of gases. The normal forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume indicate that there is no significant impairment in lung function or obstruction of the airways. Hemoglobin levels alone do not account for the isolated reduction in Dlco. Therefore, the most likely explanation is an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality.

210
The correct answer is C: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, history of travel to an endemic area, and imaging findings are consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). EGPA, also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a rare systemic necrotizing vasculitis that predominantly affects small- to medium-sized vessels. Neurological involvement occurs in approximately 40% of cases, with the central nervous system (CNS) being affected in up to 30% of those cases.

The patient's symptoms of headache, dysarthria, double vision, and dizziness are indicative of CNS involvement. The MRI findings of a T2-weighted FLAIR hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons further support the diagnosis of EGPA. The absence of diffusion restriction or hemorrhages on imaging helps differentiate EGPA from other possible diagnoses.

The laboratory test results are also consistent with EGPA. The presence of eosinophilia, both in the total leukocyte count and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, is a characteristic feature of EGPA. The CSF analysis showing lymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes supports the diagnosis.

Given the patient's travel history to northeastern Brazil, where parasitic infections are common, neuroschistosomiasis may initially be considered a possible diagnosis. However, the absence of signs like hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, as well as the CSF analysis findings, make neuroschistosomiasis less likely.

Listeriosis is caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and typically presents with fever, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The absence of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea makes listeriosis an unlikely diagnosis in this case.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is characterized by optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings do not align with NMOSD.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome.

B: Perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry 

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical presentation, including the sudden onset of blurred vision and extensive retinal hemorrhage, raise concern for possible ocular involvement of the underlying disease. Vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry can help confirm the presence of lymphoma cells in the vitreous humor and guide further management. It can also differentiate between primary ocular lymphoma and systemic lymphoma with ocular involvement. This information will be crucial for deciding on the appropriate treatment approach and prognosis for the patient.

D: Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

Explanation: Given the presence of enlarged, morphologically abnormal axillary lymph nodes on the MRI, it is necessary to perform a right axillary ultrasound now to evaluate the lymph nodes further. Biopsy of the enlarged lymph nodes can help determine whether there is any involvement of the lymph nodes by the breast cancer. This information is crucial for appropriate staging and treatment planning. Delaying the ultrasound for 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination may not be ideal as it can delay the diagnosis and potentially impact the treatment decisions.

I would choose answer option B: Perform a bone biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, along with an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, suggests the possibility of a bone-related pathology. Given her history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and kidney transplant, it is important to consider the possibility of underlying bone disease, such as osteitis fibrosa cystica or osteomalacia.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits

Explanation: The presence of subacute-onset blurry vision, floaters, mild headache, and peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages in a patient with refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) suggests the possibility of leukemic infiltration in the optic nerve (Leukemic optic neuropathy). In this case, it is important to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as central nervous system involvement or compressive lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits can help identify any structural abnormalities, such as optic nerve infiltration or compression. Prompt referral for MRI can guide further management decisions and optimize the patient's visual prognosis.

The correct answer is C: Perform lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid contents.

Explanation: The patient presents with visual symptoms suggestive of homonymous hemianopia. Neuroimaging with CT initially appeared normal but subsequent review of the MRI revealed abnormal findings involving the left occipital cortex. These findings suggest a possible neurological cause for the visual symptoms. To further investigate the underlying cause, a lumbar puncture should be performed to assess the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents. This can help identify any inflammatory or infectious processes that may be affecting the brain. Measurement of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (option A) may be useful in diagnosing systemic inflammation but may not specifically address the underlying neurological cause. Measurement of blood glucose levels (option B) may be relevant in certain cases, such as suspected hypoglycemia, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient. Magnetic resonance angiography (option D) may be considered later on to evaluate the blood vessels of the head, but it is not the most immediate or necessary investigation at this point.

216
B: Perform excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy.

Explanation: Given the characteristics of the mass, including its gradual growth, tenderness, and lack of other associated symptoms, it is important to rule out malignancy. A definitive diagnosis can only be achieved through biopsy, which involves removing the lesion and examining it under a microscope. Although conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage may be considered for certain benign lesions, in this case, with the suspicion of malignancy, it is prudent to proceed with excisional biopsy for further evaluation. Incision and drainage would not be appropriate as the lesion appears subcutaneous and noncompressible. Observation without further investigation could delay appropriate diagnosis and treatment if the mass is indeed malignant.

A: Transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve for grading and immunohistochemistry

Explanation: Given the progressive nature of the optic nerve lesion and the lack of response to initial treatment, it is important to obtain a tissue diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the lesion and guide further management. Transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve can provide the necessary tissue for grading and immunohistochemistry, which are crucial in determining the specific diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.

The correct answer is C: Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp.

Explanation: The patient presents with an asymptomatic arc-shaped furrow on the forehead and linear alopecia on the left side of the scalp, which gradually progressed over 10 years. Dermoscopic examination revealed short vellus hairs, yellow dots, and honeycomb hyperpigmentation, consistent with scarring alopecia. Histopathologic findings showed lymphocytic infiltrates in perifollicular and periappendageal regions of the dermis and lobular panniculitis with hyaline fat necrosis in the subcutis, which are characteristic of lupus erythematosus panniculitis. Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp is a rare subtype of lupus erythematosus that presents with linear or arc-shaped furrows, alopecia, and panniculitis. It is important to differentiate this condition from other causes of linear alopecia, such as linear atrophoderma of Moulin and linear discoid lupus erythematosus. Localized lipodystrophy typically presents with adipose tissue loss and is not consistent with the clinicopathologic findings in this case.

219
The answer is B: Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of painful oral erosions along with a mediastinal mass and hypogammaglobulinemia is suggestive of thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Thymoma is often associated with autoimmune disorders, including oral lichenoid lesions. The histopathologic features of the tongue biopsy, with acanthosis, necrotic keratinocytes, and lymphocytic infiltrate, also support this diagnosis. The excised mediastinal mass confirmed the presence of a thymoma, further supporting the diagnosis.

Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option C). 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath along with T wave inversions on the electrocardiogram suggests a possible cardiac pathology. Since the patient's initial tests including complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and cardiac troponins were normal, it is important to further investigate the underlying cause.

A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed images of the heart and its structures. It can help evaluate the function, structure, and blood flow within the heart. In this case, a cardiac MRI can help identify any structural abnormalities or ischemic changes in the heart, such as cardiomyopathy or evidence of coronary artery disease. This would be the most appropriate test to further evaluate the patient's condition and guide further management.
D: Secondary syphilis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the acute onset of weakness in the lower limbs, ascending numbness, extensor plantar responses, and sensory level at T6, is consistent with acute myelopathy. The elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid and the T2 hyperintensity observed on the thoracic spine MRI suggest inflammation and involvement of the spinal cord. 

The description of the papular skin eruption, with hypopigmented papules and central hyperpigmented umbilication, along with larger papules with atrophic porcelain white scarring, is consistent with the characteristic rash seen in secondary syphilis. Secondary syphilis can involve multiple organ systems, including the nervous system, causing symptoms such as myelopathy. 

The extensive workup for malignancy and other systemic autoimmune diseases being negative further supports the diagnosis of secondary syphilis.

A: Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of arthralgias, eye pain, and skin rash are concerning for a possible systemic vasculitis. Checking ANCA titers can help in the evaluation for conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis, which can present with similar symptoms. ANCA-associated vasculitides typically present with multisystem involvement, including the respiratory tract, kidneys, and skin.
A

223
Option C: Recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates, along with the presence of posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, the initial concern was that she may have had an infection such as group A streptococcal infection (which was initially suspected due to the negative rapid strep test), or infectious mononucleosis (which was suspected due to the white tonsillar exudates and lymphadenopathy). However, the negative throat culture result and lack of improvement with antibiotics raises doubts about these initial suspicions.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, rechecking the rapid heterophile antibody test for infectious mononucleosis would be the appropriate next step. This test can help confirm or rule out the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis. If the test is positive, it would support the diagnosis and indicate that the patient needs supportive care for the viral infection. If the test is negative, it would suggest that another cause for the patient's symptoms should be investigated further.

I would choose option C: Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. 

Explanation: The presentation of ocular and periocular pain, photophobia, conjunctival hyperemia, ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare, keratic precipitates, vitritis, and optic disc swelling suggests a possible inflammatory process in the eye. However, the increased serum creatinine level suggests the need to evaluate for systemic involvement, particularly renal involvement, which can be associated with certain types of uveitis. Ordering an MRI of the brain and orbits can help identify any underlying systemic or intraocular cause for the uveitis and optic disc swelling, such as granulomatous inflammation, infectious etiologies, or other structural abnormalities. This will help guide further management and treatment decisions for the patient.

I would choose option C: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of diplopia, ptosis, drooling, and history of persistent facial pain, it is important to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain that might be contributing to her symptoms. An MRI of the brain with contrast can provide detailed imaging of the cranial nerves, brainstem, and surrounding structures, helping to identify any potential causes such as compression or inflammation. This would be a non-invasive and comprehensive imaging modality that can provide valuable information for further diagnosis and management.

C: Laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease

Explanation: Given the patient's history of HIV and unprotected sexual contact, as well as the bilateral eye redness and pain that has been present for 6 months, a laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune diseases is warranted. The symptoms could potentially be related to an opportunistic infection or an autoimmune condition, so further testing should be done to determine the underlying cause. Starting oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroids without identifying the underlying cause would not be the most appropriate initial step. Starting topical corticosteroids would also not be indicated as the first step without further investigation.

I would choose answer option C: Biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the sudden enlargement of the cystic iris stromal lesion, the presence of blood at the pupillary margin, and the distortion of the pupil, suggest a serious underlying condition that requires further investigation. A biopsy would help determine the nature of the lesion and whether it is benign or malignant. This information would guide the appropriate management plan for the patient.

B: Treatment with topical and oral antibiotics

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings of conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon in the left eye, along with the history of infection and the previous diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis in the right eye, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate treatment with topical and oral antibiotics. This approach would help address the infectious etiology and prevent any potential further spread of infection.

Based on the presented information and the accompanying images, the most likely diagnosis is B: Calciphylaxis.

Explanation: Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by the calcification of small-to-medium-sized blood vessels in the skin and fatty subcutaneous tissues. It is commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease, though it can also be associated with other conditions such as cholangiocarcinoma.

The clinical presentation typically includes painful purpuric skin lesions that rapidly progress to necrotic ulcerations, as seen in the provided images. Laboratory findings may include elevated phosphorus levels, abnormal coagulation parameters (e.g., prolonged prothrombin time), and elevated D-dimer levels, as seen in this patient.

Histopathologic analysis, as shown in the biopsy specimen, can demonstrate calcium deposits within the blood vessel walls and pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like changes with fragmented calcified elastic fibers in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

Treatment of calciphylaxis involves addressing the underlying causes, optimizing wound care, pain management, and managing associated risk factors, such as hyperphosphatemia. In this case, initiation of rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, is not the appropriate treatment for calciphylaxis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Calciphylaxis.

The correct answer is A: Kaposi sarcoma.
Explanation: The clinical presentation of violaceous plaques, subcutaneous nodules, and swelling on the left lower extremity, along with the histopathologic findings of proliferation of superficial and deep vessels with thickening of the endothelium, are consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is a low-grade vascular tumor most commonly associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection, although other immunosuppression-related states can also contribute. In this case, the patient's otherwise healthy status and absence of HIV, as well as negative blood work and prothrombin, make the diagnosis of classical Kaposi sarcoma more likely. Treatment options for Kaposi sarcoma include local interventions, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
B
cellvalue empty
231
Based on the provided information and the histopathological and microbiological examination results, the most likely diagnosis is C: Phaeohyphomycosis.

Explanation: Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by various species of dematiaceous fungi, characterized by the presence of pigmented or dark hyphae (phaeohyphae) in the affected tissues. The clinical presentation in this case, including the presence of multiple painless nodules on the cheek, along with the histopathological findings of epithelioid cell granulomas and fungal profiles within giant cells, are consistent with phaeohyphomycosis.

Cutaneous aspergillosis, another fungal infection, is less likely in this case as the histopathological examination did not show septate hyphae, which is characteristic of Aspergillus species.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is also a possibility given the patient's history of respiratory symptoms, but the histopathological findings of fungal profiles within the giant cells make phaeohyphomycosis a more likely diagnosis.

Entomophthoromycosis, a rare fungal infection caused by fungi belonging to the order Entomophthorales, can present with similar clinical features but is typically associated with an immunocompromised state, which the patient in this case is not experiencing.

It's important to note that a definitive diagnosis would require further microbiological culture to identify the specific fungal species causing the infection.

A: Perform a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass.

Explanation: The patient presents with multiple systemic lesions, including a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery. The presence of a mass in the lung with infiltration into the pulmonary artery raises concern for malignancy, particularly in a patient with a previous history of lymphoma. A thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass would be necessary to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further management. This option allows for a minimally invasive approach to obtain tissue for histopathological evaluation. Once the biopsy results are available, appropriate treatment strategies, such as chemotherapy or surgical resection, can be considered based on the pathology findings.
D

233
The answer option is A: Place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of upper back pain, cough, and fever, along with the imaging findings of consolidation in the left lower lobe of the lung and spinal cord compression, the most likely diagnosis is tuberculosis (TB) with vertebral involvement, also known as Pott's disease. 

TB is an airborne infectious disease, and thus placing the patient in airborne isolation is necessary to prevent the spread to others. The recommended treatment for TB includes a combination of four drugs: ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. This regimen should be started as soon as possible to minimize disease progression and complications. 

Options B, C, and D are not appropriate in this case as they do not address the underlying diagnosis of TB with vertebral involvement.
A
cellvalue empty
234
The answer is A: Results are consistent with axonal polyneuropathy.

Explanation: The NCS results show reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) in all tested nerves, indicating a loss of sensory axons. Additionally, there is evidence of reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitudes, suggesting motor axon involvement. These findings support the diagnosis of axonal polyneuropathy.

The needle EMG findings are important for ruling out other conditions. In this case, the absence of fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in the sampled muscles suggests that there is no ongoing denervation, which is consistent with axonal polyneuropathy rather than demyelinating polyneuropathy.

Polyradiculopathy typically presents with symptoms of nerve root involvement, such as radicular pain and muscle weakness in a dermatomal distribution. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a distal symmetric sensorimotor neuropathy, rather than radiculopathy.

The normal values for nerve conduction parameters vary depending on the laboratory and reference values used, but based on the given results, it is clear that there is abnormality (reduced amplitudes) in both sensory and motor nerves. Therefore, the results are not normal.

B: Discontinue minocycline.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of blue-black skin pigmentation, along with blue discoloration of the sclerae and teeth, is consistent with minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation. Minocycline is known to cause blue-gray pigmentation of the skin, mucous membranes, and teeth due to its deposition in various tissues, including the skin and sclerae. Discontinuation of minocycline is recommended in cases of drug-induced hyperpigmentation. The other answer options (A, C, and D) are not relevant to the patient's presentation and do not explain the observed pigmentation.

I would recommend empirical treatment with option C: Voriconazole. 

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation, with a history of swimming in a freshwater lake and worsening symptoms despite initial treatment, there is a suspicion for a fungal keratitis. The diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal infiltrate seen on IVCM are consistent with a fungal infection. Empirical treatment with Voriconazole, a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, is appropriate while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures. Empirical treatment aims to cover the most common pathogens and should be adjusted based on culture results if needed.

I would choose option C: Observation.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with glaucoma who has new-onset macular schisis in her left eye. The visual acuity is slightly worse in the left eye, and there is a small area of distortion on Amsler grid testing. However, the intraocular pressures are normal, and there are no other significant findings.

At this point, observation would be appropriate to monitor the progression of the macular schisis and evaluate if any further intervention is necessary. Surgical options like pars plana vitrectomy or laser barricade may be considered if the schisis worsens or if there are associated complications. However, as this is a new finding in the patient, it would be prudent to observe and reassess before considering invasive interventions.

Genetic testing for the RS1 gene may be indicated in cases of retinoschisis, but it is not mentioned in the provided case. Therefore, it is not a immediate choice for further management.

The correct answer is D: Genetic testing to rule out Stargardt disease.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of bilateral macular atrophy, symmetrical loss of autofluorescence in the macula and surrounding optic disc, and atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium on optical coherence tomography are consistent with Stargardt disease. Stargardt disease is a genetic disorder that affects the retina and results in progressive vision loss. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis and identify specific mutations in the ABCA4 gene, which is associated with Stargardt disease. It is important to rule out Stargardt disease in this case, as it is a hereditary condition that may have implications for genetic counseling and management.

B: Perform a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan.

Explanation: Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a rare condition that can be associated with an underlying systemic illness. Given the sudden vision loss in the right eye and subsequent amaurosis fugax episodes in the left eye, it is important to consider a potential underlying life-threatening condition. The normal results of the hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup suggest that the cause of the bilateral CRVO is likely systemic rather than localized. Performing a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan can help identify any underlying pathology, such as a tumor or thrombus, that may be contributing to the CRVO. This will guide further management and treatment options.
B

240
The answer is C: Angiosarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's history of retinoblastoma and previous radiotherapy increases her risk for developing secondary malignancies, including angiosarcomas. The presence of a firm, nonpitting edema extending to the hip, along with a mass seen on computed tomography venogram, suggests vascular involvement. Angiosarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. They can occur in various locations, including the extremities. In this case, the mass extending into the right common iliac vein is consistent with angiosarcoma. The other answer options, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and hemangioendothelioma, do not fit the clinical presentation or location of the mass.

241
Answer: C: Parathyroid cyst

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a compressive neck mass, dyspnea while supine, and fatigue, in combination with imaging findings of a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion lateral to the right thyroid gland, suggest a parathyroid cyst. The clear fluid aspirated during fine-needle aspiration with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL supports this diagnosis. The absence of communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus on barium swallow study excludes a branchial cleft cyst. A thyroglossal duct cyst would typically be located more centrally in the neck and communicates with the base of the tongue. A cystic thyroid nodule would typically have enhancing components on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan and may be associated with thyroid hormone abnormalities. Excision of the cyst and thyroid lobectomy were necessary due to the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe.
C
242
D: Benign teratoma

Explanation: The patient's history of recently treated testicular cancer indicates a potential for metastasis. However, the presentation of a rapidly enlarging neck mass, which initially decreased in size during chemotherapy, suggests that this is not a latent metastasis. The characteristics of the mass on MRI and CT scans, including cystic components, septations, and modularity, are consistent with a benign teratoma. The growing teratoma syndrome, characterized by the growth of teratomas despite chemotherapy treatment, is a possibility but less likely in this case given that the patient's neck mass appears to be a new occurrence and not related to the original tumor site.
C
243
C: Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx 

Explanation: The patient's history of allo-SCT for mutated AML, the diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours and myeloid markers positivity (CD33, CD43, CD7, myeloperoxidase), are all consistent with extramedullary myeloid sarcoma. This is a rare manifestation of AML, characterized by the presence of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow. In this case, the involvement of the larynx presents as hoarseness and stridor. Squamous cell carcinoma, graft-vs-host disease, and marginal zone lymphoma are less likely given the clinical and histologic findings.
C
244
B: Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma 

Explanation: The patient's history of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma, along with the characteristic skin findings of widespread erythematous plaques with prominent telangiectases, strongly suggest intravascular involvement by the lymphoma. The biopsy showing CD56 immunostaining labeling intravascular atypical cells further supports this diagnosis. This is a known presentation of NK/T-cell lymphoma, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with disease progression.

245
I would choose option C: Change the LV pacing configuration.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's worsening cardiomyopathy and alternating QRS morphologies on ECG suggest that there may be suboptimal LV pacing. Changing the LV pacing configuration can help optimize ventricular pacing and potentially improve the patient's symptoms. This can be done by adjusting the pacing vector or reprogramming the pacemaker. Other options such as suppressing premature ventricular contractions, increasing the basal pacing rate, or referring for LV lead repositioning may also be considered depending on the individual patient's clinical presentation and needs.
C

246
The correct answer is A: Giant cell arteritis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of multiple progressive ulcers limited to the right half of the face, accompanied by burning sensation and hypoesthesia, is consistent with trigeminal involvement. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein concentration suggest an inflammatory process. Given the patient's age and the presence of neurological symptoms, giant cell arteritis is the most likely diagnosis. The brainstem involvement seen on MRI is consistent with a posterior circulation stroke, which can be a complication of giant cell arteritis. Trigeminal herpes zoster typically presents with a vesicular rash rather than ulcers. Trigeminal trophic syndrome is characterized by self-inflicted ulcers due to insensitivity to pain. Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerative condition associated with underlying systemic diseases, but it does not typically involve the trigeminal nerve.
C

247
I would choose answer option D: Check antiphospholipid antibody levels.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of retinal artery thrombosis and aortic valve vegetations, along with the positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at low titer and positive dsDNA, it is important to investigate the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can lead to recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis. 

Checking antiphospholipid antibody levels would help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of APS, guiding further management decisions. Treatment for APS usually involves a combination of anticoagulant therapy to prevent further thrombotic events and sometimes immunosuppressive therapy, such as systemic corticosteroids, if there are significant autoimmune manifestations. However, since the patient has already presented with thrombotic events, it is important to determine the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies before initiating treatment.
D
cellvalue empty
248
Answer: C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast

Explanation: The patient's presentation of limited eye movements, ptosis, and diplopia suggests an oculomotor nerve palsy. The oculomotor nerve controls the movements of the eye and eyelid, and its involvement can result in these specific findings. The absence of additional neurological symptoms, normal findings on physical examination, and preserved visual acuity suggest that this is a localized cranial nerve issue rather than a more systemic neurological problem.

Given the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast. This would help to identify any structural abnormalities or lesions that could be causing the oculomotor nerve palsy. Imaging the orbits specifically would provide more detailed information about the surrounding structures and nerves involved, helping to guide further management if needed.

249
D: Continue acetazolamide and repeated Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months.

Explanation:
This patient presents with bilateral disc edema, visual loss, tinnitus, severe intermittent headaches, and elevated protein on lumbar puncture. The initial workup, including imaging studies and serologies, did not reveal any specific diagnosis. The fundus examination 4 months later shows optic nerve pallor without edema, indicating that the previous edema has resolved. 

Given the improvement in visual acuity and the absence of edema, it is reasonable to continue acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, and monitor the patient with repeated visual field testing and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months. This will help assess for any progression or stability of the optic nerve damage and aid in further management decisions.

Options A and C (tighter blood pressure control and high-dose corticosteroids) are not indicated based on the given information. Option B (repeated lumbar puncture with serologies) is not necessary since the initial serologies were normal and the elevated protein on lumbar puncture is likely secondary to increased intracranial pressure.

A: Send for infectious and inflammatory tests and follow up within 1 week.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe headaches and progressive bilateral vision loss, along with the presence of chorioretinal lesions, suggest an inflammatory etiology. At this point, it would be prudent to send the patient for infectious and inflammatory tests to help identify the underlying cause. The follow-up within 1 week allows for timely evaluation of the test results and further management.

251
C: Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the development of acute kidney injury following immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, suggests a potential renal complication related to melanoma metastasis. The kidney biopsy findings further support the diagnosis, showing atypical cells in kidney capillaries and melanin-A staining. This is consistent with metastatic melanoma involving the kidneys and causing acute tubular necrosis, which has led to anuric kidney failure in this case. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced acute interstitial nephritis is less likely given the biopsy findings and lack of improvement with high dose steroids. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis and drug-induced acute tubular necrosis are not consistent with the patient's clinical history and biopsy findings.
C

252
The correct answer is D: EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU). EBVMCU is a rare condition characterized by non-healing ulcers that are typically found in the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and skin. It is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, as indicated by the positive IgG for EBV in this case. However, the absence of IgM for EBV suggests a past infection rather than an acute viral process.

The presence of multiple shallow ulcers in the pharynx, along with a large defect involving the entire soft palate without an obvious mass, is consistent with the diagnosis of EBVMCU. The smooth and clean edges of the soft palate defect indicate an ulcerative process rather than a malignant or invasive lesion.

Laboratory investigations, including autoimmune antibody tests, HIV screening, and syphilis screening, were negative, ruling out other potential causes of the ulcers. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of thickening and hyperenhancement around the edges of the defect further support the diagnosis of EBVMCU.

Biopsies taken from the ulcers and edges of the soft palate defect will provide histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis. The characteristic findings on histology include a dense inflammatory infiltrate and evidence of ulceration without significant atypia or malignancy.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis in this case is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (D).
D
253
The correct answer is A: Medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Explanation: The histologic examination of the right thyroid lesion showed an organoid zellballen pattern, which is characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) of the thyroid gland. These cells produce calcitonin, a hormone involved in calcium homeostasis. MTC can present as a sporadic form or as part of hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome.

In this case, the patient had a history of a 2-month neck mass associated with hoarseness of voice and globus sensation, which are common symptoms of MTC. The physical examination showed thyromegaly with a dominant nodule in the right lobe. The ultrasonography findings also supported the diagnosis of MTC with the presence of a suspect left level IV lymph node.

The ancillary testing, including immunohistochemistry for calcitonin and genetic testing for the RET proto-oncogene mutation, would further confirm the diagnosis of MTC.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, histologic examination, and characteristic features of MTC, the correct answer is A: Medullary thyroid carcinoma.
D
254
The correct answer is C: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.

Explanation: The presentation of indurated plaques with telangiectasias on the lower limbs, along with the histopathology findings of large round cells proliferating within dermal blood vessels, suggests a diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. This rare type of lymphoma primarily involves the blood vessels and can present with cutaneous manifestations. Other options, such as intralymphatic histiocytosis, reactive angioendotheliomatosis, and intralymphatic proliferation of T-cell lymphoid blasts, are not consistent with the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

The correct answer is D: Blau syndrome.

Explanation: Blau syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the triad of persistent granulomatous dermatitis, arthritis, and uveitis. It usually presents in early childhood with erythematous papules and plaques on the skin, joint pain and swelling, and uveitis. Histological examination of skin biopsies shows noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and neutrophil infiltration. Blau syndrome is caused by mutations in the NOD2 gene, which is involved in the regulation of the immune system. Treatment typically involves immunosuppressive therapy.

256
I would choose option D: Start an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presents with hypotension, exertional dyspnea, diffuse ST-segment elevation on ECG, and an intracardiac mass. These findings suggest the presence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with cardiogenic shock. In this situation, the most appropriate initial intervention is to start an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). 

The IABP is a mechanical device that helps to improve cardiac output and perfusion to vital organs by increasing coronary perfusion and reducing cardiac workload. It does so by inflating during diastole to augment coronary blood flow and deflating during systole to reduce left ventricular afterload. 

Administering dobutamine (option A) is not appropriate for this patient as she already has hypotension, and dobutamine can further decrease systemic vascular resistance, worsening the hypotension. 

Administering nitrates and nifedipine (option B) is not appropriate as these medications are mainly used to reduce cardiac preload and afterload and are not the first-line treatment for cardiogenic shock. 

Administering bisoprolol (option C) is contraindicated in this patient as it can worsen hypotension and negatively impact cardiac output. 

In summary, given the clinical presentation of acute MI with cardiogenic shock, initiating an intra-aortic balloon pump (option D) is the most appropriate next step to improve cardiac function and hemodynamics.

A: Perform vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics

Explanation: The patient presents with a white macular lesion, disc edema, hemorrhages, and vascular sheathing, which are indicative of an infectious or inflammatory process. The presence of vitreous cells and debris on optical coherence tomography further supports the possibility of an intraocular infection. The next appropriate step would be to perform a vitreous tap to obtain a sample for culture and sensitivity testing, and to inject intravitreal antibiotics to treat any potential intraocular infection.

C: Obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram.

Explanation:
Before making a decision on the most appropriate management strategy, it would be beneficial to obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram (OCT) to assess the corneal structure and detect any potential underlying pathologies, such as Descemet's membrane detachment or irregularities in the corneal endothelium. This imaging modality provides detailed cross-sectional images of the cornea, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the underlying cause of the corneal edema. The results of the OCT can help guide the subsequent management approach.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be:

C: Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with unilateral frosted branch angiitis (FBA), a rare form of retinal vasculitis that is often associated with systemic vasculitis or viral infections. Given the patient's history of immunosuppression and digital ischemia, it is important to evaluate for potential underlying infectious etiologies. Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry can help identify any abnormalities in the blood cells, such as atypical lymphocytes or viral particles, which may suggest an infectious cause. This can help guide further management and treatment options. Escalating systemic immunosuppression or performing a diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet may be considered later depending on the results of the peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry. Whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is not indicated at this stage as there is no evidence to suggest systemic involvement beyond the ocular findings.

260
A: Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma

Explanation: The patient's presentation with widespread, rapidly growing, asymptomatic skin nodules, along with the histologic findings of diffuse dermal infiltrates characterized by immature myeloid cells, is consistent with aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level further supports this diagnosis. Cutaneous lymphoma typically presents with different clinical features, such as plaques or patches, and has distinct histologic findings. Lepromatous leprosy is characterized by hypopigmented macules and nodules with nerve involvement. Sarcoidosis typically presents with granulomatous inflammation, which is not seen in this patient's biopsy findings.

261
The answer is C: Sclerosing polycystic adenoma.

Explanation: The gross examination of the excised parotid mass showed a well-circumscribed tan-white lesion surrounded by salivary gland tissue. Microscopic examination revealed a multilobulated complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change. These findings are consistent with sclerosing polycystic adenoma. Acinic cell carcinoma would typically show malignant features such as invasion, while mammary analog secretory carcinoma and myoepithelial carcinoma are more rare and less likely in this age group.
C
262
B: Herpes simplex virus infection

Explanation: The clinical presentation of tender perianal ulcers with a clean base is consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Here are some supporting points for this diagnosis:

1. Patient history: The patient has a recent history of immunosuppression due to a kidney transplant and was recently treated with systemic corticosteroids. Immunosuppressed individuals are at higher risk for HSV reactivation.

2. Clinical findings: The presence of multiple, tender perianal ulcers with a clean base is a classic presentation of HSV infection. The ulcers are typically well-demarcated and often have a punched-out appearance.

3. Histopathology: The biopsy findings of enlarged fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions are consistent with HSV infection.

Other potential diagnoses can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and negative test results. For example, amebiasis cutis typically presents with ulcerating plaques, and the histopathologic findings of large fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions are not characteristic of this condition. Similarly, cytomegalovirus infection and cutaneous Crohn disease would have different clinical and histopathologic features.

263
The correct answer is C: Lupus vulgaris.

Explanation: Lupus vulgaris is a chronic progressive form of cutaneous tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It typically presents as single or multiple brown plaques with a violaceous border, often affecting the face, particularly the nose and cheeks, but can also occur in other areas of the body. The lesions are characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, as observed in the histopathologic evaluation in this case. The presence of a positive Mantoux test and the lack of microorganisms on stainings further support the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris. This condition usually occurs in individuals with a delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response to M. tuberculosis, often with a long latency period between the initial infection and the development of clinical symptoms.

264
C: Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation

Explanation: The wide QRS complex rhythm in a teenager with recurrent palpitations and headaches suggests the possibility of a potential arrhythmia. Since the physical examination and echocardiography results were normal, it is important to further evaluate the cause of these symptoms. An electrophysiology study can help identify the underlying cause of the arrhythmia and guide further management. Catheter ablation may be considered as a potential treatment option if an arrhythmogenic focus or accessory pathway is identified during the study.
C
cellvalue empty
265
C: Measure serum niacin level

Explanation: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings of glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base, along with her poor appetite and weight loss, the most likely diagnosis is pellagra, a niacin deficiency. Pellagra is characterized by the "4 Ds" - dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death (if left untreated). The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and rash are consistent with this diagnosis.

To confirm the diagnosis, measuring serum niacin level would be the most appropriate next step. A low serum niacin level would confirm the deficiency and support the diagnosis of pellagra.

Measuring fecal calprotectin level (option A) is used to assess intestinal inflammation and would be more appropriate in cases of inflammatory bowel disease. Checking for fecal ova and parasites (option B) would be indicated if there were symptoms and signs suggestive of parasitic infection, such as bloody diarrhea or travel history to endemic areas. Testing for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (option D) would be appropriate if celiac disease was suspected, but the patient's symptoms and rash are not consistent with celiac disease.
C
cellvalue empty
266
C: Obtain serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral dull conjunctival reflexes, bulbar conjunctival lesions, patchy interpalpebral results on lissamine green staining, and clinically significant punctate epithelial erosions of the cornea with fluorescein staining suggests the possibility of ocular surface involvement due to autoimmune disease. The serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests can help identify the presence of Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can cause dry eyes and ocular surface abnormalities. This information will aid in determining the underlying cause of the nonhealing epithelial defect and guide appropriate treatment.
D
cellvalue empty
267
B: Perform staged bilateral orbital decompressions

Explanation: Given the patient's history of progressive bilateral proptosis and conjunctival erythema, along with the finding of marked enlargement of all extraocular muscles on the orbital CT scan, staged bilateral orbital decompressions would be the most appropriate next step in management.

The presence of bilateral proptosis and enlargement of all extraocular muscles suggests the possibility of thyroid eye disease (also known as Graves' ophthalmopathy), which is a common cause of proptosis and extraocular muscle enlargement. Staged bilateral orbital decompressions involve surgically removing some of the orbital bone to create more space for the enlarged extraocular muscles, thereby reducing proptosis and relieving compressive symptoms.

High-dose intravenous steroids may be considered as an initial treatment option for acute exacerbations of thyroid eye disease, but in this case, the patient's symptoms have been progressive over a 6-month period, suggesting a chronic process. Steroids alone may not provide sufficient long-term relief.

Performing extraocular muscle biopsy would not be the first step because the clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with thyroid eye disease. Biopsy is typically reserved for cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or other etiologies are suspected.

Referring for bilateral orbital external beam radiation may be considered as a treatment option for severe cases of thyroid eye disease that are refractory to other interventions, but it is not typically the first choice of treatment and is usually reserved for cases with more severe proptosis, optic nerve compression, or intractable diplopia.

D: Recommend a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of worsening floaters, decreased visual acuity, vitreous cell, floaters, and cystoid macular edema in both eyes, along with the presence of an enhancing mass in the right middle cranial fossa, expanding the Meckel cave and abutting the right trigeminal nerve, a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy would be recommended. This is crucial to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate management for the underlying pathology causing the visual symptoms and neurological findings.

269
I would choose option C: Start systemic corticosteroids.

Explanation: The child presented with left periocular edema and erythema, along with a known large retinoblastoma tumor and exudative retinal detachment. The orbital computed tomography scan showed preseptal and periorbital soft tissue swelling and edema. Given the clinical presentation and findings, it is likely that the orbital swelling is related to an inflammatory response following intra-arterial chemotherapy.

Starting systemic corticosteroids can help reduce the inflammation and swelling in the orbit. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties and can help alleviate symptoms such as swelling and erythema. This treatment may also help improve the child's overall clinical condition, including the fever and poor oral intake.

Options A and B are not warranted in this case as there is no evidence of bacterial infection based on blood culture testing, and examination under anesthesia may be reserved for further evaluation or interventions if needed.

Option D of observing may not be appropriate given the significant symptoms and clinical findings, and prompt intervention with systemic corticosteroids may be necessary to address the inflammation.

The diagnosis is C: Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of tender erythematous plaques and nodules in the distal limbs, palms, and soles, which progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk, along with the histopathological findings of a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the deeper dermis, around appendage structures, and into the interstitium, are indicative of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. This is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that can occur in the setting of malignancy, particularly leukemia. The patient's recent bone marrow biopsy findings of morphological remission support the diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis as a dermatological manifestation associated with his underlying acute leukemia.

271
I am an intelligent assistant and not a doctor, but based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis seems to be C: Angioneurotic edema. 

Explanation: Angioneurotic edema (also known as Quincke edema) is a condition characterized by sudden swelling of the skin and underlying tissues, typically involving the face, lips, tongue, throat, and sometimes the extremities. It is caused by an allergic reaction or an abnormal immune response, leading to the release of histamine and other chemicals that cause blood vessels to leak fluid into the surrounding tissues.

In this case, the patient presented with bilateral neck swelling that had developed over 24 hours, along with edema of the lower lip. The swelling was painless and had no traumatic or iatrogenic triggers. The absence of dyspnea, dysphagia, and fever further supports the diagnosis of angioneurotic edema. The normal airway and absence of trismus on nasofibroscopy and oropharyngeal examination also suggest that there is no obstruction.

However, please note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a healthcare professional after a thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms and medical history, along with appropriate diagnostic tests. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
B
272
D: Spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, neck swelling, and ecchymosis, is suggestive of an acute airway obstruction. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography reveals a large, obstructive, submucosal lesion in the upper airway, extending from the nasopharynx to the glottis. These findings, along with the patient's coagulopathy (elevated international normalized ratio and prothrombin time), suggest a spontaneous airway hemorrhage with an obstructive hematoma. This condition can result from spontaneous rupture of small vessels in the upper airway or trauma to blood vessels within the upper airway, especially in patients on anticoagulation therapy. The decision to proceed with awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation indicates the urgency and severity of the airway obstruction.
D
273
The correct answer is C: Follicular mucinous nevus.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple follicular papules in a linear distribution on the face is suggestive of a follicular nevus. The histopathological features shown in Figure 1B and C, which were not described in the given information, would further support this diagnosis. Lichen striatus typically presents as a linear eruption of papules or plaques following the lines of Blaschko. Idiopathic follicular mucinosis is characterized by the accumulation of mucin within the hair follicles, usually presenting as pink to yellow papules or plaques, often involving the face. Trichodysplasia spinulosa, which is caused by the trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus, presents as numerous flesh-colored to brown spiny follicular papules, usually in the central face.

274
The correct answer is B: Neurocristic hamartoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque with hypertrichosis in a child, along with the presence of blue-gray patches and a café au lait macule, is suggestive of neurocristic hamartoma. Neurocristic hamartoma is a rare benign cutaneous hamartoma that arises from neural crest cells, typically presenting in early childhood. It is characterized by multinodular plaques with hypertrichosis and is often associated with other cutaneous findings such as blue-gray macules or café au lait macules. Histopathology demonstrates diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells encircling terminal folliculosebaceous units. Immunohistochemical staining shows diffuse and periadnexal S100 positivity in the mid to deep dermis, confirming the neural origin of the cells. Recognition of this entity is important to differentiate it from other similar conditions such as Becker nevus, smooth muscle hamartoma, and plexiform neurofibroma.

B: Positron emission tomography-computed tomography

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with multiple pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a right atrial mass, it is important to assess the extent and nature of the disease. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) can provide valuable information about the metabolic activity of the nodules and lymphadenopathy, aiding in the diagnosis and staging of the disease. This can help differentiate between benign and malignant processes and guide further management decisions.

276
B: Order antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a purpuric rash, fever, and other systemic symptoms raises concerns for a possible systemic vasculitis or autoimmune disorder. Ordering antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and complement levels can help evaluate for these conditions. These tests can provide valuable information about the presence of autoimmune markers and help guide further diagnosis and management. A skin biopsy may still be considered if initial laboratory tests are inconclusive or if there is a high suspicion for a specific dermatological condition, but in this case, ordering the antibody and complement level tests would be the next appropriate step. A lower extremity duplex ultrasound may be considered if there are concerns about deep vein thrombosis, but this is less likely given the presence of a localized rash and normal pedal pulses. Antibiotic therapy may not be indicated at this time, as there are no clear signs of infection and the patient's presentation is suggestive of an immune-mediated condition.

277
C: Order computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of chronic foot lesions and positive HCV status raises concern for extra-cutaneous manifestations of HCV infection. Noncutaneous manifestations of HCV infection include lymphoma, renal disease, and mixed cryoglobulinemia. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis can help evaluate these possible systemic complications associated with HCV infection. It is important to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the foot lesions.

278
B: Order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers.

Explanation: While the patient's APOE genotype (3 and 4) is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), it does not definitively diagnose the disease. The patient's symptoms, family history, and cognitive testing results are inconclusive and suggest the possibility of AD but do not provide a definitive diagnosis. Ordering cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers can provide additional information about the presence of AD pathology, such as beta-amyloid and tau proteins. This can help confirm or rule out AD as a cause for the observed dementia and assist in making treatment decisions. Additionally, close monitoring and follow-up are important to track any further cognitive changes and assess the need for intervention.

B: Order neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast

Explanation: In a young patient presenting with progressive bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, neuroimaging is necessary to rule out any structural lesions or compressive etiologies. Neurologic causes such as tumors, vascular malformations, or inflammation should be considered and can be evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. This will help identify any abnormalities, such as tumors, that may be causing the symptoms. Surgical repair of ptosis with frontalis sling can be considered after ruling out any underlying neurologic issues.
C

280
B: Initiation of anticoagulation.

Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of bilateral papilledema, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, and mastoiditis. This indicates an underlying intracranial infection and venous sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation is the recommended treatment for venous sinus thrombosis to prevent further propagation of the clot and to improve cerebral venous outflow. The other options listed (lumbar puncture, ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, and high-dose intravenous steroids) are not appropriate for the management of venous sinus thrombosis in this case. Lumbar puncture may be considered to evaluate for concurrent meningitis, but initiation of anticoagulation takes priority.

281
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, history, and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step would be B: Genetic sequencing.

Explanation:
The patient's history of painless decrease in vision, retinal vasculitis on fundus fluorescein angiography, and diffuse white matter hyperintensities with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on enhanced MRI suggest a possible underlying genetic disorder.

Given the family history of kidney failure and uremia, genetic sequencing should be pursued to evaluate for genetic causes of the patient's symptoms. Genetic sequencing can help identify mutations or abnormalities in specific genes that may be associated with the patient's retinopathy, neurologic findings, and kidney insufficiency.

Brain or kidney biopsy may not be necessary at this point, as genetic sequencing is a less invasive and more cost-effective approach to identify potential underlying genetic causes. Second CSF culture is unlikely to provide additional information since the initial CSF culture was negative. Aqueous humor paracentesis is not indicated in this case as there are no specific indications for it based on the presented information.

I would choose option A: Discuss superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.

Explanation: Superficial keratectomy involves removing the superficial layers of the cornea, which would allow for a proper examination of the corneal lesion under a microscope. This histopathologic examination can provide valuable information regarding the nature and cause of the opacity. Because the patient's symptoms have been progressively worsening and the lesion extends into the visual axis, it is important to determine the exact diagnosis and plan the appropriate treatment accordingly.

283
The correct answer is: C: Erosive pustular dermatosis.

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the patient is presenting with crusted lesions with purulent drainage, pruritus, and pain on the scalp. These findings are consistent with erosive pustular dermatosis (EPD), which is a rare inflammatory dermatosis that typically affects sun-exposed areas of the scalp. EPD is characterized by erosions, crusts, and pustules. In this case, the presence of erosions with purulent drainage suggests bacterial infection, which is supported by the growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus on wound culture. It is important to differentiate EPD from other conditions such as folliculitis decalvans, squamous cell carcinoma, and pemphigus foliaceus, as the management and treatment options may differ.
C

284
The correct answer is D: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.

Explanation: MRKH syndrome is a congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and the upper portion of the vagina. In this case, the MRI results showed a vaginal defect and uterine rudiments, confirming the diagnosis of MRKH syndrome. The patient's lack of menarche also supports this diagnosis.

Meningitis (Option A) is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and is not related to the symptoms described in this case.

VACTERL constellation (Option B) refers to a group of birth defects that can occur together, including vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities. While the patient has some congenital anomalies, her symptoms are not consistent with VACTERL constellation.

Kallmann syndrome (Option C) is a genetic disorder characterized by delayed or absent puberty and an impaired sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). While the patient has an olfactory disorder, other features of Kallmann syndrome, such as delayed puberty, are not present in this case.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.
D
285
D: Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid

Explanation: The patient's presentation of pruritic annular plaques on her extremities following initiation of a new immunotherapy regimen suggests a drug-induced reaction. The presence of numerous scattered eosinophils on histopathology supports this diagnosis. Erythema annulare centrifugum typically presents with scale and a trailing scale while eosinophilic annular erythema is commonly associated with pruritus and facial involvement. Granuloma annulare would typically exhibit a palisaded pattern on histopathology.

The answer is: A: Mantle cell lymphoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of leonine facies (thickening and furrowing of the skin giving a lion-like appearance), madarosis (loss of eyelashes and eyebrows), eschar on the nasal dorsum, and red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques on the upper extremities is consistent with the clinical findings of mantle cell lymphoma. The palpable lymph nodes, leukocytosis with lymphocytosis, and presence of small pulmonary nodules on CT scan further support this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of a diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate composed of small to medium cells with irregular nuclear contours, and positive cyclin D1 staining on immunohistochemistry are characteristic of mantle cell lymphoma.
A

287
I would choose answer option A: Place a temporary pacemaker and start ceftriaxone.

Explanation: The patient presents with complete heart block (CHB) and symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and dyspnea on exertion, which are signs of hemodynamic compromise. CHB can be a significant and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.

In this case, the underlying cause of CHB is likely an infection, given the patient's preceding viral prodrome symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein). To address the infection, ceftriaxone, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, can be initiated.

Placing a temporary pacemaker is necessary to provide electrical pacing and maintain adequate heart rate and rhythm until the underlying cause is addressed and the complete heart block is resolved.

Corticosteroids (answer option B) may be considered in certain autoimmune or inflammatory cardiac conditions, but there is no evidence to suggest their use in this particular case.

Answer options C and D, involving the implantation of devices such as a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or dual-chamber permanent pacemaker, would not be necessary at this time as the patient's condition may improve once the underlying infection is treated. These device interventions are typically reserved for patients with long-term or chronic heart rhythm abnormalities.

288
Based on the provided information, the correct diagnosis for this case is C: Rett syndrome. 

Explanation: Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects girls. It is characterized by a loss of purposeful hand skills, motor and cognitive regression, seizures, and severe scoliosis. The patient in this case exhibits several key features of Rett syndrome, including developmental delay, growth deceleration, loss of motor functions, severe scoliosis, and intellectual disability. Additionally, the brain MRI findings, such as the reduction in corpus callosum volume and enlargement of the right ventricle, support the diagnosis of Rett syndrome. The absence of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy also aligns with Rett syndrome. It is important to note that the other options listed (A: Turner syndrome, B: Fragile X syndrome, D: Cerebral palsy) do not present with the full spectrum of symptoms exhibited by the patient in this case.
C

289
B: Check urinalysis and urine microscopy to evaluate for protein in urine

Explanation: Given the patient's history of widespread edema and skin findings, as well as the significant decrease in growth and delayed speech development, there should be a concern for potential protein loss. Checking for protein in the urine through urinalysis and urine microscopy can help determine if there is significant renal involvement contributing to the edema. This can guide further workup and management for the patient. Checking nutritional laboratory measures such as serum protein, albumin, and prealbumin levels can also provide valuable information, but the initial step should be to evaluate for protein loss in the urine. Performing a skin biopsy can be considered later if the initial workup does not reveal a clear diagnosis. Treating with topical steroids may provide symptomatic relief for the dermatitis, but it does not address the underlying cause of the edema and other systemic symptoms.

I would choose answer option A: Perform a skin biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with multiple findings, including dizziness, chest pain, rash, nail changes, and neurological deficits. The skin findings, such as petechiae and splinter hemorrhages, along with the presence of infarcts in the cerebellum, suggest a possible embolic phenomenon.

Performing a skin biopsy can help determine the underlying cause of the rash and potentially identify an embolic source. This information would be crucial in guiding further management and treatment decisions.

292
D: Perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a right supraorbital abscess, which is causing mass effect on the right globe and resulting in right hypoglobus. The abscess has a direct communication with the right frontal sinus, and there are also extensive dental caries with erosion into the maxillary sinus. Given the size and location of the abscess, as well as its communication with the frontal sinus, surgical drainage is warranted. An anterior orbitotomy, in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery, would allow for adequate drainage of the abscess and management of the underlying sinus pathology.
D

293
B: Prescribe an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression (oral corticosteroid) and perform chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and other studies.

Explanation: This patient's persistent red eye, elevated intraocular pressure, dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels, and associated symptoms (headache and whooshing noise in the left ear) suggest a possible diagnosis of carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF), which is an abnormal connection between the carotid artery and cavernous sinus. CCF can lead to ocular venous congestion, raised intraocular pressure, and other ocular symptoms. In such cases, systemic immunosuppression with oral corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation. Additionally, further investigations including chest radiography, urinalysis, and blood tests can be done to rule out other causes and evaluate overall systemic health.

294
B: Obtain computed tomographic scan of the orbits.

Explanation: Given the presentation of a 2-year-old girl with acute eyelid edema and proptosis, the next step would be to obtain a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits. The CT scan would provide detailed imaging of the lesion and surrounding structures, helping to further evaluate the mass and determine its characteristics. This information is crucial for a more accurate diagnosis and to guide further management options.

The correct answer is A: Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma.

Explanation: The patient presented with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, including hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. While initial imaging was nonlocalizing for a parathyroid adenoma, increased radiopharmaceutical uptake was observed in the dominant right thyroid nodule. However, on additional review of the computed tomography scan, a well-circumscribed fat density mass was identified in the right retropharyngeal space, posterior to the hypopharynx.

This unique retropharyngeal lesion is consistent with an ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma. Ectopic parathyroid adenomas can be found in locations other than the typical posterior mediastinum, such as retropharyngeal spaces, which can present challenges in diagnosis.

Liposarcoma (option B) is a malignant tumor composed of adipocyte cells and would not explain the hyperparathyroidism-related symptoms and laboratory findings.

Ectopic thyroid (option C) refers to thyroid tissue that has an aberrant location, and is unlikely to explain the hyperparathyroidism-related symptoms and laboratory findings. 

Retropharyngeal abscess (option D) is characterized by infection and inflammation, typically presenting with symptoms such as sore throat and fever, which the patient denied. Additionally, retropharyngeal abscess would not explain the hyperparathyroidism-related symptoms and laboratory findings.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings is A: Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma.
A
296
The correct diagnosis is B: Odontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumor).

Explanation: Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a benign odontogenic tumor that arises from restorative remnants of the dental lamina or the dental follicle. It is characterized by a cystic cavity lined by a stratified squamous epithelium with a characteristic parakeratinized layer. The lesion is often encapsulated and can cause significant expansion and destruction of adjacent structures, such as the maxillary sinus and orbital floor. It is commonly associated with impacted teeth, as seen in this case with the impacted premolar. Histologically, OKC presents with a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells in anastomosing cords or islands, often forming pseudoglandular structures. The treatment of choice for OKC is complete surgical excision.
D
297
My diagnosis for this case would be C: Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome. 

Explanation: Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by rapidly progressive stiffness and nodularity of the hands. It typically affects middle-aged women and can present with redness, pain, and flexion contractures of the fingers. In this case, the negative autoimmune serology results, absence of nailfold capillary changes, and lack of Raynaud phenomenon help rule out other conditions such as scleroderma. The development of tender nodules over the palms and interphalangeal joints further supports the diagnosis of palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome. The presence of ovarian tumors with peritoneal metastases on computed tomography suggests an underlying malignancy associated with the syndrome. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic steroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may not be effective in this case due to the underlying malignancy.

The answer is C: Hobnail hemangioma.

Explanation: Hobnail hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that mainly affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It typically presents as a reddish-brown plaque with a brownish peripheral border, as seen in the patient's axilla. The biopsy findings, including positive immunohistochemical staining for CD31, CD34, and D2-40, along with negative staining for HHV-8 and WT1, support the diagnosis of hobnail hemangioma. This condition is distinct from other vascular tumors such as Kaposi sarcoma (B), which typically presents as multiple violaceous nodules and is associated with HHV-8 infection. Benign lymphangioendothelioma (A) and low-grade angiosarcoma (D) are other differential diagnoses but can be excluded based on the clinical and histopathological findings in this case.

B: Perform transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure

Explanation: Given the patient's desire to continue the pregnancy and her previous history of successful mitral valve repair, a less invasive procedure such as transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure would be more appropriate. This procedure involves placing a transcatheter valve within a previously placed annuloplasty ring to improve the stenosis and mitral valve gradient. This would be a safer option compared to surgical MV replacement, especially during pregnancy. Trial medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin could be considered, but it may not provide sufficient relief of symptoms and could be associated with risks during pregnancy. Balloon mitral valvuloplasty may also be an option, but it is less preferred due to the patient's previous unsuccessful repair and the risks associated with the procedure during pregnancy.

The correct answer is D: Lymphoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive painless neck swelling, along with laboratory findings of leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), suggests a neoplastic process. The imaging findings on MRI and FDG PET/CT demonstrate extensive lymphadenopathy and involvement of multiple sites, including the maxilla, vertebra, and sternum. These findings are characteristic of lymphoma, a malignancy of the lymphocytes. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (answer A) typically presents with bone lesions, and it is not associated with extensive lymphadenopathy or lytic bone lesions. Rosai-Dorfman disease (answer B) is a rare benign disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy with histiocytic infiltration, but it does not typically involve multiple sites or demonstrate lytic bone lesions. Neuroblastoma (answer C) is a malignant tumor arising from neural crest cells and typically affects children younger than 5 years of age. It commonly presents as an abdominal mass and does not typically cause extensive lymphadenopathy or lytic bone lesions. Therefore, lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.
B
301
The answer is D. Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation.

Explanation: The patient developed a new consolidation lesion with a dry cough after starting crizotinib therapy. While chemotherapy for disease recurrence (option A) may be considered, it is important to confirm the diagnosis before initiating any treatment. Administering antibiotics for pneumonia (option B) is not recommended as there is no evidence of infection. Suspecting TKI-induced interstitial lung disease (option C) is reasonable, but it is important to confirm the diagnosis before discontinuing the medication. A CT-guided biopsy (option D) will provide histological confirmation and rule out other causes such as granulomatous inflammation or benign disease.
The correct answer is C: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.

Explanation: The newborn's presentation with a rapidly growing parotid mass, elevated intraocular pressure, and ocular findings such as a foggy cornea and conjunctival vascular anomaly, along with the imaging findings of the intraocular mass and parotid mass, are consistent with an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). AT/RT is a rare and highly aggressive tumor primarily seen in children under three years of age.

Other answer options:

A: Retinoblastoma - Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina, but it typically does not present with a parotid mass or elevated intraocular pressure.

B: Rhabdomyosarcoma - Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that can occur at various sites, including the head and neck region. However, the specific findings described in the case, such as the ocular and parotid involvement, are not typically associated with rhabdomyosarcoma.

D: Medulloepithelioma - Medulloepithelioma is a rare, low-grade neuroepithelial tumor that arises from the primitive medullary epithelium of the CNS. It typically presents as intraocular and/or intracranial masses and does not involve the parotid gland.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings is atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT).
C
303
D: Stop ranitidine due to concern for reduced gastrointestinal magnesium absorption.

Explanation: Ranitidine is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called H2 blockers, which reduce stomach acid production. Reduced stomach acid can impair the absorption of magnesium from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to hypomagnesemia. Therefore, stopping ranitidine is a logical next step in the evaluation and management of the patient's refractory hypomagnesemia. Other options, such as evaluating for alcoholism and starting insulin, are not indicated based on the information provided. Improving glycemic control may be beneficial for the patient's overall health but may not directly impact urinary magnesium loss.

304
The correct answer is B: Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, the presence of a new subglottic mass is highly suspicious for metastatic disease. The imaging findings and laryngoscopic examination are consistent with a broad-based, exophytic mass along the posterior wall of the subglottis, which is typical of a metastatic lesion. Pathological analysis, including immunohistochemical staining, confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. This case highlights the importance of considering metastasis as a differential diagnosis in patients with a history of malignancy and new findings in other anatomical sites.

305
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the next appropriate step would be to perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias. 

Explanation: In this case, the patient's syncope followed by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia raises concern for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome such as long QT syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Treadmill stress testing can help provoke and identify any abnormal arrhythmias that may be present, providing important information for further evaluation and management. Starting amiodarone infusion therapy or implanting an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be considered later depending on the findings of the stress testing. Sending blood tests for drug levels may be helpful, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.
The answer is B: Methanol poisoning.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation, along with the finding of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography (CT) scan, is consistent with methanol poisoning. Methanol is a toxic alcohol that can cause severe central nervous system (CNS) depression and metabolic acidosis, similar to what is seen in this patient.

Clinical manifestations of methanol poisoning typically include neurological impairments such as stupor, coma, dizziness, headache, and visual disturbances. In severe cases, it can cause seizures and respiratory depression. The patient's initial symptoms of weakness, sweating, nausea, and vomiting, followed by lethargy and unconsciousness, are consistent with methanol toxicity.

The characteristic CT finding of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi is suggestive of basal ganglia involvement, which is a known CNS manifestation of methanol poisoning. The involvement of the basal ganglia can lead to movement abnormalities, as seen in the patient with facial muscle twitching, muscle weakness, and fasciculations.

Other laboratory findings, such as normal electrolyte levels, negative toxicology screen, and normal CSF analysis, along with negative results on tests for other possible causes of neurological impairment, support the diagnosis of methanol poisoning in this case.

Carbon monoxide poisoning (A) typically presents with headaches, confusion, and neurological symptoms. However, the CT finding of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi is not characteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Organophosphate poisoning (C) can cause a cholinergic toxidrome, which typically presents with symptoms such as salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, and muscle fasciculations. However, the CT finding of bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi is not associated with organophosphate poisoning.

Fahr disease (D), also known as idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain structures. It typically presents with movement disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, Fahr disease does not cause acute neurological impairments such as the ones seen in this patient.

C: Monitor closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings, including small tilted discs without pallor or hyperemia, the patient's symptoms and visual field defects are likely due to longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect. The presence of open-angle glaucoma and the reduction of intraocular pressure to the high single digits suggests that the glaucoma is well-controlled. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to monitor the patient closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing to assess for any progression or changes in the visual field defects. Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (Option A) or performing trabeculectomy (Option B) would be premature and not indicated at this time. Reassuring the patient that her findings are consistent with a congenital defect (Option D) may be appropriate, but it is important to continue monitoring and evaluating her visual field defects to ensure there are no signs of progression or other underlying causes.
A

308
The correct answer is C: Scalp metastasis.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's history, clinical presentation, and imaging findings are suggestive of a metastatic lesion on the scalp. The patient's father died of metastatic cutaneous melanoma, and the patient has a history of a supposedly benign breast nodule resection, both of which increase the suspicion for metastatic disease. Clinically, the lesion is ill-defined, infiltrated, and has an exophytic nodule with overlying alopecia. Dermoscopic evaluation does not reveal any vascular or pigmented structures. The lesion is firm, mildly tender, and adherent to the underlying bone. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed as an additional investigation, likely to rule out any brain involvement from the scalp lesion. The punch biopsy reveals cellular infiltration in the reticular dermis and monomorphic cells in a syncytial configuration, which are consistent with metastatic disease.

Chondroid syringoma (A) is a benign adnexal tumor that typically presents as a nodule on the face or extremities, not on the scalp. Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia (B) refers to the presence of aberrant meningeal tissue in the skin, typically presenting as firm, skin-colored nodules. These nodules usually occur on the head and neck, but they are not typically associated with alopecia or a history of trauma. A proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus (D) would typically show features suggestive of melanocytic proliferation on histopathology, such as increased pigmentation and atypical melanocytes.

309
D: Observe periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continued.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of bulimia and the reduction in the size and pressure of the lesions with respite from purging episodes, it is likely that the vascular lesions are related to her bulimia. In this case, the best course of action would be to continue with psychiatric treatment for her eating disorder and closely monitor the periocular lesions for any changes. This option allows for a conservative approach while addressing the underlying cause of the lesions. Other treatment options such as sclerotherapy or surgical excision may be considered if the lesions worsen or if there is a significant impact on the patient's vision or quality of life.

I would choose D: Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection. 

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the patient has a mass in the left upper eyelid that is causing swelling and is unresponsive to surgical drainage. The mass is also associated with focal enhancement in the left upper eyelid and superficial lobe of the left parotid gland on magnetic resonance imaging. With these findings, it is important to consider the possibility of an epithelial tumor. In this case, a complete posterior lamellar resection, which involves removing the affected portion of the eyelid, would be an appropriate course of action to both diagnose and treat the mass. Following the resection, the mass can be further evaluated histologically to determine the exact nature of the tumor.

B: Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy

Explanation: The patient's recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and the characteristic clinical and histologic findings, including a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption with small indurated and edematous papules, large urticariform plaques with annular configuration, hyperpigmented patches, and a biopsy showing a dermal perivascular and interstitial infiltrate rich in eosinophils, are consistent with eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. This condition is a paraneoplastic syndrome seen in patients with hematologic malignancies, and it is characterized by an intense pruritic eruption with histologic features of eosinophil-rich infiltrates. It typically presents before, during, or after the diagnosis of the underlying hematologic malignancy. Treatment involves the management of the underlying hematologic malignancy, as well as supportive measures such as antihistamines and topical corticosteroids for symptomatic relief.

312
B: Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of immigrating from Guatemala and the findings of hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly, and a nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius, the most likely diagnosis is neurocysticercosis, which is caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. Anthelminthic therapy with albendazole or praziquantel is the mainstay of treatment for neurocysticercosis. Adjuvant steroids, such as dexamethasone, are often used to reduce inflammation caused by the dying parasites. Surgical intervention may be considered in certain cases, such as if there is a significant mass effect or if the lesion is accessible for safe removal. Diverting cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt is typically reserved for cases with persistent hydrocephalus or elevated intracranial pressure that does not respond to medical treatment.
C
cellvalue empty
313
D: Order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity.

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of a systemic disorder involving the nails, lungs, and lower extremities. The yellow discoloration and thickening of the nails, along with the presence of distal onycholysis, could be indicative of a fungal infection or a systemic disease affecting the nails. Additionally, the exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema suggest a possible cardiopulmonary etiology.

Given the clinical suspicion of a systemic disorder, ordering laboratory tests to evaluate iron levels is appropriate. Iron deficiency can lead to changes in the nails, such as brittleness and discoloration. The serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity will help assess the patient's iron status and determine if iron deficiency is contributing to his symptoms.

Performing microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution may be useful to evaluate for fungal infection, but this seems less likely given the absence of other signs or symptoms suggestive of a fungal infection.

Ordering radiographs of the hands and feet may be indicated if there are specific findings or concerns related to the joints or bony structures, but there is no mention of joint pain or swelling in this case.

Ordering a thoracic CT scan may be considered later in the evaluation if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but there are no specific indications in the case description that suggest the need for immediate imaging of the thoracic region.
C

314
The correct answer is B: Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of lower abdominal pain and watery, large-volume diarrhea following chemotherapy with capecitabine is consistent with capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis. Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy agent commonly used in the treatment of various types of cancer, including metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma. One of its known side effects is gastrointestinal toxicity, which can manifest as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mucosal inflammation. The CT scan showing diffuse long-segment wall thickening involving nearly the entire terminal ileum and the ileocolonoscopy revealing erythematous and congested mucosa with erosions and ulcerations support this diagnosis. Biopsies obtained during the colonoscopy may show evidence of inflammation, further supporting the diagnosis of capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis. This diagnosis can be confirmed by the resolution of symptoms with discontinuation of capecitabine or with the use of supportive care measures, such as antidiarrheal medications and fluid and electrolyte repletion.

315
The correct answer is A: Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinning.

Explanation: The patient's history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma, bilateral peripheral iridotomies, and asymmetrically enlarged cup-disc ratio with mild pallor of the left optic nerve are indicative of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The progressive vision loss in the left eye, decreased color vision, and the diffuse thinning of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the left eye suggest diffuse optic nerve injury.

Given the findings of progressive vision loss and retinal thinning, it is important to refer the patient to a retina specialist for further evaluation and management of the glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The retina specialist will be able to provide more specialized care for glaucoma and manage the patient's condition appropriately.

D: Initiate admission, high-dose systemic steroids, and a rheumatology consult.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of severe pain, redness, decreased visual acuity, scleral thinning, and presence of an epithelial defect with underlying neovascularization and retinal detachment, the most appropriate course of action would be to initiate admission for further management. High-dose systemic steroids are indicated to reduce inflammation and manage the underlying autoimmune process. Additionally, a rheumatology consult would be beneficial to evaluate and manage the patient's thyroid eye disease, which may be contributing to the ocular findings. Fortified antibiotics or topical steroids alone would not address the severity and systemic nature of the patient's condition, and outpatient follow-up would not provide immediate intervention for the current ocular emergency.

The correct diagnosis based on the provided information is: B: Ameloblastoma.

Explanation: The radiolucent mandibular lesion with an unerupted mandibular canine, cortical destruction, and root deviation of adjacent teeth are consistent with the characteristics of an ameloblastoma. Histological sections demonstrate nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, which are typical of ameloblastomas. Additionally, the tumor involves multiple margins and shows perineural invasion. Immunohistochemistry findings reveal positive staining for p40, which is commonly seen in ameloblastomas.

My diagnosis is C: Pigmented extramammary Paget disease.

Explanation: 
Pigmented extramammary Paget disease is a rare cutaneous neoplasm that typically presents as a well-demarcated plaque in the axilla or anogenital region. It is characterized by the presence of Pagetoid cells, which are round, pale, vacuolated cells with large pleomorphic nuclei. The lesion is positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) on immunohistochemical staining. In addition, there may be scattered HMB-45-positive melanocytes surrounding the tumor cells, as seen in the biopsy specimen. Superficial spreading melanoma is unlikely in this case as there is no evidence of a primary melanocytic lesion, and the histologic features are not consistent with melanoma. Inverse lichen planus and Pagetoid Bowen disease are also unlikely based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings.

319
My diagnosis would be B: Subcutaneous dirofilariasis.

Explanation: Subcutaneous dirofilariasis is a parasitic infection caused by the filarial nematodes of the genus Dirofilaria. It is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The infection commonly affects the subcutaneous tissues, especially in the head and neck region. The clinical presentation typically includes an asymptomatic nodule on the skin.

In this case, the patient presented with a firm, nontender, skin-colored nodule on the scalp, which is consistent with subcutaneous dirofilariasis. The histopathologic examination revealed the presence of parasites surrounded by a fibrous capsule, with characteristic features such as a thick cuticle, well-developed inner muscular layer, tubular structures containing microfilariae, and necrotic debris.

The absence of lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, or other cutaneous lesions, as well as the normal findings on slitlamp examination, fundoscopy, and laboratory investigations, helps differentiate subcutaneous dirofilariasis from other conditions.

Onchocercoma (A) is a manifestation of onchocerciasis, which is caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, and typically presents with pruritic skin nodules, visual impairment, and other systemic symptoms.

Cutaneous loiasis (C) is caused by the filarial nematode Loa loa and presents with migratory subcutaneous swellings called Calabar swellings, as well as other systemic symptoms.

Subcutaneous hydatid cyst (D) is caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus and typically occurs in the liver and lungs. It is characterized by the presence of cysts with daughter cysts and hydatid sand.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and exclusion of other conditions, the most likely diagnosis in this case is subcutaneous dirofilariasis (B).

The diagnosis is (B) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with recurrent sore throat, hoarseness of voice, auricular chondritis, saddle nose deformity, and respiratory symptoms, along with elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), suggests a systemic autoimmune disease. The negative results for antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies help rule out other possibilities such as relapsing polychondritis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The presence of saddle-nose deformity, respiratory symptoms, and the absence of upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms suggest a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Further evaluation, including imaging and biopsy, should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.
C: Order hemoglobin electrophoresis

Explanation: Given the patient's African American ethnicity and the presence of retinal findings consistent with sickle cell retinopathy (salmon-patch hemorrhages, neovascularization elsewhere), it is important to consider the possibility of sickle cell disease or trait. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a diagnostic test used to identify hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease. Ordering this test will help confirm or rule out sickle cell disease as the underlying cause of the patient's retinopathy.

A: Tuberculosis

Explanation: The patient's history of immigration from Syria, exposure to latent tuberculosis infection in both parents, and the presence of diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas on biopsy suggest a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Other tests, such as acid-fast bacilli stain and tuberculin purified protein derivative, were negative, which can occur in extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
B
323
B: Plan an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Explanation: Given the presentation of a unilateral retinal mass in a pediatric patient, it is important to further investigate the nature of the mass to determine the appropriate management. An urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and MRI can provide more detailed information about the mass, including its size, location, and characteristics. This will help in determining the possible etiology of the mass and guide further management. It is important to rule out any underlying systemic conditions or associated abnormalities. Monitoring clinically with serial examinations may not provide enough information to make an accurate diagnosis and may delay appropriate intervention if necessary. It is important to take prompt action in cases like these to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient.

I would choose option A: Perform positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to rule out tumor metastasis. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the presence of a mobile mass on the tricuspid valve and elevated D-dimer levels, raises suspicion for the possibility of tumor metastasis. A PET-CT scan can help identify any potential metastatic lesions in other organs, as well as evaluate the extent of disease involvement. This information is important in guiding further management decisions, including the need for resection surgery or other interventions.

C: Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF

Explanation: Since the initial punch biopsy showed spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate suggesting an incipient autoimmune bullous process, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any changes in the pathology. Another punch biopsy with hematoxylin-eosin staining and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) can provide additional information to guide further management decisions.

B: No coronary stenosis. Because of the chest pain, recommend further functional testing.

Explanation: Although the coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no evidence of coronary stenosis or plaque, the patient's atypical chest pain persists. Given the inconclusive stress ECG and stress magnetic resonance perfusion imaging performed previously, it would be prudent to perform further functional testing to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) as the cause of the symptoms. This will help provide a more comprehensive evaluation and guide the management of the patient.

327
B: Cancer-associated pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome (PPP) syndrome

Explanation: The patient's presentation with arthritis, skin nodules, and pancreatitis is consistent with PPP syndrome, which is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with an underlying malignancy. The widespread arthritis, skin nodules, and elevated levels of lipase and amylase indicate pancreatitis. The ill-defined cutaneous lesions, along with the involvement of multiple joints, suggest an inflammatory process. This combination of symptoms and findings is characteristic of the PPP syndrome, which is often associated with an underlying malignancy.

C: Advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology.

Explanation: The combination of optic nerve edema, venous stasis retinopathy, and peripheral retinal whitening in the context of elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure, severe anemia, lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and elevated IgM level is highly suggestive of a paraneoplastic process. Plasmapheresis, in consultation with oncology, would be the next step to remove the pathogenic antibodies or immune complexes and potentially improve the patient's symptoms and visual outcomes. Furthermore, urgent intervention is necessary due to the potential for irreversible vision loss in this clinical scenario.

The correct answer is C: Tornwaldt cyst.

Explanation: Tornwaldt cyst, also known as a pharyngeal bursa cyst, is a developmental anomaly that arises from remnants of the embryonic notochord. These cysts are typically located in the midline of the nasopharynx, at the pharyngeal tonsil level. The symptoms associated with Tornwaldt cysts include globus sensation, dysphagia, nasal obstruction, and sometimes referred otalgia. On imaging, these cysts appear as well-defined, round or oval lesions with low attenuation or signal intensity. In this case, the cyst is communicating with the atlantoaxial joint, which is a unique finding that can help distinguish it from other types of pharyngeal cysts. Treatment for Tornwaldt cysts involves surgical excision if symptoms are present.
A

Based on the information provided, the appropriate next step would be to choose option B: Photocoagulate lesions with argon laser at slitlamp evaluation.

Explanation: The patient presents with episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss and examination findings of abnormal blood vessels and hyperfluorescent lesions at the pupillary margin of the iris. These findings suggest the presence of iris neovascularization, which can lead to complications such as angle closure glaucoma and vision loss. Photocoagulation with argon laser is an effective treatment option for iris neovascularization, aiming to destroy the abnormal blood vessels and reduce the risk of complications. Therefore, this is the most appropriate next step in managing this case.

B: IgG4-related disease

Explanation: The presentation of progressive saddle nose deformity, bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and findings on nasal endoscopy, along with the histopathologic findings of prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis, and increased IgG4 absolute count, suggest IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease is a rare immune-mediated disorder characterized by elevated serum levels of IgG4 and infiltration of affected tissues by IgG4-positive plasma cells. In this case, the patient's elevated IgG4 absolute count and the presence of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and angiocentric fibrosis on histopathologic examination support the diagnosis.
B
332
I would choose option C: Urgently start high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during hospitalization.

Explanation: Based on the patient's clinical presentation, examination findings, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic myocarditis. The patient's symptoms, including chest pain radiating to the jaw, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss, are concerning for cardiac involvement. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows low voltages, inferior Q waves, and poor R-wave progression, which are suggestive of myocardial involvement. The elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T levels indicate cardiac dysfunction and injury. The presence of eosinophilia in the peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy further supports the diagnosis.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the evidence of severe biventricular systolic dysfunction on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), urgent treatment is warranted. High-dose steroids, such as prednisone, are the mainstay of treatment for eosinophilic myocarditis to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response. Colchicine and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, can also be added to the treatment regimen to further reduce inflammation and pain. These medications can be initiated during hospitalization to closely monitor the patient's response and adjust the treatment as needed.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate course of action for this patient.

The correct answer is:

B: Erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides

Explanation: The clinical presentation of concentric, annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques diffusely involving the chest, back, and abdomen is consistent with erythema gyratum repens-like eruption. This specific presentation is often seen in association with mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Histopathology of biopsy samples typically reveals epidermal hyperplasia with spongiosis and parakeratosis, as well as an infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction. CD30 immunohistochemical stains can further highlight the presence of atypical lymphocytes. Although lung adenocarcinoma and pityriasis rubra pilaris can present with similar clinical features, they are less likely in this case given the specific histopathological findings and the association with mycosis fungoides. Tinea imbricata is a fungal infection that typically presents as concentric, erythematous, scaly plaques; however, it is unlikely in this case as the clinical presentation and histopathology are not consistent with a fungal infection.

Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the next step should be D: Genetic testing. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive loss of iris pigmentation, photophobia, and decreased visual acuity, in addition to the presence of iris atrophy and transillumination defects, are indicative of a condition known as progressive iris atrophy (PIA). PIA is an uncommon condition that is often hereditary and is associated with multiple genetic mutations.

Genetic testing would help to identify any underlying genetic mutations that could be responsible for the patient's symptoms. This information would be valuable in confirming the diagnosis of PIA and determining the appropriate management plan for the patient.

Anterior segment fluorescein angiography, aqueous tap, and sickle cell testing are not indicated based on the patient's presentation and history.

The correct answer is C: Persistent trigeminal artery.

Explanation: In this case, the enhancing structure at the skull base along the carotid sheath is most likely a persistent trigeminal artery. The persistent trigeminal artery is a rare vascular anomaly characterized by the persistence of the embryonic fetal carotid-basilar anastomosis. It is typically asymptomatic but can occasionally be associated with neurologic symptoms or vascular compression. Diagnosis is usually made with imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In this case, the patient's imaging showed the presence of an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath, which is consistent with a persistent trigeminal artery. This finding is unrelated to the patient's oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

B: Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain

Explanation: Given the history of a violaceous maculopapular rash, headache, and other systemic symptoms along with the ophthalmic findings of intraretinal hemorrhages, neovascularization, and peripheral vascular sheathing, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an MRI and MRA of the brain. This is to evaluate for possible central nervous system involvement, such as vasculitis or other neurologic abnormalities, which could be contributing to the ocular findings.

I would choose answer option B: Test for vitamin A deficiency, with additional conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diffuse redness and tearing in the left eye, along with extensive keratinization of the conjunctiva and neovascular fronds, suggest a cicatricial disease, which is characterized by scarring and fibrosis of the conjunctiva. This can lead to visual impairment if left untreated. Vitamin A deficiency can contribute to conjunctival keratinization, so testing for this deficiency is important. Conjunctival biopsies can help evaluate the pathology of the condition and determine if there are any immune deposits present. Treatment with artificial tears alone may not be sufficient, and waiting 6 months without further intervention or evaluation could lead to progression of the disease. Extensive excision and reconstruction may not be necessary at this stage and should be considered only if other treatment options fail.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is A: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Explanation: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) is a rare autoimmune vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels. It commonly presents with respiratory tract involvement, such as sinusitis and nodules or infiltrates in the lungs, as seen in this case. However, it can also involve other organs, including the skin, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.

The presentation of edematous, necrotic papules and plaques on the extremities, buttocks, and face with sharp demarcation at the nasolabial folds, along with involvement of the oral mucosa, is highly characteristic of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The systemic symptoms of extreme fatigue, weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The skin biopsy findings, along with the laboratory abnormalities including leukocytosis, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, and proteinuria, further support the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (A).

C: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joint 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including lower back pain, morning stiffness, and involvement of multiple joints, raises suspicion for an inflammatory arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis. The radiographic findings of sclerosis and joint narrowing at the sacroiliac joints further support this suspicion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints is the next appropriate step in evaluating for inflammation and structural damage characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. This can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Checking ferritin and transferrin saturation is not necessary for the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. Rheumatoid factor (RF) is more specific for rheumatoid arthritis and does not typically present with involvement of the sacroiliac joints. Referring for surgical consultation is premature at this stage.

B: Start angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor

Explanation: Based on the physical examination findings, specifically the fixed split S2 and the systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, along with the electrocardiogram findings of incomplete right bundle-branch block, it is likely that this young woman has a congenital heart defect called atrial septal defect (ASD). This is further supported by the enlarged right atrium and right ventricle seen on echocardiography. ASD causes increased blood flow to the right side of the heart, leading to right atrial and right ventricular enlargement.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly used in the management of heart failure and can help reduce symptoms such as exercise intolerance. In this case, starting an ACE inhibitor would be an appropriate initial management strategy to help alleviate the patient's symptoms and potentially prevent further right-sided heart enlargement.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (option A) may provide more detailed information about the size and location of the ASD, but it is not necessary for the initial management of this patient. Cardiac catheterization (option C) can be used to confirm the diagnosis of ASD and may be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty or if intervention is required. Referring to a pulmonologist (option D) would not be appropriate in this case as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a cardiac issue, not a pulmonary one.

B: Chloroma

Explanation: Chloroma, also known as myeloid sarcoma or extramedullary leukemia, is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into extramedullary tissues, including the skin. In this case, the patient's history of acute myelogenous leukemia and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant suggests a possible association with chloroma. The green-gray color of the nodules is characteristic of chloroma, which is attributed to the presence of myeloperoxidase within the leukemic cells. Biopsies of the skin lesions can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating infiltration of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells on histopathology.
B
cellvalue empty
342
The correct answer is D: Sarcoidosis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of dizziness, tingling in the lower extremities, gait disturbances, and mild weakness in the left leg suggests a neurological involvement. The presence of enlarged cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes, along with the generalized lymphadenopathy observed on whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, suggests a systemic disease. The brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing multiple enhancing lesions further supports a systemic inflammatory process.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes. The characteristic findings on imaging, along with the absence of skin lesions, negative infectious serology, and inconclusive workup for malignancies and autoimmune diseases, suggest sarcoidosis as the most likely diagnosis.

Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia, also known as Job's syndrome, is typically characterized by recurrent infections, not neurological symptoms. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a systemic vasculitis, but it typically presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitic lesions involving the lungs and other organs, rather than neurological symptoms. Lymphoma would typically present with more specific findings on imaging, such as solid masses, and would also have abnormal findings on systemic workup.

343
Answer: C

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, and fever, along with the presence of exudative foci on chest radiography, the next step should be to perform computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta. This is because the combination of dysphagia and dyspnea raises concern for an aortic pathology, such as aortic dissection or aneurysm, which can lead to compression of adjacent structures in the mediastinum, including the esophagus and airways. CTA of the aorta can help identify any abnormalities in the aorta and determine if they are causing the patient's symptoms.
B: Start topical corticosteroid eyedrops

Explanation: The presentation of redness, irritation, and blurred vision along with the findings of corneal edema, thickened stroma, and dense Descemet folds suggest an inflammatory response in the cornea. This is consistent with a diagnosis of corneal edema. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops are commonly used to reduce inflammation in the cornea and can help to alleviate the symptoms and improve the visual acuity.

345
I would choose answer option C: Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck. 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of severe left-sided facial pain and acute ptosis, it is important to rule out any vascular abnormality that may be causing these symptoms. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck can help to evaluate the blood vessels in these areas for any potential abnormalities such as aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or vascular compression. This test can provide valuable information about the blood flow and vascular structures in the region, helping to guide further diagnosis and management.

346
The correct answer is:

C: Malignant pheochromocytoma

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of flushing, vomiting, abdominal pain, and the presence of a paraspinal mass are consistent with a diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. They commonly secrete catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which can cause symptoms like flushing, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal disturbances. The CT-guided biopsy findings of a monomorphic infiltrate of small- to medium-sized round cells with uniform angulated nuclei and abundant cytoplasm are also consistent with malignant pheochromocytoma.
B

347
I would choose option D: Repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy in the left eye.

Explanation: Since the initial microbial analysis and culture results were inconclusive, it is important to repeat the diagnostic vitrectomy and subretinal biopsy to further investigate the cause of the infection and inflammation. This will provide additional samples for analysis and increase the chances of identifying the causative agent. Additionally, the worsening symptoms and lack of improvement with broad-spectrum antimicrobials indicate the need for further investigation and intervention.

The correct answer is C: Cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presented with a chronic erythematous nodule with a central crust on the nail fold. The lesion had started as a light erythema and had not improved with antibiotics or antiviral therapy, indicating that it was not a bacterial paronychia or herpetic whitlow. The biopsy results showed diffuse dermatitis with epithelioid granulomas and the presence of intracellular amastigotes in the dermal macrophages, which are consistent with cutaneous leishmaniasis. This parasitic infection is caused by the protozoan Leishmania and is endemic in certain regions, including rural areas on the Mediterranean coast.
C

349
B: Obtain polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, with coin-shaped keratic precipitates and new anterior chamber inflammation, along with negative culture results, raises suspicion for a viral infection such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). To confirm the presence of CMV, obtaining a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the aqueous humor for CMV DNA is the appropriate next step. This will provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management and treatment options.
B
cellvalue empty
350
The correct answer is C: Sinonasal meningioma.

Explanation: Sinonasal meningioma is a rare tumor that arises from the meninges in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Patients typically present with symptoms of chronic sinusitis, including nasal obstruction, facial pain, and clear nasal discharge. The characteristic finding on imaging is a soft tissue mass with extension into the frontal sinus, as seen in the MRI scan provided in the case. The pathology findings of uniform, epithelioid cells arranged in a whorled, lobulated growth pattern without atypia or necrosis are consistent with a meningioma. Intranuclear inclusions may also be seen.

Esthesioneuroblastoma (A) is a malignant tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and anosmia. Pott puffy tumor (B) is a complication of frontal sinusitis where there is osteomyelitis of the frontal bone resulting in a swollen forehead. Sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma (D) is an aggressive malignant tumor that arises from neuroendocrine cells in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It typically presents with nasal obstruction and epistaxis. None of these diagnoses match the clinical and pathological findings described in the case.
C
351
B: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation: The patient's history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, with previous metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes, along with the immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 (markers indicative of squamous cell carcinoma) and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (a marker for thyroid follicular cells), suggest that the mass in the left thyroid lobe is consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma rather than primary thyroid malignancies such as papillary thyroid carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
B
352
B: Order a lower extremity angiogram

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of exertional calf pain, along with the findings of diminished pulses and the results of the exercise treadmill ABI test, are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). To confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of arterial blockages, an angiogram would be the appropriate next step. This test will provide detailed images of the arteries in the lower extremities and help determine the appropriate medical management for the patient.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be:

B: Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology

Explanation: The patient's presentation of generalized abdominal pain and distention, along with the findings of pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum, suggests the possibility of a malignancy, such as ovarian or colorectal cancer. Since the initial ultrasound-guided paracentesis was nondiagnostic, repeating the procedure with image guidance can help obtain a cellular specimen for cytology analysis, which can provide valuable information about the nature of the lesion. This will help guide further management decisions.
A

354
The correct answer is D: Sarcoidosis.

Explanation: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect multiple organs, including the skin. Cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis are diverse and can present in various ways, including plaques, papules, nodules, and lupus pernio. In this case, the description of a well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale, punctate hemorrhagic crusts, and histopathologic findings of psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia overlying suppurative granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleate giant cells and rare eosinophilic spheroid forms are characteristic of sarcoidosis.

Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii and typically presents as subcutaneous nodules along the draining lymphatics. This presentation, along with the histopathologic findings described, does not fit the clinical picture.

Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris refers to the phenomenon where new psoriatic lesions develop at the site of prior injury or trauma. Although the history of a prior injury is mentioned in the case, the clinical and histopathologic findings do not suggest psoriasis vulgaris.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. Cutaneous involvement in granulomatosis with polyangiitis is typically seen with palpable purpura or vasculitic ulcers. The description and histopathologic findings in this case do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings is sarcoidosis.

355
C: Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

Explanation: Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is a life-saving intervention used in cases of cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest when other measures have failed. In this case, the patient is experiencing rapidly declining blood pressure and asystole despite efforts to stabilize him with fluids and vasopressors. Initiation of VA-ECMO can provide temporary circulatory support and oxygenation, allowing time for further interventions to be considered.

356
The answer is C: Chondroma.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with dysphonia, throat tightness, and vocal effort after significant voice use. The videostroboscopy findings revealed residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold, with a reduction in lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left. Intraoperatively, a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold was identified, as well as a subtle but similar finding on the right true vocal fold. The lesion was excised using a CO2 laser, and histologic examination showed fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis, consistent with a chondroma. Following treatment, the patient reported improvement in voice with decreased effort and strain.

B
357
A: Focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis)

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is a focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis). Focal melanotic macules are benign, pigmented lesions that occur in the oral cavity. They commonly present as flat, well-defined brown patches with irregular borders. Microscopically, they are characterized by the presence of benign dendritic melanocytes scattered throughout the epithelium. Focal melanotic macules are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment unless of cosmetic concern. It is important to differentiate them from other pigmented lesions such as oral melanoacanthosis, blue nevus, or malignant melanoma through proper clinical evaluation and histopathological examination.
B
358
The correct answer option is D: Chondrosarcoma.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and findings on imaging, the most likely diagnosis is chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage cells and can occur in the head and neck region, including the masticator space. On imaging, chondrosarcomas typically appear as T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense lesions with bony erosion and expansion. In this case, the lesion is centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle and there is benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall. Schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that typically presents with gradual onset and slow progression of symptoms. Juvenile angiofibroma is a vascular tumor that typically occurs in adolescent males and presents with nasal obstruction and epistaxis. Odontogenic keratocyst is a benign cystic lesion that typically arises from the dental follicle and is commonly associated with impacted teeth. None of these options are consistent with the clinical presentation and findings in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chondrosarcoma.
A
359
C: Metastatic sarcoma

Explanation: The presentation of a young adult with a palpable mass in the neck, along with the presence of liver and bone metastases, raises suspicion for metastatic disease. Given the avid enhancement of the bilateral carotid space masses on imaging and their close association with the carotid bifurcation, metastatic sarcoma is a likely diagnosis. Glomus vagale and carotid body tumors typically arise from paraganglionic tissue and are not commonly associated with metastasis. Lymphoma typically presents with lymphadenopathy, which was not mentioned in this case.
B
360
B: Discontinue immunosuppression therapy.

Explanation: The patient's history of tick bite, persistent fever, anemia, and central scotoma raises suspicion for an infectious etiology such as babesiosis. Immunosuppression therapy with ustekinumab can increase the risk of opportunistic infections. Discontinuing immunosuppression therapy is crucial to allow the immune system to effectively fight off the infection. Further diagnostic tests, such as indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography, may be considered to assess the extent of ocular involvement and monitor treatment response. Repeat neuroimaging is unlikely to provide additional information in this case.
C
cellvalue empty
361
B: Perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure

Explanation: Lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient. The patient has bilateral optic nerve head edema without any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, suggesting asymptomatic papilledema. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including empty sella, flattened posterior globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, are consistent with elevated intracranial pressure. However, these findings are not specific for the etiology of increased intracranial pressure and further evaluation is necessary. Lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure is the gold standard test to confirm elevated intracranial pressure and to assess for any additional etiologies such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Additionally, this test can also help rule out other potential causes such as infection or malignancy. The other options, including enhanced depth imaging-oct, venography, and acetazolamide, may be considered in the evaluation of papilledema but are not the most appropriate initial step.
C
cellvalue empty
362
B: Assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels

Explanation: Given the patient's heavy alcohol consumption and poor nutrition, it is important to assess for deficiencies that may be contributing to his severe vision loss. Excessive alcohol intake can lead to vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 and folate, which can cause optic neuropathy. Assessing the levels of these vitamins in the serum can help determine if supplementation is necessary. Liver function tests may be considered as well to evaluate for alcohol-related liver damage, but assessing vitamin levels would be a more immediate and relevant step in this case. Treatment with disulfiram is used for alcohol dependence and is not appropriate in this acute setting. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain may be considered if there are additional neurological symptoms or signs, but it is not the next step in evaluating this patient's vision loss.

363
I would choose answer option C: Stop netarsudil in both eyes.

Explanation: The patient's worsening corneal edema and pain, along with the new opacification and high pressures, suggest that netarsudil may be contributing to the corneal edema. Netarsudil is a rho-kinase inhibitor that can cause corneal endothelial cell loss and corneal edema as potential side effects. Discontinuing netarsudil in both eyes would be the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's corneal edema and symptoms.

364
Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips, along with the presence of periungual erythema and dilated nailfold capillaries, is suggestive of digital ischemia. The positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at a high titer, along with the presence of anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, and anti-Scl-70 antibodies, are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone is the appropriate next step in management to reduce inflammation and potentially prevent further damage to the blood vessels. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin is not indicated in the absence of evidence of thrombosis. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is not indicated unless there is clinical evidence of infection. Vasodilator therapy with nifedipine may be used as part of the long-term management of scleroderma-related vasculopathy, but initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids is needed to address the acute inflammation.
A: Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis

Explanation: The patient's presentation of erythematous and scaly plaques on the lower extremities, along with the accompanying systemic symptoms such as weight loss and lower extremity weakness, is consistent with plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis. The biopsy findings of granulomatous inflammation and well-formed epithelioid granulomas further support this diagnosis. Other options such as lymphomatoid granulomatosis, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, and cutaneous tuberculosis do not align with the clinical presentation and histologic findings.
A

366
The answer is C: Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and the folliculotropic variant specifically involves the hair follicles. The indurated plaque on the eyelid, along with the perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates and exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes seen on histopathology, are consistent with this diagnosis. The immunohistochemical analysis further supports this diagnosis, as the lymphocytic infiltrates are positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7, markers associated with T-cell lymphomas. The monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement demonstrated on molecular analysis is also characteristic of mycosis fungoides.

367
C: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

Explanation: The MRI findings of T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement are consistent with the characteristic imaging findings of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV). It is typically seen in patients with immunosuppression, such as those receiving rituximab, a monoclonal antibody commonly used in the treatment of lymphomas. The clinical presentation of vision loss and cognitive impairment further supports the diagnosis of PML in this patient. Metastatic breast cancer typically presents with contrast-enhancing brain lesions. Central nervous system lymphoma would typically present as contrast-enhancing brain lesions as well. Glioma is a broad term that encompasses various types of brain tumors, and the MRI findings in this case are not typical for glioma.

368
C: Obtain chest radiographs

Explanation: The ECG shows a high-QRS voltage and a left axis deviation pattern, suggestive of possible displacement or malposition of the pacemaker leads. Chest radiographs can help confirm the position of the leads and identify any abnormalities or complications, such as lead dislodgement or pneumothorax. This will guide further management and determine if any intervention, such as lead revision or repositioning, is required.

369
A: Kaposi sarcoma. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with violaceous nodules involving the base of the tongue and lower extremities, as well as an obstructing laryngeal mass, along with the strong staining for human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) on biopsy, is consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor that commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV. The presence of untreated syphilis in this patient may have increased his susceptibility to HHV-8 infection and subsequent development of Kaposi sarcoma. Syphilitic gumma of the larynx would present as a destructive granulomatous lesion rather than a spindle cell lesion, and bacillary angiomatosis and angiosarcoma would not stain strongly for HHV-8.
A
370
The correct answer is C: Secretory carcinoma.

Explanation:
The histologic findings described in the case, including microcystic and papillary architecture, abundant bubbly secretion within microcystic spaces, and positive staining for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15), are consistent with secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland. Secretory carcinoma is a rare, low-grade malignant neoplasm that typically affects the parotid gland. It is characterized by the presence of microcysts and solid areas composed of polygonal epithelial cells, which often contain voluminous eosinophilic or clear secretory material.

Acinic cell carcinoma (A) typically shows a microcystic pattern with cytoplasmic zymogen granules and is often PAS positive, but it lacks the characteristic secretory material seen in secretory carcinoma.

Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (B) is a generic term used to describe adenocarcinomas in which specific subtypes cannot be confidently diagnosed. It does not accurately describe the specific findings seen in this case.

Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (D) is the most common subtype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma and typically shows a mix of mucin-secreting, intermediate, and epidermoid cells. It does not exhibit the microcystic and papillary architecture, or the characteristic secretory material seen in secretory carcinoma.
C
371
C: Complete serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy 

Explanation: The presentation of multiple yellow choroidal lesions with loss of choroidal vascular detail and lymphoid tumor-like conjunctival thickening suggests a potential diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma. To confirm this diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease, further investigations including serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy are necessary. These tests will help evaluate the presence of abnormal lymphoid cells and determine the specific subtype of lymphoma, guiding further treatment decisions.

372
D: Computed tomography scan of the orbits.

Explanation: The presentation of an ulcerated eyelid lesion associated with facial numbness raises concerns for a potentially serious underlying condition, such as malignancy or infection involving deeper structures. Therefore, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits should be performed to assess for any bony or soft tissue abnormalities. This will help in confirming the diagnosis and guiding further management. The other options, such as continued antibiotic therapy, wound debridement, or excisional biopsy, may be considered depending on the findings of the CT scan.

Answer: A: Administer systemic corticosteroids

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation, including visual acuity loss, disc edema, anterior chamber and vitreous cell, and retinal findings, the most likely diagnosis is a rapidly progressing retinal vaso-occlusive disease. This condition often requires urgent treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the optic nerve and retina. Option A, administering systemic corticosteroids, is the most appropriate next step in management. Options B, C, and D are not indicated in this case and would not address the underlying inflammation and vascular occlusion.
C

374
D: Perform fluorescein angiography.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of reduced peripheral vision, optic nerve pallor, vascular attenuation, and the presence of increased pigmentation in the superior retina of the right eye, fluorescein angiography would be a useful diagnostic tool. It can help assess the integrity of the retinal vasculature and identify any abnormalities or leakage that may be contributing to the patient's vision loss. This can provide valuable information for diagnosing the underlying cause of the peripheral vision loss.

375
Answer: D: Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Explanation: The presence of multiple iris lesions in both eyes, along with progressive visual obscuration in the left eye, raises suspicion for a systemic condition. To investigate the possibility of metastatic disease, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed. This can help identify any potential primary tumor or metastatic lesions in other organs. Kidney ultrasonography and positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be indicated depending on the findings of the CT scan, but they are not the initial investigation of choice. Surgical iridectomy may be considered as a treatment option if the iris cysts are causing significant visual impairment, but it does not address the underlying systemic cause.

376
I would choose answer option B: Change voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B.

Explanation: The patient's worsening chest pain, cavitary mass enlargement, and possible pleural invasion suggest disease progression despite treatment with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and voriconazole. Given the presence of fungal elements in the bronchoalveolar lavage culture (Aspergillus niger) and the negative response to voriconazole, it is reasonable to switch to a different antifungal agent. Liposomal amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that can be effective against Aspergillus species. This change in therapy may help control the fungal infection and prevent further disease progression.

377
B: Actinic prurigo cheilitis

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms of generalized pruritus, along with the clinical examination findings of erythematous papules, crusted lesions, and excoriations on the trunk and upper extremities, are characteristic of actinic prurigo. Additionally, the presence of scales, crusts, and fissures on the lower lip (Figure 1B) further supports the diagnosis of actinic prurigo cheilitis.

Actinic prurigo is a type of chronic photosensitivity disorder that primarily affects individuals with a genetic predisposition. It typically presents as an intensely itchy rash, predominantly on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and extensor surfaces of the arms. Actinic prurigo cheilitis refers specifically to the involvement of the lips.

Herpes simplex virus-associated pseudolymphoma would present with different clinical features, such as vesicles or ulcers on the affected area, which are not observed in this case. Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia and marginal zone lymphoma also have distinct clinical and histopathological features and would not typically present with isolated pruritus without other systemic symptoms.

379
B: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of angina and dyspnea with exertion, along with the findings of a fixed, severe apical defect on exercise nuclear stress testing, indicate significant coronary artery disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would be the preferred treatment option if feasible, however, the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and multiple putative chest colds in the past suggests a potential inflammatory etiology for his disease. In such cases, the success rate of PCI may be lower, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery would be a more appropriate choice for revascularization. CABG surgery provides more complete revascularization by bypassing the blocked coronary arteries with grafts, ensuring improved blood flow to the myocardium. Therefore, the next step would be to proceed with coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Answer: C: Order cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of painless progressive vision loss, gait changes, memory loss, and weight loss, along with the ophthalmic findings of homonymous hemianopia and asymmetric deficits on Goldmann perimetry, there is a suspicion for a neurodegenerative disease. Ordering a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prion disease panel would be the next appropriate step to evaluate for potential prion-related disorders, which can present with a similar clinical picture. Prion diseases are a group of rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal protein aggregation in the central nervous system. Obtaining a CSF sample for analysis can help determine the presence of abnormal proteins, such as prions, and aid in the diagnosis of a prion disease.

cellvalue empty
381
C: Order systemic laboratory workup 

Explanation: The presence of slow progressive unilateral blepharoptosis with a palpable mass and yellow nodular lesion along the tarsal conjunctiva suggests the possibility of an underlying systemic disorder, such as amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal protein fibrils in various organs and tissues, including the eyelids. The histopathologic findings of amorphous acellular deposits that stain positive for Congo red and show apple-green birefringence on polarized microscopy are consistent with amyloidosis.

In order to determine the underlying cause of the amyloidosis, a systemic laboratory workup should be ordered. This may include tests such as serum electrophoresis, immunofixation, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, and plasma cell disorder markers (e.g., serum-free light chains). These tests can help identify the specific type and etiology of amyloidosis, guide management decisions, and assess for systemic involvement.

Complete excision or cryotherapy treatment may be considered for localized forms of eyelid amyloidosis, but given the potential systemic implications, a systemic workup should be done first. Observation alone may not be appropriate if there is concern for underlying systemic disease.

C: Retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle.

Explanation: The patient's worsening visual acuity and extensive exudative retinal detachments in both eyes indicate a need for prompt surgical intervention. Retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle is the appropriate treatment option to reattach the retina and prevent further vision loss. Initiating immunosuppressive therapy does not address the underlying issue of retinal detachment and would not be the first-line treatment. Monitoring for resolution of subretinal fluid is not sufficient considering the severity of the patient's condition. Surgery to create scleral windows is not indicated in this case as the primary problem is retinal detachment.

383
C: Mycosis fungoides

Explanation: Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with skin lesions. The clinical presentation in this case, with a solitary scaly plaque on the lower extremity, is consistent with mycosis fungoides. The histopathological findings, including epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, Pautrier microabscesses, and lymphocytes along the dermoepidermal junction, further support this diagnosis. Immunohistochemical staining showing CD3, CD5, and CD8 positivity is also characteristic of mycosis fungoides. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (option A) typically presents with bone lesions and is unlikely in this case. Lymphomatoid contact dermatitis (option B) typically presents as a reaction to substances that come in contact with the skin and is not consistent with the prolonged duration of the lesion in this case. Pagetoid reticulosis (option D), also known as extramammary Paget's disease, typically presents as a solitary erythematous plaque with Paget cells in the epidermis, which is different from the histopathological findings described in this case.

The diagnosis for this case is B: Linear atrophoderma of Moulin.

Explanation: Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is a rare acquired dermatosis characterized by asymptomatic hyperpigmented macules that follow the lines of Blaschko. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence, and the hyperpigmented areas may gradually expand and become more intense over time. The skin in the affected areas may appear slightly atrophic, and there is usually no associated induration. The histopathology findings typically show normal epidermis and dermis with slight hyperpigmentation of the basal layer of the epidermis and preserved elastic fibers in the reticular dermis. This condition does not respond well to treatments such as corticosteroids, phototherapy, or systemic medications.

D: Telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma.

Explanation: The clinical and histopathologic features described, including the violaceous appearance, ectatic vascular channels lined by atypical plump endothelial cells, and negative immunohistochemistry for Human herpesvirus 8, are consistent with telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma. Kaposi sarcoma could be a consideration due to the clinical appearance but can be ruled out by the negative immunohistochemistry for Human herpesvirus 8. Elder abuse would not be a likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma could be a consideration, but the rapid onset and violaceous appearance, as well as the negative immunohistochemistry, make telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma a more likely diagnosis.

Answer: D: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM).

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation of painful involuntary spasms involving axial and lower limb muscles, with hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and rigidity, is consistent with the diagnosis of Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). PERM is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by rigidity, spasms, myoclonus, and autonomic dysfunction. The presence of Hashimoto thyroiditis, elevated levels of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, and the absence of oligoclonal bands or infection on cerebrospinal fluid testing support the diagnosis of an autoimmune etiology. The continuous firing of normal motor unit potentials on needle electromyography (EMG) and absence of abnormalities on MRI suggest a predominantly central origin for this movement disorder. Treatment typically involves immunosuppressive therapy.

B: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of painful, indurated plaques on the lower legs with edema, along with the presence of atypical large lymphoid cells in the skin biopsy specimen, suggests intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL). IVLBCL is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of lymphoma cells within the lumen of small blood vessels. This can result in cutaneous manifestations, such as erythematous plaques. Systemic symptoms, like fever, are also common. Laboratory findings, including anemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, are consistent with IVLBCL. The presence of a high viral load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in peripheral blood is an additional finding that can be seen in some cases of IVLBCL. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

D: Perform transesophageal echocardiography.

Explanation:
Given the patient's presentation with worsening dyspnea, lower extremity edema, new heart murmur, and the findings of severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and mildly dilated aortic root on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is warranted. TEE provides a more detailed and accurate assessment of the severity and etiology of AR, as well as the evaluation of the aortic valve, aortic root, and other cardiac structures. It can help determine the underlying cause of the AR, such as infective endocarditis or aortic dissection, which could explain the patient's clinical presentation. This will guide further management and treatment decisions for the patient.

Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's bilateral corneal verticillata and corneal crystals are likely a result of previous amiodarone use, as this medication is known to cause corneal deposits. Since the patient is no longer taking amiodarone and has been asymptomatic, reassurance is appropriate. Genetic testing, corneal scraping and culture, and laboratory testing for immunoglobulins are not necessary in this case.
Answer: D: Consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe progressive bilateral vision loss, photophobia, headaches, nausea, and papilledema is consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without evidence of any intracranial pathology. The initial treatment of IIH involves medical management with acetazolamide to decrease cerebrospinal fluid production and subsequently lower intracranial pressure. However, in cases where there is severe visual loss (as in this case) or evidence of rapidly progressive disease, surgical intervention may be necessary.

In this case, the patient has near-complete vision loss in both eyes and severe papilledema, which suggests tight compression of the optic nerves. Optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) is a surgical procedure that involves making small holes in the optic nerve sheath to release pressure and improve visual outcomes. However, ONSF is typically considered in patients with visual loss due to IIH who fail to respond to medical therapy or have contraindications to medication.

In this case, there is additional finding of bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST) on magnetic resonance venography. DVST is a rare but serious complication of IIH and can further contribute to increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, consulting neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement would be the most appropriate next step, as it would allow for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and potential resolution of the venous sinus thrombosis. Intravenous anticoagulation may also be considered in the management of DVST, but it should be initiated after neurosurgical evaluation to determine the best course of action. Serial lumbar punctures may temporarily lower intracranial pressure but are not a definitive treatment and would not address the underlying cause of the increased pressure.

Answer: D: Perform biopsy of lesion.

Explanation: The patient presents with a mass in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone that is causing proptosis and edema of the right temporal lobe. Given the lack of improvement with previous antibiotic therapy and the involvement of the temporal lobe, a biopsy of the lesion is warranted to determine the nature of the mass and guide further treatment. An MRI has already been performed to provide additional information about the lesion. A positron emission tomographic scan may be considered in the future for further staging or assessing treatment response, but biopsy is the next appropriate step. Intravenous antibiotics or corticosteroids may be indicated depending on the biopsy results.

The correct answer is D: Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor). 

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a verrucous, exophytic tumor with yellow drainage on the perianal skin, along with the histopathologic findings of hyperplastic epithelium, necrosis, dense inflammatory infiltrate, and plasma cells, is consistent with giant condyloma acuminatum, also known as Buschke-Löwenstein tumor. This tumor is a rare, sexually transmitted infection caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, commonly HPV 6 and 11. Giant condyloma acuminatum is locally invasive and can lead to significant morbidity if not treated promptly. It is often difficult to manage and resistant to standard therapies. Surgical excision or debulking is the treatment of choice, though adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy may also be used.

C: Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case are consistent with primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. The patient initially presented with scaly erythematous patches and plaques, which progressed rapidly to isolated painful tumors. The first biopsy showed an epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei, which were positive for T-cell gene rearrangements. The second biopsy showed an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD3+, CD4−, and CD8− weak lymphocytes, which were positive for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor 1. These findings are characteristic of primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. The other options, CD8+ mycosis fungoides, lymphomatoid papulosis, type D, and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, do not align with the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.
C

394
B: Angiosarcoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of an enlarging, tender, pruritic erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules on the forehead, along with the histological and immunohistochemical findings described, is consistent with angiosarcoma. Histopathological analysis revealed dissecting vascular channels and spindle cells, which are characteristic features of angiosarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining for CD31, FLI-1, and ERG showed diffuse expression in the vascular and spindle cell components, further supporting the diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Other options such as cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma would typically present with different clinical and histological features.

395
B: Consult interventional radiology for catheter-directed thrombolysis

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of syncope, calf pain, shortness of breath, and the findings of bilateral large pulmonary emboli with evidence of right heart thrombus on echocardiography indicate a high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). The appropriate next step would be to consult interventional radiology for catheter-directed thrombolysis. This procedure involves the administration of thrombolytic agents directly into the pulmonary arteries to dissolve the thrombus and restore blood flow. It is a less invasive alternative to systemic thrombolysis and is associated with lower bleeding risks. The patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and further management. Intravenous unfractionated heparin is appropriate for anticoagulation, but it alone may not be sufficient for the management of a high-risk PE in this patient. Controlled operative thrombectomy and systemic thrombolysis can be considered if interventional radiology is not available or unsuccessful, but they are more invasive options associated with higher risks.

396
B: Acromegaly 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including tonsillar hypertrophy, macroglossia, changes in facial structure (bite), growth in the tongue, and swelling in hands and feet, are consistent with the diagnosis of acromegaly. Acromegaly is a condition caused by excess growth hormone production usually due to a pituitary adenoma. It is characterized by abnormal enlargement of the extremities, facial features, and soft tissues, including the tonsils and tongue. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this patient is also commonly associated with acromegaly. Diagnosis can be confirmed through further hormonal evaluation and imaging studies such as an MRI of the pituitary gland.
B
397
The correct answer is A: Rosai-Dorfman disease.

Explanation: Rosai-Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare non-malignant disorder that primarily affects lymph nodes. It is characterized by painless, progressively enlarging lymphadenopathy, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers, as seen in this case. The diagnosis is often made through a combination of clinical and histopathological findings.

In this case, the patient initially presented with a left-sided neck mass, which failed to resolve with antibiotic treatment. Imaging studies revealed an enlarged lymph node in the left neck. The patient's symptoms, along with the persistence of the mass, prompted further evaluation.

Initial fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry did not show evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder or malignancy. A tissue culture also yielded negative results. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show malignant cells, leading to a decision for a left neck dissection. Finally, the pathologic examination of the resected lymph node revealed features consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease. The histological findings included regressed germinal centers, hyalinized vessels, and small lymphocytes in the mantle zone palisading around residual germinal centers.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological examination, the correct diagnosis for this case is A: Rosai-Dorfman disease.
D
398
B: Order a positron emission tomography scan

Explanation: The sudden onset of multiple green spots in the eyes of a patient with breast cancer, particularly after starting a new therapy, raises concern for ocular metastasis. To evaluate for metastatic disease, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan should be ordered. This will help determine the extent and location of metastases, including any involvement of the ocular structures. Based on the patient's ocular findings and the concern for possible metastatic disease, discontinuation of breast cancer treatment would not be recommended without further evaluation. Observation alone would not provide sufficient information about the cause of the green spots or the presence of ocular metastasis. An oral prednisone course may be considered if there are signs of inflammation or if other causes of the eye findings are suspected, but it would not definitively address the underlying etiology of the spots.

B: Obtain an electroretinogram

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical findings are suggestive of a bilateral maculopathy with central visual acuity loss. The presence of focal areas of gray-brown discoloration and disruption of the ellipsoid layer on optical coherence tomography (OCT) indicate retinal involvement. Obtaining an electroretinogram (ERG) can help evaluate the functional integrity of the photoreceptors and detect any abnormalities in their response to light stimuli. This can aid in establishing a diagnosis and guiding further management. Stopping psychiatric medications, inquiring about bright light exposures, or prescribing oral steroids may not be appropriate initial steps in evaluating this patient's condition.

B: Perform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent

Explanation: In this case, the patient has a history of advanced diabetes mellitus and presents with acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye, periorbital pain, an amaurotic pupil, severe restriction of extraocular movement, and ptosis. The orbital imaging shows inflammatory changes in the right orbital apex and paranasal sinuses. The sinus biopsy confirms the presence of fungal hyphal elements. These findings suggest a diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital involvement.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of fungal elements on biopsy, it is important to initiate systemic antifungal therapy promptly. Performing a transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of antifungal agents can help deliver the medication directly to the affected area, improving the chances of successful treatment and preserving vision. This intervention can be done while awaiting improvement in renal status and further imaging with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Orbital debridement or orbital exenteration may be considered in cases of extensive fungal invasion or failure of medical management. However, these are more invasive procedures and should be reserved for cases where conservative management has failed.

Answer: A: Basal cell carcinoma

Explanation: The presentation of an asymptomatic, translucent nodule on the nipple is highly suggestive of basal cell carcinoma. This type of skin cancer commonly occurs in sun-exposed areas and is characterized by translucent or pearly nodules. The family history of cutaneous melanoma and breast cancer is not directly related to the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. Dermoscopic examination showing arborizing vessels and erosion further supports the diagnosis. A punch biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis.

402
The diagnosis is B: Primary umbilical endometriosis.

Explanation: Primary umbilical endometriosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, specifically in the umbilicus. This condition occurs in women of reproductive age and can cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and the formation of nodules or masses in the umbilicus.

The clinical presentation of a solitary umbilical nodule with occasional pain and intermittent bleeding, along with the histopathologic findings of glandular epithelium and stromal tissue within the dermis, support the diagnosis of primary umbilical endometriosis.

Other options such as metastatic adenocarcinoma, urachal duct cyst, and omphalomesenteric duct remnant are less likely based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Metastatic adenocarcinoma would typically show different cytomorphology and immunohistochemical staining patterns, whereas urachal duct cyst and omphalomesenteric duct remnant would have different clinical and histopathologic characteristics.

403
The correct answer is C: Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea on exertion, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, right-sided heart failure, and the presence of pretibial edema are suggestive of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. The presence of extramammary Paget disease, as evidenced by the presence of scaly genital skin lesions, is important in making the correct diagnosis.

In this case, the autopsy findings reveal the presence of Paget cells in the lung, specifically within the intimal fibromuscular proliferation of the pulmonary arteries. The presence of embolized Paget cells confirms the diagnosis of pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM). PTTM is a rare but life-threatening complication of malignancies, such as lung adenocarcinoma in this patient.

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (option A) would present with left-sided heart failure symptoms such as pulmonary edema and crackles on pulmonary examination, which are not described in this case.

Sarcoidosis (option B) typically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, and non-caseating granulomas, which are not mentioned in this case.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (option D) would typically be associated with a history of acute pulmonary embolism, which is not described in this case. The absence of thromboembolism on imaging also argues against this diagnosis.

404
B: Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation and findings on echocardiography are consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency. Pericardiocentesis, the drainage of pericardial fluid, is the initial treatment for cardiac tamponade to relieve the pressure on the heart and improve cardiac output. The placement of a pericardial drain allows for continuous evacuation of the fluid and prevents re-accumulation. Urgent referral for cardiovascular surgery may be considered if the pericardiocentesis is not successful or if there are underlying structural causes of the effusion that require surgical intervention. Urgent vascular surgery referral for IVC stent removal is not warranted in this case, as the patient's symptoms are more likely related to the pericardial effusion. Finally, initiation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine may be used as adjunctive therapy for pericardial effusion, but they should not be the primary treatment for cardiac tamponade.

The correct answer is C: IgG4-related disease.

Explanation: IgG4-related disease is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by elevated serum IgG4 levels and infiltration of affected organs by IgG4-positive plasma cells. It can affect multiple organ systems, including the larynx. Patients typically present with non-specific symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, and odynophagia. In this case, the patient's symptoms, as well as the findings on nasolaryngoscopy and biopsy (increased plasma cell component, negative stains for infectious organisms), are consistent with IgG4-related laryngeal disease. Further confirmation can be obtained through immunohistochemical analysis. The full-body nuclear magnetic resonance positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan was performed to rule out systemic involvement, which is possible in IgG4-related disease.
C
406
The correct answer is A: Glomus tumor.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of nasal pain, radiating facial pain, nasal tenderness, and a submucosal lesion on the anterior nasal septum is consistent with a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare neoplasms that arise from the specialized glomus bodies located in the dermis of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa of the nasal cavity. They are typically benign but can be locally invasive. The symptoms of pain, tenderness, and worsening with exposure to cold temperatures are common findings in patients with glomus tumors. Surgical excision is the preferred treatment and provides definitive diagnosis. In this case, the excised specimen was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, which are characteristic findings of glomus tumors.
A
407
My diagnosis for this case is B: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Explanation: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as the kidneys. It commonly presents with nasal and sinus symptoms, such as nasal congestion and sinus pain, as well as pulmonary and renal involvement.

In this case, the patient presented with progressively worsening nasal congestion and dysphonia over the past 2 years, along with a history of asthma. Physical examination findings of dysphonia, obstructive nasal polyps, and laryngeal masses are consistent with upper airway involvement. Computed tomography showed laryngeal lesions and subglottic stenosis, which are characteristic findings of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

The laryngeal mass biopsy showed vacuolated macrophages with bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells, which are typical histopathological findings in granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The presence of these findings supports the diagnosis.

Amyloidosis (choice A), rhinoscleroma (choice C), and sarcoidosis (choice D) are less likely in this case based on the clinical presentation and specific findings mentioned. Amyloidosis typically presents with deposits of abnormal protein (amyloid) in the extracellular spaces, which is not described in this case. Rhinoscleroma is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, which typically presents with granulomatous inflammation, but the clinical findings and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can involve multiple organs, including the lungs, but the specific findings of obstructive nasal polyps and laryngeal masses with subglottic stenosis are not typical of sarcoidosis.
C
408
C: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a palatal swelling with focal ulceration, its involvement of the right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate, and the lack of pain or discomfort are consistent with a neoplastic process. The histopathological findings of sheets of large lymphocytes with round to oval nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and positive staining with CD20, CD45, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies are characteristic of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign salivary gland tumor that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the major or minor salivary glands. Angioleiomyoma is a benign smooth muscle tumor that commonly occurs in the submucosal layer of the oral cavity and presents as a slowly enlarging, well-circumscribed mass. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor and typically presents as a painless, slow-growing mass in the major or minor salivary glands.
C
409
D: Pneumoparotid

Explanation: Pneumoparotid is a condition characterized by the presence of air within the parotid gland, usually due to retrograde airflow from the oral cavity into the salivary ducts. In this case, the patient's habit of forcing air into his neck and decompressing it back into the oral cavity likely caused the air to enter the parotid duct, leading to pneumoparotid. The subsequent dissection of air into the parapharyngeal and masticator spaces, as well as the subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum), can be seen on the CT scan. The presence of otalgia, periauricular swelling, facial swelling, tender fluctuant neck pocket, and crepitus support the diagnosis of pneumoparotid.
D
410
D: Reassure the patient and observe.

Explanation: The presence of bilateral, peripheral, small corneal opacities in this patient is likely due to rifabutin-related posterior corneal deposits. These deposits are a known side effect of rifabutin treatment and are typically asymptomatic. Given that the patient has no visual concerns and the opacities are not affecting her visual acuity, treatment with topical corticosteroids or antibiotics is not necessary. Additionally, a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy would be invasive and not warranted in this case. Therefore, reassuring the patient and observing for any changes or worsening of symptoms would be the most appropriate course of action.

B: Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of cyclical fevers, muscle pain, joint swelling, headache, and blurry vision, it is important to rule out infectious and inflammatory causes. Conducting blood tests for infectious agents such as bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, as well as testing for inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), can help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. This will aid in determining the appropriate course of treatment. Magnetic resonance angiography of the neck and observation may be considered depending on the results of the blood tests. Treatment with oral prednisone may be initiated if there is evidence of inflammation, but this should be guided by the specific diagnosis.

I would choose option C: Perform anterior chamber paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction.

Explanation: Given the presence of conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate, it is important to investigate the possibility of an infectious etiology, such as viral infection. Performing anterior chamber paracentesis and sending a sample for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can help identify any viral pathogens that may be causing the symptoms. This will provide valuable information for appropriate management and treatment of the condition.

B: Perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) 

Explanation: HRM is the best next step in the evaluation of this patient. The clinical presentation of intermittent dysphagia to solids, especially meats, along with the presence of vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus on EGD, are suggestive of esophageal motility disorder such as eosinophilic esophagitis or achalasia. HRM is a diagnostic test that can evaluate esophageal motility and provide more information about the functioning of the esophagus, which will help to differentiate between different causes of dysphagia.

My diagnosis is C: Linear IgA dermatosis. 

Explanation: Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that typically presents as annular or targetoid plaques with raised erythematous margins. The presence of multiple concentric annular formations with blisters and pustules, as described in the case, is consistent with this diagnosis. Linear IgA dermatosis most commonly affects middle-aged or older adults and can be triggered by medications, infections, or underlying diseases. In this case, the patient's history of recent surgery and use of medications may have contributed to the development of the condition. The negative findings on routine laboratory studies, as well as negative staining and culture results, further support the diagnosis of Linear IgA dermatosis.

416
Based on the description and the provided images, the most likely diagnosis is C: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

Explanation:
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, slow-growing tumor that originates from the dermis of the skin. It commonly presents as a firm, raised lump that can slowly enlarge over time. DFSP often affects the trunk, extremities, or head and neck region, and it can cause facial asymmetry, as seen in the patient's case.

Histopathological analysis of the surgical pathology specimens revealed an interstitial proliferation of spindle cells within mature adipocytes, which is consistent with the characteristic findings of DFSP. These spindle cells separate the mature adipocytes and are associated with fragments of thickened collagen.

The other answer options are less likely to be the correct diagnosis. Lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus) typically presents with a more diffuse involvement of the subcutaneous tissue and is associated with other systemic symptoms of lupus. Spindle cell lipomas usually occur as solitary, well-circumscribed tumors, and they do not typically involve the nasal ala or cause deviation of the nasal tip. Diffuse pattern neurofibroma typically presents as irregular thickening and deformity of the skin, rather than a localized asymmetry.

417
B: Chronic bullous disease of childhood

Explanation: The presentation of recurrent skin blisters starting at a young age and involving the face, hands, and feet, along with pruritus and redness, suggests a diagnosis of chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC). CBDC, also known as linear IgA dermatosis, is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects children. It is characterized by the presence of tense blisters and vesicles on a background of erythema. The involvement of the mucosae and nails is typically absent. Biopsy findings typically show a subepidermal blister with a band-like mast cell infiltrate in the upper dermis. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a genetic disorder characterized by fragility and blistering of the skin. Bullous mastocytosis is the presence of blisters due to increased mast cells, which is usually seen in children with systemic mastocytosis. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is a rare metabolic disorder that primarily affects the skin and is characterized by fragility and blistering. Neither of these conditions fit the clinical presentation.

B: Commence treatment with oral olanzapine.

Explanation: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, including first-episode psychosis. It is effective in reducing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. It is also commonly used in the treatment of acute agitation and can help improve sleep and anxiety symptoms. Olanzapine has a favorable side effect profile compared to older antipsychotic medications, although it can cause weight gain and metabolic changes. It is important to consider the risk of adverse events when choosing a medication, and olanzapine is a suitable option for this patient based on the symptoms described.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is D: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with HLH, which is a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by fever, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and organomegaly. The elevated levels of ferritin and LDH, along with pancytopenia, suggest a hematologic disorder. The diffuse hypercaptation seen in the bone marrow and spleen on PET-CT imaging supports the diagnosis of HLH.

In contrast, option A (Infectious bone-marrow disease) would present with evidence of infection or inflammatory markers, which are not mentioned in the case. Option B (Bone marrow-liver-spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma) and option C (Primary bone lymphoma) would typically present with localized findings, such as bone lesions or lymphadenopathy, which are not described in the case.

It is important to note that HLH is a life-threatening condition and early recognition is crucial for prompt treatment and management.

B: Ambulatory cardiac monitoring after electrolyte repletion

Explanation: The patient presents with wide complex tachycardia, which could be due to electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Given her history of bulimia and the presence of electrolyte derangements, it is important to replenish the electrolytes and monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm over a period of time to assess for any recurrence of arrhythmias. Ambulatory cardiac monitoring, such as a Holter monitor, would provide continuous ECG monitoring for an extended period, allowing the medical team to capture any arrhythmias that may occur beyond the initial presentation. This would help in determining the best course of further management for the patient.

Answer: D: Macrocystic lymphatic malformation

Explanation: The description of a large soft and fluctuant submucosal mass involving multiple structures in the larynx, as well as the absence of craniofacial abnormalities or obvious oral cavity, oropharyngeal, or neck masses, is suggestive of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. These malformations are congenital abnormalities characterized by the cystic dilation of lymphatic channels. They can occur in various locations, including the head and neck region. In this case, the mass is causing airway obstruction, resulting in stridor and respiratory distress. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed to visualize and evaluate the extent of the mass.
C
422
The correct answer is D: Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, history of previous malignancies, and imaging findings are suggestive of a malignant tumor. The histopathologic assessment showed myogenin-positive spindle cells, which is consistent with spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. The tumor infiltrated into the fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone, further supporting this diagnosis.
D
423
The correct answer is B: Thyroglossal duct cyst.

Explanation: A thyroid nodule, also known as a thyroglossal duct cyst, is a common congenital anomaly that arises due to the persistence of the thyroglossal duct during embryonic development. It typically presents as a painless, slow-growing, and smooth subcutaneous nodule in the midline of the neck, superior to the sternal notch. Dermoscopy may show scattered telangiectatic vessels over the papule. Ultrasonography can help in the characterization of the lesion by confirming its superficial location without tracking into deeper tissues.

The other answer options are less likely in this case. Eruptive vellus hair cysts usually present as multiple papules with a central pore and are not typically congenital. Cutaneous bronchogenic cysts are rare and would most likely present with respiratory symptoms. Midline anterior neck inclusion cysts, also known as dermoid cysts, usually present with a visible pore and may be associated with overlying skin changes.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a thyroglossal duct cyst.
D
424
The correct answer is B: Hibernoma.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic examination, the diagnosis in this case is hibernoma. Hibernomas are rare benign soft tissue tumors that typically present as slow-growing masses in the head and neck region. They are composed of well-differentiated brown fat cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, centrally placed nuclei, and distinct cellular membranes. Hibernomas can often be diagnosed definitively based on histopathologic examination and do not typically require further treatment after surgical excision. In this case, the patient's symptoms, including neck pain and dysphagia, are likely related to the size and location of the hibernoma, rather than the migraines.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture.

Explanation: Sudden vision loss in a patient with pancytopenia and acute promyelocytic leukemia could be due to several reasons, including leukemic infiltration, hemorrhage, infection, or posterior segment ischemia. Considering the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the presence of choroidal effusions, serous retinal detachments, and intraretinal hemorrhages suggests the possibility of leukemic infiltrates in the eye. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes, such as central nervous system involvement.

Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast can help evaluate for any intraocular or intracranial pathology that may be causing the vision loss. Additionally, performing a lumbar puncture can help assess for cerebrospinal fluid involvement and exclude other causes. Once the imaging and lumbar puncture results are available, further management can be determined.

I would choose answer option C: Administer intravitreal foscarnet and initiate valganciclovir.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including painless vision loss, anterior chamber inflammation, iris neovascularization, and granular necrotizing retinitis, is consistent with viral retinitis. The patient's history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and recent bone marrow transplant indicate limited immune dysfunction, putting the patient at risk for opportunistic infections.

Given the presence of vitritis and necrotizing retinitis, intravitreal foscarnet therapy is indicated to directly target the viral infection in the eye. Foscarnet is effective against cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is a common cause of viral retinitis in immunocompromised individuals.

Additionally, initiation of oral valganciclovir is important for systemic treatment of CMV infection and prevention of dissemination. Both intravitreal foscarnet and systemic valganciclovir have been shown to be effective in the treatment of CMV retinitis.

Therefore, administering intravitreal foscarnet and initiating valganciclovir would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

B: Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's medical history of CLL/SLL and bladder cancer, along with the lack of response to oral prednisone therapy, there is concern for a possible malignant neoplasm. Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion to obtain a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

Answer: A: Start topical antibiotics

Explanation: Based on the bacterial culture results showing the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli, starting topical antibiotics would be the appropriate initial treatment option. MRSA is a common cause of infectious keratitis and topical antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for bacterial keratitis. Oral antiviral therapy is not necessary in this case as the viral polymerase chain reaction and potassium hydroxide tests were negative. Intravenous antiviral therapy is also not indicated at this point as there is no evidence of viral infection.

429
The answer option is: D: Refer to a nutritionist for education on gluten-free diet.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and protein-losing enteropathy, along with the findings of duodenal mucosal abnormalities on biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The patient's unintentional weight loss and normocytic anemia also support the possibility of celiac disease.

Referring the patient to a nutritionist for education on a gluten-free diet is the appropriate next step. A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of treatment for celiac disease, as it helps to reduce inflammation and promote gut healing. Following a strict gluten-free diet can alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent long-term complications associated with celiac disease.

Antimicrobial therapy (A) and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (B) are not indicated based on the clinical presentation and findings. There is no evidence to suggest an infectious etiology or immunodeficiency in this case.

Performing genetic analysis for evaluation of hematologic malignancy (C) is not warranted as there are no indications or findings suggestive of a hematologic malignancy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to refer the patient to a nutritionist for education on a gluten-free diet (D).

C: Order polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris 

Explanation: The patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging results are suggestive of biliary ascariasis, which is caused by the intestinal parasitic worm Ascaris lumbricoides. The finding of worms during ERCP further supports this diagnosis. To confirm the presence of Ascaris, a PCR assay can be ordered, which has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting the DNA of the parasite. This would confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Anthelminthic therapy, in the form of albendazole or mebendazole, can then be initiated to treat the infection. Antibiotics are not indicated in the case of biliary ascariasis.
B

431
C: Discontinue ibuprofen.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a similar eruption in the past after taking ibuprofen and the current presentation of painful and pruritic blisters on the lower lip, it is likely that this is an adverse reaction to ibuprofen. Discontinuing ibuprofen would be the most appropriate next step in managing this case. Administration of valacyclovir, discontinuing cosmetics, or administering antibiotics would not address the underlying cause of the eruption.
C

432
The answer is A: Onchocerciasis

Explanation: The presence of a solitary nodule on the labia, along with the characteristic presentation of a rubbery tumor and the absence of enlarged lymph nodes, is suggestive of onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. The histopathologic analysis of the lesional biopsy also supports this diagnosis, showing transepidermal elimination of basophilic oval-shaped structures and a dense inflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis.
B
cellvalue empty
433
The answer is C: Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.

Explanation: Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is a rare benign vascular proliferation that typically presents as a solitary, 1- to 3-cm red-brown or violaceous cutaneous nodule or papule on the head and neck, including the earlobe. It commonly affects young to middle-aged adults, and the lesions may be pruritic or tender. Histopathologic examination shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate involving the full thickness of the vessel wall, accompanied by lymphocytes, eosinophils, and often vascular proliferation with an onion-skin pattern. Diagnosis is based on the clinical and histopathologic findings, and additional tests are usually unnecessary. The condition typically runs a benign clinical course, with spontaneous resolution within a few years, although recurrence is common.

434
The correct answer is B: Lung abscess.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a lung abscess. The patient has a history of headache, double vision, seizures, and altered consciousness, which are consistent with a neurological infection. The presence of clubbing in the fingers and toes suggests a chronic underlying condition.

The cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows ring-enhancing lesions in the frontal and parietal cortexes, indicating abscesses. The central liquefaction within the lesions and the restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted MRI further support the diagnosis of abscesses.

The radiograph of the chest shows a nodular shadow in the left middle lung field, suggesting the presence of a lung abscess. Additionally, the low oxygen saturation level on arterial blood gas testing may be attributed to the lung abscess causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Other potential differential diagnoses, such as encysted empyema thoracis, pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, and bronchogenic carcinoma, are less likely based on the clinical and imaging findings given in the case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a lung abscess.
C

435
Based on the symptoms described and the MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is C: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

Explanation: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, which leads to defective cholesterol metabolism. It is characterized by the accumulation of cholestanol in various tissues, including the brain, tendons, and lenses of the eyes.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, as he exhibits cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, balance instability, and the presence of painless masses in the Achilles tendons. Additionally, the brain MRI findings of bilateral, symmetric abnormal signals in the internal capsules, cerebral peduncles, pons, and cerebellar dentate nuclei are consistent with the characteristic findings of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

Frontotemporal dementia (A) typically presents with progressive changes in behavior, personality, and language, but it does not typically present with the specific MRI findings seen in this case.

Wilson disease (B) is a genetic disorder characterized by copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver and brain. The presenting symptoms in Wilson disease are primarily hepatic and neurological, and do not typically include Achilles tendon masses or the specific MRI findings seen in this case.

Autoimmune encephalitis (D) is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain, leading to neurological symptoms. While behavioral changes and cognitive impairment can occur in autoimmune encephalitis, the specific MRI findings seen in this case are not typically associated with this condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is C: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.

436
B: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and jugular venous distension, along with the presence of an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle on echocardiogram, a cardiac MRI is the next appropriate step in the workup. Cardiac MRI can provide detailed imaging of the heart, including assessment of myocardial morphology, function, and tissue characterization. It can help evaluate for conditions such as myocardial ischemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative or restrictive cardiomyopathies, and myocardial fibrosis, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms of heart failure. Endomyocardial biopsy, whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan, and genetic testing for noncompaction are not the most appropriate next steps in this case as they may not provide the necessary information to guide management.
B

437
The correct answer is B: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.

Explanation: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are rare neoplasms that can occur in various locations, including the larynx. They are characterized by the presence of spindle-shaped cells with variable atypia and a background of inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes and plasma cells. IMTs typically have a myxoid and fibrous stroma with abundant blood vessels. In this case, the patient presented with a recurrent vocal fold mass that was initially thought to be a polyp. However, subsequent imaging and pathology revealed the characteristic features of an IMT. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis, showing reactivity for vimentin and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1 (ALK1). Treatment typically involves surgical excision. In this case, the patient had no recurrent disease for the past 3 years, indicating a successful outcome.
B
438
The correct answer is D: Glial heterotopia. 

Explanation: Glial heterotopia is a rare condition characterized by the presence of normal glial tissue in abnormal locations outside the central nervous system. In this case, the posterior neck mass in the infant was found to have cells resembling glial tissue with positive immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, S100, NeuN, and synaptophysin. The mass infiltrated the paraspinal musculature and showed no discrete capsule. These findings are consistent with glial heterotopia rather than other possibilities such as lipoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or infantile hemangioma.
D
439
The diagnosis is C: Posttraumatic central motor impairment. 

Explanation: The patient experienced severe head trauma resulting in a right frontal epidural hematoma. The hematoma was surgically evacuated, and her Glasgow Coma Score improved postoperatively. However, on postoperative day 2, she developed isolated dysphagia and dysphonia with right vocal cord paralysis observed on laryngoscopic examination. Computed tomographic images with contrast revealed thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, causing acute compression of the recurrent nerve as it follows the course of the cranial accessory nerve and then the vagus nerve. This compression likely led to the posttraumatic central motor impairment, specifically affecting the motor function of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, resulting in right vocal cord paralysis and subsequent dysphagia and dysphonia.
B
440
The answer is C: Kimura disease.

Explanation: Kimura disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder that predominantly affects young Asian males. Although the patient in this case is a Hispanic female, Kimura disease can occur in other ethnic groups as well. The characteristic clinical features include painless, subcutaneous, subcutaneous nodules or masses commonly found in the head and neck region. The nodules are usually accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy.

The physical examination findings in this case, including the painless, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations, are consistent with Kimura disease. The presence of eosinophilia, as seen in the patient's absolute eosinophil count and eosinophilia percentage, is also characteristic of the disease. The imaging findings on the postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing a heterogeneously enhancing mass further support the diagnosis.

The histopathological examination of the excised mass confirmed the diagnosis of Kimura disease. The presence of reactive follicular hyperplasia, eosinophilia, eosinophilic microabscesses, and follicular cysts are all characteristic features of Kimura disease.

Hodgkin lymphoma can present with lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, but it is less likely in this case due to the absence of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) and the specific histopathological findings seen in Kimura disease.

Mastoiditis is characterized by inflammation and infection of the mastoid bone. It typically presents with ear pain, erythema, and tenderness in the mastoid region, which are not present in this case.

Brachial cleft cysts are congenital anomalies that present as cystic masses in the head and neck region, typically along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. They are not associated with eosinophilia and do not show the characteristic histopathological findings seen in Kimura disease.
C
441
B: Repeat the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. 

Explanation: Given the patient's relapsing symptoms and previous findings of optic nerve thickening and enhancement, as well as leptomeningeal thickening, it would be appropriate to repeat the MRI of the brain to assess for any changes or progression of the disease. This imaging modality can provide valuable information about the extent and severity of the pathology.

442
C: Sweep the superior fornix.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to sweep the superior fornix. The presence of a pseudomembrane on the tarsal conjunctiva suggests chronic inflammation and possible adhesion formation, which can contribute to the ptosis, blepharedema, and discharge. Sweeping the superior fornix can help disrupt these adhesions and improve the patient's symptoms. This procedure can be performed in the office under topical anesthesia. Systemic steroids or surgical interventions like dacryocystorhinostomy or canaliculotomy are not warranted at this time, as the patient's symptoms have improved with initial treatment and the primary issue appears to be related to conjunctival inflammation.
C
cellvalue empty
443
B: Perform an incision and drainage

Explanation: Given the presence of a focally ulcerated nodule with associated symptoms of erythema, tenderness, and yellow discharge, an incision and drainage procedure would be the appropriate next step. This will allow for drainage of any infected material and potential relief of symptoms. Treatment with hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment may also be considered as adjunctive therapy to promote healing and prevent infection. However, a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins is not warranted based on the information provided. A corticosteroid injection would not be effective in this case as the main concern is infection, not inflammation.

D: Order additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay).

Explanation: The patient's presentation with multiple hemorrhages, normocytic anemia, mild leukopenia, and peripheral edema suggests an underlying bleeding disorder. Ordering additional coagulation tests such as thrombin time and platelet function assay can help identify any coagulation abnormalities or platelet dysfunction that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This will provide valuable information for further management and treatment decisions.

The answer option would be D: Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.

Explanation: The patient's POC INR is elevated at 3.7, indicating that the dose of warfarin may be too high. Before making any adjustments to the current warfarin dosing, it is important to confirm the POC INR results with a plasma INR test, which is considered the gold standard for INR measurement accuracy. This will help ensure that the POC INR result is accurate and not influenced by any technical issues or errors. Based on the results of the plasma INR test, appropriate adjustments to the warfarin dosage can be made.

446
C: Switch to intravenous esmolol drip.

Explanation: In this case, the patient is presenting with recurrent narrow complex tachycardia, which has been previously diagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The initial attempts to convert the rhythm using a modified Valsalva maneuver and intravenous adenosine have been unsuccessful. The subsequent administration of intravenous metoprolol and intravenous diltiazem did not terminate the arrhythmia.

Since the patient has already been treated with diltiazem without success, it would be appropriate to switch to an alternative medication. Esmolol, a short-acting beta-1 selective blocker, is a reasonable choice in this situation. It can be administered intravenously as a drip to control the heart rate and potentially terminate the arrhythmia.

Therefore, the next step would be to stop the diltiazem drip and switch to intravenous esmolol drip (option C).

The correct answer is B: Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of coalescent yellowish papules around the umbilicus and the presence of clumped eosinophilic elastic fibers in the middermis on histological examination are consistent with periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis. This condition is a variant of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and is characterized by elastolysis in the papillary dermis, leading to the development of yellowish papules. PXE is a heritable disorder of elastic tissue resulting in the accumulation of abnormal elastic fibers in various organs. However, in this case, there is no evidence of systemic involvement or typical features of PXE on dermoscopy, such as follicular plugging or linear vessels. Late-onset focal dermal elastosis (choice D) typically presents as yellowish-white, asymptomatic papules on sun-exposed areas in older individuals, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa (choice C) presents with annular lesions with central clearing and prominent follicular plugging. Therefore, periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis (choice B) is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

The diagnosis for this case is C: Merkel cell carcinoma.

Explanation: Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that usually presents as a painless, erythematous, rapidly growing nodule on sun-exposed skin in the elderly population. In this case, the patient presented with an asymptomatic, enlarging, partly infiltrated erythematous cutaneous patch localized to the periareolar area of her left breast. The skin biopsy showed a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement and large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm, which are characteristic findings of Merkel cell carcinoma. This diagnosis should be suspected in elderly patients with rapidly growing skin lesions and should be confirmed with immunohistochemical studies.

449
The correct answer is C: Chorea-acanthocytosis.

Explanation: Chorea-acanthocytosis is a rare neurological disorder characterized by chorea (involuntary, jerky movements) and the presence of acanthocytes (abnormally shaped red blood cells) in the blood smear. The symptoms in this case, including orofacial dyskinesia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting, are consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis.

Other findings in this case that support the diagnosis of chorea-acanthocytosis include diminished or absent deep reflexes, mild cognitive decline, wide-based gait, elevated creatine kinase levels, and neurogenic damage observed in the electromyogram. Additionally, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral caudate head atrophy, which is a characteristic feature of chorea-acanthocytosis.

Pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration (A) is a type of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and typically presents with dystonia, spasticity, and cognitive impairment. Hypobetalipoproteinemia (B) refers to low levels of low-density lipoprotein and is not associated with the neurological symptoms described in this case. Huntington disease–like 2 (D) is a subtype of genetic mutation that leads to a Huntington's disease-like condition, but it usually presents with adult-onset chorea and may have additional features like dystonia or parkinsonism.

The next step would be A: Transthoracic echocardiogram.

Explanation: The suspicious posterior orientation of the ventricular lead on chest radiography raises concerns for left ventricular placement. This should be confirmed or ruled out with a transthoracic echocardiogram, which can provide detailed imaging of the heart and its structures. A left ventricular lead placement can cause ineffective atrial function and may increase the risk of thrombus formation, leading to recurrent strokes. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram is necessary to assess the position of the ventricular lead and evaluate cardiac function.

Based on the presented case, the most appropriate next step would be A: Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical test.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painless, gradually declining vision along with a family history of vitreous hemorrhage and glaucoma warrant further investigation. Aqueous humor biopsy can help determine the presence of any abnormal cells or biochemical markers that may be causing the vitreous opacity. This test can provide valuable information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further management.

454
B: Subungual squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a painful subungual mass, destruction of the distal nail plate with onycholysis, and the histopathological findings of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and atypical mitosis are consistent with subungual squamous cell carcinoma. Onychomycosis typically does not present as a painful mass, and the mycological examination was unremarkable. Subungual verruca vulgaris is caused by human papillomavirus infection and usually presents as a wart-like lesion with hyperkeratosis, which was not observed in this case. Subungual exostosis is a benign bony lesion that results in nail plate deformity, but it is not associated with the described histopathological features.

D: Test for serum cryoglobulin level.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of widespread purpura, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and progression of lymphoma is concerning for cutaneous vasculitis. Cryoglobulinemia, an immune complex-mediated vasculitis, can be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, including extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Testing for serum cryoglobulin levels can help confirm the diagnosis. The other options, such as administering empirical intravenous antibiotics, administering protein C concentrate, and calculating a calcium-phosphate product, are not appropriate in this context as they do not align with the patient's clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis.

456
My diagnosis is D: Sarcoidosis.

Explanation: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas. It commonly affects the lungs, but can also involve the skin, eyes, liver, and other organs. The clinical presentation of pink-purple papules on the trunk and extremities, along with the preference for extensor surfaces, is consistent with cutaneous involvement in sarcoidosis.

The patient's history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion, along with weight loss, may also be indicative of systemic involvement. The pulmonary function testing showing mild restrictive disease further supports the diagnosis.

The skin biopsy results, showing a nodular to diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with admixed atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes, are also consistent with sarcoidosis.

Other potential diagnoses such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, granuloma annulare, and small-vessel vasculitis are less likely based on the clinical and biopsy findings described in the case.

D: Nevus comedonicus

Explanation: Nevus comedonicus is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by the presence of grouped and circumscribed papules with central keratotic plugging, resembling open comedones. These papules are usually localized to one area of the body, commonly the face, neck, chest, and upper back. In this case, the patient presented with asymptomatic, punctate, keratotic papules localized to the right palm and right third proximal finger since childhood. The histopathology findings, showing dilated follicular infundibulum with keratinous core and absent hair shaft, are consistent with nevus comedonicus. Prior treatments with cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, and salicylic acid suggest an attempt to clear the lesions, but incomplete clearance was achieved.

458
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is D: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody.

Explanation:
ADEM is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder that typically occurs following an infection or vaccination. It often presents with a subacute onset of neurological deficits, such as weakness, numbness, ataxia, and visual disturbances. The progression of symptoms over time, as described in this case, is consistent with ADEM.

The MRI findings of a lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass in the brainstem, with persistent yet evolving enhancement and mild size increase in subsequent imaging, are also characteristic of ADEM.

Other potential diagnoses can be ruled out based on the negative laboratory results and the specific imaging findings. Sarcoidosis (A) would typically show granulomas in the biopsy and elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Erdheim-Chester disease (B) presents with symmetric sclerosis of long bones and multiorgan involvement, which is not seen in this case. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (C) would typically show a mass lesion with homogeneous enhancement on MRI, which is not consistent with the imaging findings in this case.

In conclusion, based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is D: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody.

460
The correct answer is B: Branchial cleft cyst.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a mass in the neck along with facial dysmorphism, feeding difficulty, failure to thrive, and a vallecular cyst is consistent with a diagnosis of a branchial cleft cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are congenital abnormalities that result from incomplete obliteration of the branchial clefts during embryologic development. They typically present with a painless, fluctuant, non-tender mass in the lateral neck. In this case, the cyst is most likely a second branchial cleft cyst, given its location in the neck and association with a vallecular cyst. The presence of a vallecular cyst in this patient with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is not unexpected, as patients with this syndrome can have various congenital anomalies, including branchial arch and pouch anomalies. The patient's lack of a thymus on MRI is also consistent with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass would be appropriate for confirmation of the diagnosis and ruling out more concerning lesions, such as rhabdomyosarcoma.
C
461
B: Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography

Explanation: The patient's presentation with bilateral retinal detachments, along with constitutional symptoms and signs of systemic inflammation, is concerning for an underlying systemic condition. Given the patient's history of fevers, chills, and coughing, it is important to rule out infectious causes such as tuberculosis (TB) or syphilis. The Quantiferon test is a blood test used to detect tuberculosis infection, while the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is a screening test for syphilis. Chest radiography can help evaluate for signs of active TB infection. These tests are important to guide the diagnosis and management of the underlying systemic condition, which may be contributing to the retinal detachments.

D: Discontinue antibiotics and avoid all medications associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with a drug reaction, specifically Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which is characterized by mucocutaneous involvement. Discontinuing the causative medications, in this case, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is crucial to prevent worsening of the symptoms. Continuing the antibiotics or initiating topical ophthalmic antibiotics can potentially exacerbate the reaction. It is important to avoid all medications associated with SJS until a definitive diagnosis can be made and additional treatment options can be considered.

465
The answer is C: Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis.

Explanation: The patient developed multiple joint deformities after starting nivolumab treatment, which suggests a potential drug-induced inflammatory arthritis. The timeline between the initiation of nivolumab and the onset of symptoms is consistent with a drug-related adverse event. The patient had a partial response to intra-articular steroids, indicating an inflammatory component to the joint disease. The absence of significant autoantibody markers, such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody, suggests a diagnosis of seronegative arthritis. The presence of synovitis, tenosynovitis, and osseous erosions on magnetic resonance imaging further supports an inflammatory etiology. Erosive osteoarthritis and metastatic bone disease are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

B: Order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of chronic joint pain and stiffness, along with the presence of soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae, further evaluation is warranted. The elevated levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) suggest a possible underlying kidney involvement. Therefore, ordering serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay can help identify any abnormal protein patterns or markers associated with systemic diseases such as multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, which can present with joint symptoms and proteinuria. This will provide valuable information for the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.

B: Perform a point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test via fingerstick to determine the patient’s glycemic status.

Explanation: Given the patient's concerns about diabetes and risk factors such as obesity and hypertension, it is appropriate to screen for diabetes. The POC HbA1c test is a reliable indicator of long-term glycemic control and can be conveniently performed in the office via a fingerstick. This test can provide information about the patient's average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, helping to determine his glycemic status. The laboratory-based glucose test may not provide a comprehensive picture of the patient's glycemic control, as it only measures blood glucose levels at a specific point in time. The laboratory-based HbA1c test is not necessary if a POC HbA1c test is available. It is important to note that a diagnosis of diabetes should not be solely based on the results of a single test, and additional confirmatory testing may be required.

The correct answer is B: Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: Based on the history and clinical presentation, the patient is presenting with dry scaly patches on the trunk, arms, and legs, which are consistent with ichthyosis. Additionally, multiple dome-shaped red papules and nodules on the upper back are described. Enlarged lymph nodes are also observed. The biopsy specimen shows atypical cells and focal areas of epidermotropism, which are characteristic features of mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In this case, the presence of ichthyosis in combination with mycosis fungoides is referred to as ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides. Other options such as cutaneous pseudolymphoma, ichthyosis vulgaris with atopic dermatitis, and large plaque parapsoriasis do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings described.

B: Annular atrophic lichen planus

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of 1- to 2-cm slightly erythematous annular atrophic plaques with raised rims, white scale, and depressed and wrinkled centers is consistent with annular atrophic lichen planus. This is a variant of lichen planus that commonly affects the breasts. The characteristic annular morphology, atrophy, and variable scaling are indicative of this condition. Erythema annulare centrifugum typically presents with erythematous borders that expand centrifugally and tends to resolve spontaneously. Porokeratosis presents with raised borders and a central atrophic area, while granuloma annulare exhibits annular plaques without atrophic centers.

The correct diagnosis is D: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula.

Explanation: The patient presents with a progressive myelopathy characterized by lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. The MRI of the total spine shows a long-segment, expansile T2 hyperintense lesion with extensive ill-defined enhancement of the spinal cord. These findings suggest a vascular abnormality, specifically a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). SDAVF is a rare vascular malformation in which an abnormal connection forms between an artery and a vein within the spinal dura mater. It can cause progressive neurological symptoms due to venous congestion and impaired blood flow to the spinal cord.

The other answer options are not consistent with the clinical presentation or imaging findings: 
- A: Postinfectious myelopathy would typically have evidence of infection or inflammation, which was not found in this case.
- B: Toxic myelopathy would require exposure to a specific toxin, which was denied by the patient.
- C: Glioma would typically present with a focal mass lesion, whereas the imaging findings in this case are more consistent with a diffuse abnormality.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings is a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula.

I would choose option B: Right and left heart catheterization.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea and neck fullness, along with the auscultatory findings of a diastolic sound, the possibility of heart failure with associated elevated jugular venous pressure and hepatomegaly is of concern. Right and left heart catheterization would help in assessing the hemodynamics of the heart, including the measurement of pulmonary artery pressures, right atrial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This would provide valuable information to determine the presence and severity of heart failure and guide further management decisions. Transesophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, and liver biopsy may be considered later depending on the findings from the heart catheterization.

472
A: Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass 

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms and the findings on mammogram and ultrasound, the next step would be to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis to be made and determine if further treatment, such as excision, is necessary. A biopsy is the standard approach in evaluating breast masses, especially in men where breast cancer is less common but still possible.

473
The correct answer is D: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Explanation: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe and potentially life-threatening skin condition that is often triggered by a medication or infection. It is characterized by widespread desquamatory lesions affecting the skin and mucous membranes, including the oral cavity, lips, and eyes. The upper aerodigestive tract mucosa can also be involved, leading to symptoms like dysphagia and dysphonia.

In this case, the patient had macules and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, as well as hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera. The nasofibroscopy results showed generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa, especially affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa. The previous similar clinical event and response to corticosteroid treatment also suggest a recurrent and inflammatory condition like Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Option D).
C
474
The diagnosis is C: Papillary adenocarcinoma.

Explanation: The patient presented with a nasopharyngeal mass causing progressive bilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. The mass had a pedunculated appearance on nasopharyngoscopy and was well-defined on CT imaging. Histopathological analysis showed tumor cells arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and nuclear grooves, consistent with the diagnostic features of papillary adenocarcinoma. Further investigations, including MRI, PET-CT, and ultrasound, did not reveal evidence of cancer recurrence or metastasis. The absence of residual tumor and the lack of recurrence at the 12-month postoperative follow-up support the diagnosis of papillary adenocarcinoma.
C
475
The correct answer is C: Pemphigus vulgaris.

Explanation: Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3, which are proteins involved in the adhesion of keratinocytes. This leads to the loss of cell-cell adhesion and the formation of intraepithelial blisters. Pemphigus vulgaris commonly presents with painful and pruritic ulcerative lesions on the mucous membranes, such as the oral cavity and oropharynx, as well as on the skin. The biopsy findings show a characteristic lace-like pattern of autoantibody deposition in the intraepithelial matrix. The positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result is likely a coincidental finding and not related to the patient's current presentation.

A: Squamous cell carcinoma is a form of skin cancer that typically presents as a localized, non-healing ulceration and is not associated with autoantibody deposition.

B: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection that can present with mucocutaneous lesions, but the clinical and histological findings are inconsistent with this diagnosis.

D: Lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis) is a form of tuberculosis that affects the skin, usually presenting as nodules or plaques with a characteristic apple jelly appearance. The histological features of lupus vulgaris are granulomatous inflammation, not autoantibody deposition.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Pemphigus vulgaris.
C
476
C: Eosinophilic sialodochitis

Explanation: The history of recurring submandibular gland swelling and pain, along with the presence of a cast at the opening of the Wharton duct, as well as the presence of numerous eosinophils in the histological slide, suggests a diagnosis of Eosinophilic sialodochitis. IgG4-related sialadenitis is characterized by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis, which are not present in this case. Kimura disease typically presents with painless subcutaneous nodules, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral eosinophilia, which are not present in this case. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is characterized by vascular proliferation with clusters of lymphoid follicles and eosinophils, which are not seen in this case.
C
477
I would choose option D: Bring the patient to the operating room urgently and remove and send the DSAEK graft for microbiological culture and sensitivity.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with an inflamed conjunctiva, epithelial defect, infiltrate, anterior chamber cells, hypopyon, and graft-host interface haze suggests a possible graft infection or rejection. In order to determine the cause, it is necessary to remove the DSAEK graft and send it for microbiological culture and sensitivity testing. This will help identify the causative organism and determine the appropriate treatment. It is important to act urgently to prevent further damage and preserve the patient's vision.

478
A: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotyping (eg, for HLA-A29)

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation of multifocal choroidal lesions, it is important to consider the possibility of serpiginous choroiditis, which is commonly associated with HLA-A29. HLA haplotyping, specifically for HLA-A29, can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Other options, such as empirical steroids or interferon-γ release assay, may be considered depending on the results of the HLA haplotyping. Observation alone may not be sufficient, as the cause of the lesions and decline in vision needs to be determined.

479
B: Order magnetic resonance imaging to investigate for masses

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset blurry vision, elevated intraocular pressure, and shallow anterior chambers in both eyes are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma. However, the absence of visible angle structures on gonioscopy raises concern for a secondary cause, such as a mass or tumor obstructing the drainage angle. Ordering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help identify any anatomical abnormalities or masses that may be causing the patient's symptoms. This will aid in making an accurate diagnosis and determining the appropriate treatment approach.
D

480
C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including proptosis, limitation of extraocular movements, and abnormal findings on fundus examination and fluorescein angiography, suggests a diagnosis of an orbital mass or increased intraocular pressure causing optic nerve compression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the structure of the eye and surrounding structures. Applanation tonometry would help assess intraocular pressure but would not provide information about the underlying cause. Serum thyroid testing is not indicated at this time, as there are no features suggestive of thyroid eye disease. Computed angiography of the head would primarily evaluate blood vessel abnormalities and is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

cellvalue empty
481
The correct answer is D: Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of ptosis, ocular motility restriction, and muscle weakness, along with the elevated acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels, suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The elevated creatine kinase, aldolase, and C-reactive protein levels indicate muscle inflammation, suggesting the presence of myositis. The negative results for acetylcholine receptor blocking and muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies rule out other potential causes. The absence of a thymoma on chest computed tomography also supports the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.
D
cellvalue empty
482
Answer: C: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer and the presence of placoid yellow choroidal lesions with subretinal fluid in both eyes, there is concern for metastasis to the eyes. In this case, obtaining an MRI of the head and orbits would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for any intracranial or orbital involvement. This will help determine the extent of the disease and guide further management. Injecting intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication without further evaluation may delay the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of potential metastasis. Stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab may be necessary if there is evidence of ocular metastasis, but further imaging is needed to confirm the suspicion.

483
Answer: C: The patient has both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, hair loss, irregular periods, and tingling sensation in the hands and feet are consistent with both iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency. The physical examination findings of bilateral flattening of the temporalis muscle and thenar eminence further suggest malnutrition, which can contribute to both deficiencies. Additionally, the patient's history of RYGB surgery and poor dietary intake, with a daily total calorie intake of less than 500 kcal and less than 20 g of protein, increases the likelihood of malabsorption and deficiency of both iron and vitamin B12. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the patient has both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies.

484
B: Invasive extramammary Paget disease

Explanation: The clinical presentation of well-defined, firm, indurated plaques on the vulva with nodules on the surface is consistent with invasive extramammary Paget disease. This condition typically affects older women and presents as erythematous plaques on the vulva or perianal area. Biopsy findings confirm the diagnosis. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma, vulvar Crohn disease, and cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from rectal carcinoma are less likely based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings.
D

485
The correct diagnosis is C: Shagreen patch.

Explanation: Shagreen patch is a characteristic feature of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organs. Shagreen patches are connective tissue nevi that typically appear on the lower back or buttocks. Other dermatologic findings in TSC include facial angiofibromas, which are dome-shaped papules that develop on the nose and cheeks. In this case, the patient presents with a firm plaque on the occipital scalp, along with multiple growing papules. Biopsy of the papules showed diffuse dense fibrosis, capillary vessel proliferation, and perifollicular fibroblastic proliferation, all consistent with angiofibroma. The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex, making option C the correct answer.
D

486
A: Anetoderma

Explanation: Based on the given clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is anetoderma. Anetoderma is a rare skin condition characterized by the presence of atrophic papules and plaques that may develop gradually over time. The lesions are typically skin-colored to hyperpigmented and exhibit the buttonhole sign on palpation. Histopathological examination shows a poorly circumscribed hypercellular proliferation of spindle cells in the lower reticular dermis with infiltration of subcutaneous fat. The spindle cells have elongated, wavy nuclei and pale cytoplasm. Mitotic figures and nuclear pleomorphism are uncommon. Neurofibroma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (atrophic variant), and medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma are less likely based on the clinical and histopathological findings provided.

Answer: C: Rippling muscle disease

Explanation: Rippling muscle disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle contractions (rippling) that occur spontaneously or following muscle percussion. It can be associated with psoriasis and hypothyroidism. The presence of undulating wavelike movements visible on the muscle surface of the abdomen and calves in this case aligns with the characteristic findings of rippling muscle disease. The normal laboratory test results, including creatine kinase and autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibodies, further support the diagnosis of rippling muscle disease. The other options (A: Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome, B: Morvan syndrome, D: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) have different clinical features and are less likely based on the information provided.
A

488
Answer: D: Percutaneous revascularization.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of refractory vasospastic angina, intensification of medical therapy has not provided adequate control of her symptoms and has resulted in a decline in her ejection fraction. Percutaneous revascularization, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), may be necessary to relieve the vasospasm and restore blood flow to the affected coronary arteries. This procedure involves the use of a stent to open up the narrowed or blocked arteries.

Reprogramming the ICD (Answer B) may be considered if there are issues with the device or if it is not functioning properly, but it is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the patient's vasospastic angina.

Surgical revascularization (Answer C) may be an option for patients with refractory vasospastic angina, but it is typically reserved for those who do not respond to medical therapy or PCI. Given the patient's young age and the fact that her symptoms have not been well-controlled with medical therapy, PCI would be a more conservative and less invasive approach.

Corticosteroid therapy (Answer A) may be considered in certain cases of refractory vasospastic angina, particularly if there is evidence of an autoimmune or inflammatory component. However, there is no mention of such factors in the case description, and it is not typically a first-line treatment for this condition.

Therefore, based on the information provided, percutaneous revascularization (Answer D) would be the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.

The correct diagnosis is C: Ecchordosis physaliphora.

Explanation: Ecchordosis physaliphora is a rare benign lesion originating from notochordal remnants. It typically presents as an incidental finding on imaging studies. On histopathology, it is characterized by sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, "soap bubble-like" cells with a myxoid background, as seen in the provided image. The lesion is usually found in the midline of the posterior fossa, including the clivus and sphenoid sinus. It is important to differentiate ecchordosis physaliphora from more aggressive lesions, such as chordoma or chondrosarcoma, which have distinct histopathological features and clinical significance. Lipoma is unlikely in this case as it would not typically involve the sphenoid sinus and show such characteristic histopathological findings.
B
490
The correct answer is D: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a unilateral nasal mass, epiphora, headache, facial pressure, and the presence of a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending into the nasal cavity, suggests a malignancy originating from the nasopharynx. The pathology analysis results of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma further support this diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a type of head and neck cancer that commonly presents with nonspecific symptoms and can invade surrounding structures, such as the nasal cavity, maxillary bone, and orbit. The histologic findings of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells with areas of squamous differentiation and keratinization are consistent with the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
C
491
The correct answer is: D: Pendred syndrome.

Explanation: Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and thyroid abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes for pendrin. Enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts, fistulous communication between the internal auditory canal and the basal turn of the cochlea, and a bulbous dilation of the internal auditory canal are characteristic findings on imaging studies in patients with Pendred syndrome. This patient's presentation of hearing loss, enlarged vestibular aqueducts, and genetic mutation of the POU3F4 gene are consistent with a diagnosis of Pendred syndrome.
B
492
A: Obtain thyroid function test results or obtain endocrine evaluation results

Explanation: The patient's presentation with polydipsia, polyuria, and diabetes insipidus, along with the thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, suggests a possible endocrine disorder. Thyroid function test results or further endocrine evaluation can help determine if there is an underlying hormonal imbalance contributing to the bilateral orbital masses.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation. 

Explanation: Considering the findings of a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye, along with gliosis, tractional epiretinal membrane, and disorganization of retinal layers seen on optical coherence tomography, it is important to further investigate the underlying cause of this pigmented macular lesion. Ordering an MRI of the brain can help evaluate if there is any central nervous system involvement or associated abnormalities. Additionally, a medical genetics evaluation may be necessary to assess for any genetic syndromes or underlying genetic factors contributing to the lesion.

I would choose option D: Immunosuppressive therapy. 

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient is likely experiencing Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, which is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by bilateral uveitis, neurologic findings, and auditory symptoms. In VKH syndrome, choroidal detachments, retinal detachments, and subretinal fluid can occur. The patient's negative infectious and inflammatory workup supports an autoimmune etiology.

The initial treatment of VKH syndrome involves high-dose systemic corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone. However, in this case, the patient showed worsening visual acuity and subretinal fluid despite the treatment. Therefore, the next step would be to initiate immunosuppressive therapy to control the inflammation and prevent further damage.

Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing (option A) may be considered in cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty or suspicion of malignancy, but in this case, the clinical presentation and imaging findings are indicative of VKH syndrome.

Surgery to create scleral windows (option B) or a scleral buckle (option C) is not warranted in this case as they are not the primary treatment options for VKH syndrome.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to initiate immunosuppressive therapy (option D) to control the inflammation and hopefully improve the patient's visual outcomes.

495
C: Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation

Explanation: The patient presents with visual acuity loss, retinal thickening, and disc neovascularization associated with diabetic retinopathy. The most appropriate treatment option in this case is a combination of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation. 

Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections help to reduce retinal swelling and neovascularization by blocking the effects of VEGF, a protein that promotes the growth of leaky blood vessels in the retina. Laser panretinal photocoagulation is used to treat peripheral retinal ischemia and reduces the stimulus for further neovascularization.

By combining these two treatment modalities, we can address both the macular swelling (retinal thickening) and the abnormal blood vessel growth (disc neovascularization) seen in this patient. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving visual outcomes and preventing further vision loss in diabetic retinopathy patients.

Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser (option D) is a more invasive surgical option that may be considered if there are extensive hemorrhages or tractional retinal detachments present. However, this treatment is usually reserved for more advanced stages of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and is not the initial treatment of choice in this case.

Option A (laser panretinal photocoagulation alone) may only address the neovascularization but not the macular edema, which requires anti-VEGF therapy.

Option B (intravitreal anti-VEGF injections alone) may improve the macular edema but would not adequately address the neovascularization.

Therefore, option C (intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation) is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

I would choose answer option D: Bilateral antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.

Explanation: Bilateral blurry vision occurring after a car crash may be indicative of traumatic macular edema. The presence of macular edema with cystoid abnormalities and altered foveal reflection on fundus examination suggests the involvement of the macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the presence of bilateral macular edema, with central subfield thickness measurements exceeding the normal range.

Antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is the treatment of choice for macular edema. VEGF plays a key role in the pathogenesis of macular edema, and intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents have been shown to effectively reduce macular edema and improve visual outcomes.

Therefore, given the findings of bilateral macular edema in this case, the next step would be to initiate bilateral antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy to address the macular edema and potential visual impairment.

The correct answer is A: Cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer.

Explanation: The presentation of an easily bleeding, violaceous cutaneous lesion with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules in an elderly patient raises suspicion for cutaneous metastasis. In this case, the patient had a history of a rapidly expanding, itchy, painful nodule that eventually evolved into the described lesion. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes, including ipsilateral axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes, further supports the diagnosis of metastatic disease.

The absence of other cutaneous lesions and unremarkable physical and laboratory findings helps to differentiate it from primary cutaneous lymphoma. Loxoscelism, caused by brown recluse spider bites, typically presents as necrotic skin lesions but lacks the systemic symptoms and lymph node involvement seen in this case. Merkel cell carcinoma is characterized by firm, rapidly growing nodules, often on sun-exposed areas, and is less likely to present as a large, violaceous lesion with central necrosis.

A skin punch biopsy (Figure C) can be useful to confirm the diagnosis, showing histologic features consistent with metastasis from small cell lung cancer. Overall, given the clinical presentation and findings, cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer is the most likely diagnosis.

A: Review the ECG for frequent atrial ectopic beats

Explanation: In this case, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations suggest the possibility of arrhythmias originating from the atria. One possible arrhythmia to consider is frequent atrial ectopic beats. To confirm this, it would be important to carefully analyze the ECG for premature atrial contractions (PACs) or atrial premature beats. These would appear as early, abnormal P waves that are different from the normal sinus rhythm. The presence of frequent atrial ectopic beats may indicate underlying atrial pathology or increased atrial irritability. Further evaluation and monitoring may be necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management of the ectopic beats.

The correct answer is B: Assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with bronchiectasis, as evidenced by the chronic cough, dyspnea, productive sputum, and imaging findings of bronchiectasis on CT scan. The severe obstruction on pulmonary function testing with a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio and reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide suggests coexisting emphysema. Given this combination of bronchiectasis and emphysema, it is important to evaluate for underlying causes.

One of the possible underlying causes of bronchiectasis and emphysema in a patient with a significant smoking history is α1-antitrypsin deficiency. α1-antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor that protects lung tissue from damage by neutrophil elastase, an enzyme involved in lung inflammation and tissue destruction. The most common genetic mutations associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency are the Z and S alleles. Patients with α1-antitrypsin deficiency may present with early-onset emphysema and/or liver disease.

Therefore, assessing serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype is the next appropriate step to evaluate for α1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of bronchiectasis and emphysema in this patient. Further confirmatory testing, such as liver function tests and/or liver biopsy, may be indicated if α1-antitrypsin deficiency is confirmed.

B: Large-plaque parapsoriasis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of hypopigmented and hyperpigmented reticulated patches and thin, atrophic plaques involving the axilla, groin, and flanks is consistent with large-plaque parapsoriasis. This condition typically occurs in middle-aged individuals and is characterized by long-standing, mildly pruritic patches and plaques that are usually limited to the trunk and proximal extremities. The absence of systemic symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings further supports this diagnosis. The histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis findings are not provided in the given information, but they can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of large-plaque parapsoriasis.

The correct answer is A: Linear morphea.

Explanation: Linear morphea is a form of localized scleroderma characterized by linear, atrophic, and sclerotic plaques. The rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extending from the tip of the patient's right shoulder to the right biceps is indicative of morphea. The arborizing purple plaque, along with the slightly indurated, irregular papules within it, further supports the diagnosis. The tingling sensation reported by the patient is also consistent with morphea. The negative findings on review of systems, except for easy bruising, and the lack of warmth, thrills, or pulsations across the affected area help differentiate morphea from other conditions. The patient's medication history and previous shoulder replacement surgery are not likely related to the development of morphea. The punch biopsy results showing a dermal infiltrate composed mostly of histiocytes further confirm the diagnosis.

The correct answer is B: Diffuse melanosis cutis.

Explanation:
Diffuse melanosis cutis refers to generalized or widespread hyperpigmentation of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes. The presence of dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration in this patient is consistent with this diagnosis. Diffuse melanosis cutis can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with metastatic melanoma, which is supported by the patient's history of malignant neoplasm with positive immunohistochemistry staining for S100, HMB-45, and MART-1. The worsening hepatic metastases and right axillary adenopathy on imaging studies further support the association with metastatic melanoma. This type of hyperpigmentation is not related to sun exposure or disorders such as hemochromatosis or Addison disease.

503
B: Subcutaneous ICD reprogramming and observation

Explanation: The patient experienced shocks from the subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) while sleeping, with no associated symptoms or signs of decompensated heart failure. This suggests inappropriate shocks from the device. Therefore, reprogramming the S-ICD is the next appropriate step, as it may help to reduce the occurrence of inappropriate shocks. observation should also be done to monitor the patient's response after reprogramming the S-ICD. The other options, such as administering anticoagulation, increasing the β-blocker dose, administering a loading dose of amiodarone, or referring the patient for catheter ablation, are not indicated in this scenario as there is no evidence of an arrhythmia or need for rhythm control intervention.

B: Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a gradually increasing exophytic dorsolateral tongue mass, along with severe stabbing pain and otalgia, is suggestive of a neoplastic process. The biopsy findings, including ulceration, abundant acute and chronic inflammation with eosinophils, and palisaded areas (Verocay bodies) in the spindled cell proliferation, are consistent with a schwannoma. The positive staining of the proliferating spindle-shaped cells with SOX-10 on immunohistochemistry further supports this diagnosis. The traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction seen on biopsy is likely a secondary inflammatory response to the mass. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction.
B
505
The answer option is A: Tuberculosis of the palate.

Explanation: The patient's clinical history is significant for HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. The presence of weight loss, low CD4 count, and necrotic lymph nodes on imaging suggest an opportunistic infection in the setting of immunosuppression. The clinical presentation of dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, and perforation of the hard palate is consistent with tuberculosis involvement of the palate. Tuberculosis can present with various manifestations, and in immunocompromised individuals, disseminated disease can occur. The palatine biopsy and the staining with Grocott methenamine silver can help to identify the presence of acid-fast bacilli, confirming the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
C
506
I would choose option B: Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser.

Explanation: The patient's sudden-onset blurry vision and the imaging findings suggest that there may be opacification or clouding of the posterior capsule, which is interfering with the patient's visual acuity. Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy is a safe and effective procedure to create an opening in the posterior capsule, allowing improved visual access to the retina. This procedure can be performed in the office and has a high success rate in improving visual acuity without the need for surgery. Given the stability of the posterior segment and the lack of other findings, performing posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser would be the next appropriate step in this case.
B

507
C: Initiate topical cyclosporine.

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is a rare corneal condition called Salzmann nodular degeneration. This condition typically presents with bilateral, gray-white, irregular corneal opacities, primarily involving the subepithelium and sometimes extending into the anterior stroma. There is usually no associated epithelial or deeper stromal involvement.

Topical cyclosporine, an immunomodulatory medication, can help in managing Salzmann nodular degeneration as it reduces inflammation and prevents further progression of the disease. Therefore, initiating topical cyclosporine would be the next appropriate step in the management of this patient. This can be continued long-term to control the condition and improve visual symptoms.

The other answer options are less appropriate in this case. Oral acyclovir sodium is used to treat viral infections and does not address the underlying cause of the corneal opacification. Performing a penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) is not necessary at this stage as the condition can be managed conservatively. Superficial corneal biopsy is not typically indicated in cases of Salzmann nodular degeneration as the clinical findings are often diagnostic.

The answer is B: Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).

Explanation: The patient presented with neurological symptoms, including falls, weakness, confusion, left eye pain, and slurred speech. The physical examination revealed expressive aphasia, left abducens nerve palsy, and decreased motor strength on the right side. Laboratory evaluation showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating an inflammatory process in the central nervous system. Imaging studies demonstrated multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, which are suggestive of lymphoproliferative disorder. Biopsy of the brain lesion showed positive immunohistochemical stain for CD20, confirming the presence of lymphoid cells. In an immunocompromised patient with a history of solid organ transplant, the most likely cause of these findings is primary central nervous system PTLD.

B: Test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies

Explanation: Given the patient's history of recurrent oral and penile lesions, along with the negative serology results for HSV, syphilis, and other sexually transmitted infections, it is important to consider other potential causes. The positive result for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM suggests a possible association with this atypical bacterial infection. However, the presence of oral and genital lesions raises concern for a possible autoimmune etiology, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Testing for anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies can help confirm or rule out SLE as the underlying cause. Further evaluation and treatment can then be guided accordingly.

Answer: D: Perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Horner syndrome, which is characterized by unilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. In this case, the patient's complaint of dilated pupil, anisocoria more pronounced in bright lighting conditions, poor pupillary reactivity to light, and absence of other neurologic findings suggest a sympathetic pathway disruption, most likely in the first-order neuron of the oculosympathetic pathway. Pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine can help confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. Apraclonidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that causes a greater reversal of ptosis and a smaller change in pupil diameter in the affected eye compared with the unaffected eye. If anisocoria is greater without pharmacologic testing and reverses (or lessens) with the use of apraclonidine, it confirms a diagnosis of Horner syndrome. CT angiography or MRI are not indicated at this time because the patient's presentation is consistent with Horner syndrome, and there are no signs or symptoms to suggest an underlying aneurysm or brainstem stroke. Reviewing medications may be useful in determining any potential causes or triggers of the patient's symptoms, but it is not the next step in management.

A: Perform additional pericardial effusion cytology and culture testing.

Explanation: The elevated ADA level in the pericardial fluid suggests a high likelihood of tuberculous pericarditis. However, other causes of pericardial effusion should also be considered. Performing additional tests such as cytology and culture can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. This will provide important information about the underlying cause of the effusion and may help to determine the need for continued antitubercular therapy or additional treatment options.

514
D: Perform an interventional radiology–guided biopsy of the mass.

Explanation:
Based on the given history and clinical findings, the presence of a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density on the abdominal CT scan is concerning for a potential malignancy. The next step in the management of this patient would be to perform a biopsy of the mass to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Performing an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass (option C) would be an aggressive approach without having a confirmed diagnosis. It is important to obtain tissue for pathological examination before considering surgery to determine the extent and nature of the mass.

Performing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (option A) would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings are not suggestive of pathology in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

Performing diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings (option B) may be considered as an option for further evaluation, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis of the mass.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an interventional radiology-guided biopsy of the mass (option D) to obtain tissue for pathological examination and determine the nature of the mass.

515
The correct answer is B: Reactive perforating collagenosis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient, with multiple pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core scattered throughout the trunk and extremities, is consistent with reactive perforating collagenosis. Reactive perforating collagenosis is a cutaneous disorder characterized by transepidermal elimination of altered collagen. It is commonly associated with underlying systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and hematological malignancies. In this case, the patient's history of relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia and immunosuppression due to chemotherapy likely predisposed her to developing reactive perforating collagenosis. The punched biopsy obtained from the left flank and subsequent histopathological analysis supports this diagnosis.

Disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination (A), disseminated cryptococcosis (C), and Malassezia (formerly Pityrosporum) folliculitis (D) are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and the absence of relevant risk factors or characteristic features on examination or histopathology.

Based on the information provided, the correct diagnosis is C: Malignant acanthosis nigricans.

Explanation: Malignant acanthosis nigricans is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. The clinical presentation of widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques with involvement of mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva, lips, and gingiva, is characteristic of malignant acanthosis nigricans.

The patient's weight loss, enlarged thyroid, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort are all consistent with systemic manifestations of an underlying malignancy. The significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 242 further support the presence of an underlying malignancy.

Biopsy specimens revealing a papillary structure with hyperkeratosis are also suggestive of malignant acanthosis nigricans.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is malignant acanthosis nigricans (Option C).
C

517
The correct answer is B: Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Explanation: The patient presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremities associated with pedal edema, which is consistent with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLV). The presence of palpable purpuralike lesions indicates small vessel vasculitis. The absence of constitutional symptoms, joint pains, blood in urine, periorbital edema, recent medication intake, and abnormal hepatic and renal function excludes other possible etiologies such as amyloidosis, cryoglobulinemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug-induced vasculitis. The chest radiograph and computed tomographic scan showing a mass in the upper lobe of the left lung and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as well as bilateral adrenal masses on abdominal ultrasound, suggest an underlying malignancy. CLV is commonly associated with malignancies, most frequently hematologic malignancies, solid organ tumors, and occasionally, carcinomas of the lung, as seen in this case. A skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis of CLV by showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis, and neutrophilic infiltration of blood vessel walls, as seen in the lesional skin biopsy specimen in this case.

C: Treat medically with aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin.

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset chest pain, radiating to the left arm, along with concomitant nausea, diaphoresis, elevated troponin levels, and ST-segment elevations on the electrocardiogram, the most likely diagnosis is an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient should be treated with medical therapy that includes aspirin, a β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin. These medications help reduce the risk of further cardiovascular events and improve long-term outcomes. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may also be considered depending on the severity and extent of coronary artery disease seen on the angiogram, but medical therapy should be initiated regardless.

I would choose option C: Treat medically with aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin.

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory test results, and electrocardiogram (ST-segment elevations), this is suggestive of an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient should be urgently transferred to the catheterization laboratory for coronary angiography. However, before revascularization, medical therapy should be initiated to help stabilize the patient and reduce further ischemic damage.

The recommended medical therapy for STEMI includes:

1. Aspirin: To inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce the risk of further clot formation.

2. β-blocker: To reduce heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand, thereby reducing infarct size and improving patient outcomes.

3. Clopidogrel: To inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce the risk of further clot formation. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has been shown to be more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of recurrent events in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

4. Statin: To lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events. Statins have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is necessary for the patient, but it is recommended to initiate medical therapy first to stabilize the patient's condition. Once the patient is stabilized, PCI can be performed, if appropriate, to restore blood flow in the affected coronary artery.

Answer: D

Explanation: Revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention and start medical therapy.

In this case, the patient is presenting with a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, along with nausea and diaphoresis, which are classic symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shows marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5, confirming the diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 

The next step in management would be urgent revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery. This is typically done by inserting a catheter into the artery and using techniques such as angioplasty and stent placement to open up any blocked or narrowed areas. 

Medical therapy should also be initiated concurrently. This includes aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin. Aspirin helps to reduce platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. β-blockers help to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and prevent arrhythmias. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that helps to prevent further clotting. Statins are used to control dyslipidemia and stabilize plaque. 

Therefore, the best course of action would be to revascularize with PCI and start medical therapy, option D.

The correct answer is: C: Oral metastasis

Explanation: The patient's history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma and recent treatment with carboplatin suggests a possibility of metastasis to the oral cavity. The persistent pain and gingival swelling, along with the radiolucency on the periapical radiograph, further support the diagnosis of oral metastasis. The biopsy findings showing infiltrative tumor cells positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1 are consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Other options such as pyogenic granuloma, gingival/periodontal abscess, or squamous cell carcinoma are less likely given the clinical presentation and patient history.
C
520
My diagnosis is: C: Type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) pharyngitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe sore throat, odynophagia, and ulcerative lesions with exudate and erythema extending throughout the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx is highly suggestive of HSV-2 pharyngitis. The negative results on the rapid Streptococcus test, recent HIV screen, and rapid plasma reagin test help to exclude other possible causes. The patient's history of pharyngeal gonorrhea is not likely to be related to his current symptoms, as gonorrhea typically presents with a purulent discharge and not ulcerative lesions. The patient's prophylactic emtricitabine-tenofovir use and history of diphtheria booster help rule out diphtheria as the cause of his symptoms. Mononucleosis typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, which the patient does not have. Therefore, HSV-2 pharyngitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.
C
521
The correct answer is D: Aspergillosis.

Explanation: The history of a kidney transplant and immunosuppression puts the patient at risk for opportunistic infections. The findings of diffuse white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis, supraglottis, posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus, along with limited glottic mobility and substantial airway obstruction, suggest the possibility of invasive fungal infection. The computed tomographic findings also support this, showing posterior tracheal wall thickening and loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, as well as moderate to severe obstruction in the left mainstem bronchus. The biopsy results would likely show invasive hyphae consistent with Aspergillus infection. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Aspergillosis in this immunocompromised patient.
D
522
Answer: D: Nasal cavity hamartoma

Explanation: The imaging findings and biopsy results are consistent with a nasal cavity hamartoma. Nasal cavity hamartomas are benign lesions that arise from disorganized tissue elements and may involve respiratory epithelium, seromucinous glands, and other components. They can present as incidental findings and are typically asymptomatic, as in this case. The imaging findings of polypoid-enhancing masses with avid post-contrast enhancement, cystic change, and heterogeneously hyperintense T2 signal, along with the widening and remodeling of the olfactory clefts, are consistent with a nasal cavity hamartoma. The biopsy findings of submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands further support this diagnosis. Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma is unlikely given the histological appearance of bland-appearing cells. Inflammatory nasal polyps typically present with rhinological symptoms, which the patient did not have. Inverted papilloma would show a more characteristic appearance on imaging and biopsy.
D
523
C: Order cranial magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a pituitary macroadenoma and prior treatment with surgery and radiation, it is important to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or recurrence that may be causing the intermittent diplopia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging modality to assess the pituitary region and surrounding structures. This will help determine if there is any compression or other pathology that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Carbamazepine is indicated for trigeminal neuralgia and not appropriate in this case. Bilateral lateral rectus recessions may be considered if there is evidence of a primary strabismus or muscle imbalance, but the presence of a large-angle exotropia only after sustained right gaze and limited adduction on attempted left gaze suggests a gaze-evoked condition rather than a primary strabismus. Obtaining anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies is more relevant in the evaluation of myasthenia gravis, which is not supported by the patient's clinical presentation.

B: Complete an excisional biopsy of the lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a painless, reddish mass in the conjunctiva that has been present since birth and the findings of a vascular, fluctuant, multifocal mass on slitlamp examination, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a tissue sample through excisional biopsy. This will help confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the lesion, as well as guide further management if necessary. Magnetic resonance imaging (option A) may be considered if the biopsy results are inconclusive or further investigation is needed. Needle drainage (option C) is not recommended as it may lead to recurrence and incomplete resolution of the lesion. Initiating systemic propranolol (option D) is not indicated in this case as the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion does not bother him cosmetically.

I would choose option B: Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy.

Explanation: Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy involves surgically implanting a radioactive plaque onto the surface of the eye near the tumor. The radiation emitted from the plaque helps to destroy the tumor cells and prevent further growth. This treatment option is particularly effective for choroidal masses and has been shown to have good outcomes with minimal side effects.

The next step would be to choose answer option D: Repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month. 

Explanation: The patient has a known diagnosis of glaucoma and is currently being treated with latanoprost. Repeating the visual fields and checking the intraocular pressure (IOP) in 1 month will help monitor the progression of the visual field loss and assess the effectiveness of the current treatment. This will also help determine if any adjustments need to be made to the treatment plan.

527
I would choose answer option D: Start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe. 

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness, along with the presence of crackles in the lungs and a soft S1 on cardiac examination, it is important to consider an infectious etiology. The presence of bilateral lung crackles suggests the possibility of a pulmonary infection, such as pneumonia. 

In this case, obtaining blood cultures is a necessary step to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. Starting broad-spectrum antibiotics will help provide coverage against a wide range of potential pathogens until the culture results are available. 

Other interventions, such as diuresis with furosemide, emergency surgery for aortic valve repair, or placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump, are not indicated based on the provided information. These interventions may be considered in specific scenarios, but in this case, focusing on initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy is the most appropriate next step.

The correct answer is B: Scleromyxedema.

Explanation: Scleromyxedema is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by the presence of waxy papules, diffuse skin infiltration, and mucin deposition in the dermis. It typically presents with cutaneous findings such as papules and plaques that coalesce into firm, skin-colored or pink lesions. The skin involvement often leads to contractures, as seen in this patient with decreased finger flexion and grip strength. The condition can also affect internal organs, leading to dysphagia and joint involvement, which may present as arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

The laboratory results in this patient are suggestive of monoclonal gammopathy, which is seen in some cases of scleromyxedema. This is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal spike on serum protein electrophoresis and IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy on immunofixation.

The punch biopsy findings showing fibroblastic proliferation and mucin deposition in the dermis further support the diagnosis of scleromyxedema.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) presents with similar skin findings, but dysphagia and joint involvement are not typically seen. Lepromatous leprosy primarily affects the peripheral nerves and skin, and is characterized by hypoesthesia and thickened skin lesions. Scleroderma primarily affects the skin and internal organs, but does not typically present with waxy papules.

The correct answer is D: Kyrle disease.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation of unilateral asymptomatic hyperkeratotic papules on the leg, along with the histopathological findings of compact hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, and bandlike lymphocyte infiltrate in the superficial dermis, is consistent with Kyrle disease.

Kyrle disease, also known as hyperkeratosis follicularis et parafollicularis in cutem penetrans, is a rare disorder characterized by hyperkeratotic papules and nodules that primarily affect the lower extremities. It most commonly occurs in individuals with diabetes mellitus or renal insufficiency. The lesions often start as follicular papules that evolve into hyperkeratotic plaques. The histopathology typically demonstrates epidermal hyperkeratosis, focal parakeratosis, and transepidermal elimination of keratin. Additionally, there is often a bandlike lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis.

Stucco keratoses are small, white or tan hyperkeratotic papules commonly found on the lower extremities of elderly individuals. They typically present with a "stuck-on" appearance, and the histology reveals compact hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis without significant inflammation.

Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, also known as Flegel disease, is a very rare disorder characterized by persistent small brown or red-brown papules, primarily on the lower extremities. Histopathology shows compact hyperkeratosis with orthokeratotic and parakeratotic layers.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis is a disorder characterized by numerous annular lesions with a hyperkeratotic border and atrophic center. It most commonly affects sun-exposed areas, such as the face, arms, and legs. Histology shows a cornoid lamella, which is a column of tightly compacted parakeratosis with a thin granular layer, overlying an atrophic epidermis.

In summary, the patient's clinical presentation and histopathology findings are consistent with Kyrle disease.

The correct answer is C: Faciobrachial dystonic seizures.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including involuntary contractions of the right face, arm, and leg, without warning, are consistent with faciobrachial dystonic seizures. These seizures typically last for a few seconds before muscle relaxation occurs. The lack of an epileptic abnormality on EEG and normal head MRI help rule out other possibilities. Myoclonus is a possibility, but it usually does not involve sustained contractions like in this case. Paroxysmal dyskinesia and tic disorder do not typically involve the face, arm, and leg in a synchronized manner like in this case.

C: Obtain laboratory workup for uveitis

Explanation: Given the patient's history and presenting symptoms of persistent redness and decreased vision in the right eye, as well as the presence of scattered intraretinal hemorrhages (IRHs) and cystoid macular edema (CME) on examination, it is important to consider uveitis as a potential cause. Obtaining a laboratory workup, including blood tests such as complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and autoimmune markers, can help determine if uveitis is the underlying cause. This will aid in guiding further management and treatment decisions. Intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent may be considered in the future if uveitis is confirmed as the cause. Systemic corticosteroids and cerebral angiography are not appropriate choices given the clinical presentation.

A: Computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation of progressive diplopia, ptosis, restricted abduction, enophthalmos, and superior sulcus hollowing, an orbital CT scan with contrast is warranted. This can help identify any anatomical abnormalities or masses in the orbit that may be causing the patient's symptoms. The scan will provide important information for further evaluation and management. Myasthenia gravis testing and thyroid function testing may also be considered, but imaging should be the next step in this case. Referral for strabismus surgery would not be appropriate at this point without first identifying the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

I would choose answer option C: Excisional biopsy.

Explanation: Given the history and clinical presentation of the patient, there is a suspicion of an unusual corneal mass. The pearly white appearance, elevation, vascularization, and absence of involvement of other adjacent structures raise concerns for a possible corneal neoplasm. An excisional biopsy would provide a tissue specimen for histopathological examination, which is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management planning. Local therapy with 5-fluorouracil may be an option in certain cases, but it is not the preferred initial approach in this scenario. Incisional biopsy may not provide enough tissue for a definitive diagnosis and is generally not recommended for corneal lesions. Observation may be considered in certain cases, but due to the patient's history and the characteristics of the mass, it is best to proceed with a biopsy for further evaluation.

The correct answer is A: Bleomycin toxic effects.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pruritus, linear hyperpigmented streaks and welts, and dark scratch marks are consistent with the dermatologic manifestations of bleomycin toxic effects. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent commonly used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma but can cause cutaneous toxicity in up to 25% of patients. The symptoms typically present within 2-3 weeks of starting treatment and are characterized by hyperpigmentation, atrophy, and sclerotic changes in the skin. The pruritus can be severe and not well-controlled with antihistamines and topical steroids. In this patient, the onset of symptoms aligns with the timing of her chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1), further supporting the diagnosis of bleomycin toxic effects.

Paraneoplastic skin diseases can occur in patients with malignancies but typically manifest as dermatoses that are distinct from the presentation described in this case.

Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is a pruritic skin condition that occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by a rash consisting of papules and plaques. However, the patient's rash began after delivery and was not present during pregnancy.

The correct answer is A: Kaposi sarcoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple erythematous indurated plaques and nodules confined to the left side of the chest and abdomen, along with axillary lymphadenopathy and upper limb edema, is highly suggestive of Kaposi sarcoma. Additionally, the patient's diagnosis of AIDS and low CD4 count further support this diagnosis, as Kaposi sarcoma is commonly associated with immunosuppression. Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy sample showing infiltration with lymphoid cells and positive immunohistochemical staining for c-Myc also supports the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma.

I would choose answer option D: Administer intravenous thiamine therapy.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and the history of alcohol abuse, this patient is most likely experiencing acute decompensated heart failure resulting from alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Thiamine deficiency is common in individuals with chronic alcohol abuse, and it can precipitate or worsen heart failure. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential cofactor in cellular energy metabolism, and its deficiency can impair myocardial function. Administering intravenous thiamine can help correct the deficiency and improve cardiac function.

The answer option is A: Simple ranula.

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation of a painless, slowly enlarging, midline neck mass that is soft, mobile, compressible, and displacing the tongue, along with the visible clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth, the most likely diagnosis is a ranula. A ranula is a cystic lesion that typically occurs in the floor of the mouth due to obstruction or rupture of a salivary gland duct, resulting in the accumulation of saliva. This condition is usually painless and can be managed with surgical removal. The other answer options (B: Epidermoid cyst, C: Vascular malformation, D: Odontogenic abscess) are less likely based on the given information.

Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is B: Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion.

Explanation:
The patient's history of chronic sinusitis and cocaine use, along with the physical examination findings of left facial pain, swelling, purulent nasal secretions, and necrotic bone in the nasal cavity, strongly suggest a cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion. This condition is characterized by destructive inflammation of the nasal septum, sinuses, and midface, usually resulting from the chronic use of cocaine. It can lead to persistent nasal congestion, recurrent epistaxis, facial pain, and eventual destruction of the nasal septum and surrounding structures. Treatment involves cessation of cocaine use and surgical intervention. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and chronic invasive fungal sinusitis may present with similar symptoms, but they are less likely given the patient's history and findings.

A: Inquire about rodent and other animal exposures

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of fever, rash, and migratory polyarthralgias, along with the findings of a purpuric and pustular rash and the gram stain of blood culture showing gram-negative rods (indicative of bacterial infection), it is important to gather more information about the patient's exposure to animals such as rodents. This is because rodents, particularly mice and rats, can carry certain bacterial pathogens such as leptospirosis and rat-bite fever, which can cause similar symptoms. Collecting this information will help guide further diagnostic and treatment options.

B: Core needle biopsy of the lesion

Explanation: In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a core needle biopsy of the lesion. This is because the patient's history and physical examination findings, along with the imaging results, are suggestive of a lipomatous tumor. A core needle biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the tumor's histology, such as whether it is an irregular lipomatous extremity tumor (also known as atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma) or a benign lipoma. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate management approach, which may involve complete excision for liposarcoma or observation for lipoma.

541
The correct answer is (D) Bullous pemphigoid.

Explanation: Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by tense bullae and vesicles on the skin. It is most commonly seen in older adults and is caused by the production of autoantibodies against proteins in the basement membrane zone. The lesions are typically pruritic and can occur on various parts of the body, including the face, neck, and hands. In this case, the patient's history of herpes zoster and the failure to respond to famciclovir suggest that the vesicles and bullae are not due to herpes reactivation, but rather an autoimmune reaction. This is further supported by the findings of erythematous plaques, tense blisters, and bullae, as well as the negative findings on the laboratory workup for other autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and pemphigus.
The answer is A: Cutaneous angiosarcoma. 

Explanation: The clinical presentation of violaceous swelling with telangiectasia and necrosis on the face, predominantly involving the left side, is consistent with the characteristic findings of cutaneous angiosarcoma. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that arises from endothelial cells of blood vessels and typically presents as a rapidly growing, infiltrative, and purplish lesion with ecchymosis-like appearance. It commonly occurs in older individuals and is often associated with chronic lymphedema, prior radiation therapy, or other vascular insults. In this case, the history of breast carcinoma, mastectomy, radiotherapy, and supraclavicular lymph node metastasis are notable risk factors for the development of cutaneous angiosarcoma.

Figure 2 shows a histopathological analysis, which is not provided in the case description. However, the clinical findings and the patient's history are highly suggestive of cutaneous angiosarcoma, making it the most likely diagnosis.

Radiation dermatitis (B) refers to the inflammation of the skin caused by radiation therapy and typically occurs within the radiation field. The presentation described in the case is not consistent with radiation dermatitis as it involves violaceous swelling, telangiectasia, and necrosis that are distinct features of cutaneous angiosarcoma.

Wolf isotopic response (C) refers to the occurrence of a different skin disease at the site of a previously healed condition. It is characterized by an unrelated dermatosis that appears in the same dermatome or anatomical area as the previous illness. While this phenomenon can occur, the clinical presentation and history provided in the case are more consistent with cutaneous angiosarcoma.

Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma (D) refers to the spread of breast carcinoma to the skin, resulting in telangiectasia and erythema. However, unlike cutaneous angiosarcoma, telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma typically presents as a solitary or few skin nodules rather than the diffuse involvement described in the case. Additionally, the presence of necrosis and the overall clinical picture are not suggestive of metastatic breast carcinoma.

The answer is B: Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.

Explanation: The patient's history of orthotopic liver transplant and subsequent development of plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD) suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder as the underlying cause of the skin eruption. The physical examination findings of violaceous nodules encircling the healed OLT incisional scar also support the diagnosis of pPTLD. The histopathological evaluation of the biopsy specimen shows an atypical infiltrate of lymphoid cells, further supporting the diagnosis.

A: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of acute-onset left hemibody weakness and dysarthria without changes in sensorium, lasting approximately 60 minutes each, is consistent with stroke-like episodes. The presence of pes planovalgus, tight achilles tendons, decreased vibratory and fine touch sensation, absent reflexes, and dorsiflexion weakness suggests a neurological disorder. The symmetric, bilateral, restricted diffusion and T2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter and corpus callosum seen on MRI are characteristic findings of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS syndrome). Additionally, the family history of neurological symptoms in the mother and brother further supports a genetic mitochondrial disorder.

D: Initiate intravenous penicillin therapy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with bilateral blurry vision, vitritis, and hyperfluorescent lesions on fluorescein angiography is consistent with ocular syphilis. The mildly reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test further supports this suspicion. Ocular syphilis is a manifestation of secondary syphilis, and prompt treatment with intravenous penicillin therapy is recommended for this condition. Therefore, initiating intravenous penicillin therapy would be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

C: Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral papilledema, visual loss, and empty sella syndrome suggests increased intracranial pressure. The next step should be to assess for possible venous sinus thrombosis with cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomographic venography (CTV). This will help identify any potential underlying pathology causing the elevated intracranial pressure.

B: Conjunctival biopsy

Explanation:
Given the presence of a conjunctival lesion in an elderly woman with progressive ptosis and visual symptoms, a conjunctival biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to further evaluate the lesion. A biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide management. This may help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, as well as determine the appropriate treatment approach. The other options listed, such as topical corticosteroid eyedrops, complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, and serum and urine electrophoresis, may be useful in certain cases but would not provide the same level of diagnostic information as a biopsy in this situation.

B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests

Explanation: Given the patient's nonhealing corneal ulcer and the presence of substantial underlying stromal loss, it is important to consider infectious causes, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. HSV is a common cause of corneal ulcers and can lead to severe complications if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Obtaining a tissue culture and antigen detection tests specifically for HSV will help confirm or exclude this infection. This information will be crucial in guiding appropriate treatment and management decisions.

B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a nonhealing corneal ulcer, it is important to consider infectious causes such as viral keratitis. Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of viral keratitis and can present with a nonhealing corneal ulcer. Obtaining herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests can help confirm or rule out a viral etiology for the corneal ulcer. This will guide appropriate treatment decisions as antiviral therapy may be necessary.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests

Explanation: Given the nonhealing nature of the corneal ulcer, the patient's history of trauma, and the lack of improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotics, it is important to consider infectious causes, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV keratitis can present with similar symptoms and signs, including a nonhealing corneal ulcer with surrounding epithelial heaping. Obtaining tissue culture and antigen detection tests for HSV will help to confirm or rule out this diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

C: Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation: The patient's history of irradiation to the brain and spine as a child and for a meningioma in adulthood puts him at risk for secondary malignancies, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC is the most common radiation-induced malignancy and can develop within the irradiated field, as seen in this patient. The pink and brown papules and plaques with ulceration are consistent with the clinical presentation of SCC. Additionally, the family history of similar cutaneous lesions in relatives suggests a genetic predisposition to radiation-induced SCC. Although angiosarcoma can also develop secondary to radiation therapy, it typically presents as red or purple plaques and nodules, which is not consistent with the clinical findings. Leukemia cutis and basal cell carcinoma would not typically present in this manner in an irradiated field.

551
B: Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis.

Explanation: The patient presented with progressive painful reddening and swelling of the left thigh after 11 cycles of nivolumab therapy. Clinical examination revealed diffuse erythematous induration of the upper thigh expanding to the lower left abdominal area, as well as multiple small palpable subcutaneous nonindurated nodules on the ipsilateral gluteal region and leg. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) detected multiple FDG-active lesions in both lower extremities and the lumbar region.

A diagnostic biopsy of the left thigh revealed a lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with no signs of vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescence and blood analysis showed an absence of specific autoimmune antigens. This constellation of findings suggests that the extensive soft-tissue activity is due to nivolumab-induced panniculitis.
B

552
B: Start intravenous heparin.

Explanation: The patient has presented with acute shortness of breath, elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral rales in the lungs, and reduced intensity of the mitral valve closure sound. These findings, along with the presence of a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve, suggest acute valve stenosis due to thrombus formation. In this situation, initiating anticoagulation with intravenous heparin would be appropriate to prevent further thrombus formation and embolization. Referring the patient for aortic root dissection repair may be necessary, but it is not the initial step in the management of acute valve stenosis caused by thrombus formation. Administering a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activator or performing percutaneous clot removal may increase the risk of bleeding complications and are not recommended as the first-line treatment in this scenario.
B

553
The correct diagnosis is A: Pott puffy tumor. 

Explanation: Pott puffy tumor is a rare condition characterized by a combination of a subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone and underlying osteomyelitis. It typically presents as a tender, fluctuant mass overlying the frontal bone, often associated with fever and headache. In this case, the patient presented with a nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid and resulted in total vision obstruction. The CT scan confirmed the bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus and displacement of the right globe inferiorly. The presence of air within the mass is characteristic of an abscess. Histopathological investigation revealed neoplastic epithelioid cells, which is not consistent with the diagnosis of Pott puffy tumor. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is Pott puffy tumor.
D
554
B: Tuberculosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo, along with other symptoms such as asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency, suggests a systemic infection as the underlying cause. Tuberculosis can affect multiple organs, including the central nervous system, and can cause hearing loss and vertigo. The presence of a mass in the lateral wall of the prostate gland further supports the possibility of tuberculosis, as genitourinary tuberculosis is a common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Biopsies of the prostate and brain lesions, along with additional diagnostic tests, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
D
555
My diagnosis is B: Lupus vulgaris.

Explanation: The presence of erythematous plaques with areas of scarring, along with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, is highly suggestive of lupus vulgaris. Lupus vulgaris is a chronic form of cutaneous tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Histopathological examination reveals granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis, as seen in the skin biopsy in this case. The presence of acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain confirms the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The lesions typically heal with atrophic scarring after appropriate anti-tubercular treatment.
B
556
B: Obtain additional imaging with computed tomography (CT)

Explanation: The patient's presentation of fever, headache, neck stiffness, and positive Kernig sign raises suspicion for meningitis. The initial workup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not show any abnormalities, but this does not rule out meningitis. Additional imaging with CT can help identify any intracranial abnormalities or sources of infection that may be causing the patient's symptoms. This can include identifying abscesses, subdural empyemas, or ventriculitis. CT is a useful tool in the evaluation of patients with suspected meningitis, and it should be performed in this case to further investigate the cause of the patient's symptoms. Continued intravenous antibiotics are important, but obtaining additional imaging can help guide the management further. Starting gabapentin or high-dose ibuprofen are not indicated in this case, as the patient's main concern is fever, neck stiffness, and headache. These symptoms require further evaluation before symptomatic management can be initiated.
B

557
Answer: D

Explanation: Given the symptoms and the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a possible diagnosis. However, the normal results of the temporal artery biopsy suggest that GCA may not be the cause of the symptoms. In order to further investigate possible causes of the symptoms and the elevated ESR, a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) should be done. This test can help identify any abnormalities in the levels of proteins, which may indicate underlying conditions such as infection, inflammation, or malignancy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be indicated if there were neurological symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Empirical methotrexate prescription is not appropriate as there is no evidence to support the diagnosis of GCA. Empirical sumatriptan prescription is not appropriate as it is used specifically for the treatment of migraines, and there is no mention of migraine symptoms in the case.
The correct answer is A: Granulomatous cheilitis.

Explanation: Granulomatous cheilitis, also known as Miescher cheilitis, is a rare inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the lips. It presents as chronic lip swelling with papules and nodules, often symmetrical, and can extend onto the vermilion border. There are no intraoral lesions, and systemic symptoms are usually absent. Biopsy findings typically show non-caseating granulomas. Treatment may involve topical or systemic corticosteroids.

The answer is C: Erdheim-Chester disease.

Explanation: 
Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, characterized by the infiltration of histiocytes into multiple organs, causing fibrosis and sclerotic changes. It typically presents in middle-aged adults with bone pain, constitutional symptoms, and organ dysfunction. In this case, the patient had extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space, sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures, and ureteral obstruction with chronic kidney disease. The biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque (xanthelasma) confirmed the presence of foamy histiocytes, which is consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. The CD68 immunohistochemical stain was diffusely positive in the histiocytic infiltrate. The confirmation of the diagnosis with a molecular test further supports the Erdheim-Chester disease diagnosis.

The correct answer is C: Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis.

Explanation: Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is a rare, chronic inflammatory dermatosis characterized by pruritic, annular plaques with pustules primarily distributed on the face and scalp. It can also involve the upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, as seen in this case. EPF typically presents with papules and pustules that coalesce to form plaques, which may have central clearing or follicular accentuation. The histological examination of the punch biopsies revealed a dense infiltrate of eosinophils within the follicular structures, confirming the diagnosis of EPF. Treatment options for EPF include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and phototherapy.

561
D: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient, including episodic migraine with visual aura, transient neurological symptoms, hearing loss, and segmental retinal arterial plaques, is suggestive of CADASIL. This is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, leading to the deposition of granular osmiophilic material in small arteries, including those in the brain, retina, and inner ear. The MRI findings of multiple white-matter lesions, some with enhancement, support the diagnosis. The negative infectious, rheumatologic, and hypercoaguable test results help to rule out other potential causes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is less likely due to the absence of characteristic MS lesions on MRI and the lack of oligoclonal bands in the CSF. Behçet disease typically presents with oral and genital ulcers, which the patient denies having. Susac syndrome involves branch retinal artery occlusions and cochlear hearing impairments, which are not seen in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is CADASIL.
C

562
I would choose option D: Start a course of oral corticosteroids. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of visual disturbances and photopsia, along with pain and discomfort during eye movements, are suggestive of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is commonly associated with demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Oral corticosteroids are the recommended initial treatment for optic neuritis to reduce inflammation and promote recovery of vision. Further investigations, such as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, may be needed to evaluate the underlying cause, but starting corticosteroids is the appropriate first step in management. Fluorescein angiography may not be necessary in this case as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with optic neuritis. Observation alone may not be sufficient for managing a potentially serious condition such as optic neuritis.

D: Draw a complete blood cell count with differential to evaluate for leukemic retinopathy or blood dyscrasia.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae, as well as the ocular findings of retinal hemorrhages and Roth spots, the most concerning potential underlying cause is hematologic in nature. Drawing a complete blood cell count with differential will help evaluate for conditions such as leukemia or other blood dyscrasias that could be responsible for the patient's retinal hemorrhages. This should be done before proceeding with other diagnostic tests or treatments.

564
B: Biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion

Explanation: Considering the presence of a pigmented conjunctival lesion with extension into the cornea, a biopsy is necessary to accurately diagnose the nature of the lesion. The differential diagnosis includes primary acquired melanosis with atypia or ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Biopsy will provide histopathological examination, allowing for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management plan.
B
cellvalue empty
565
I would choose option D: Order chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test. 

Explanation: The patient's persistent follicular conjunctivitis, the history of an upper respiratory tract illness 4 weeks prior, and the positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG suggest a potential systemic cause for the conjunctival findings. These findings, along with the possibility of granulomatous disease, warrant further investigation with a chest radiograph and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) serum level test. This is important to evaluate for possible sarcoidosis, as ocular involvement can occur in up to 60% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis.
C
cellvalue empty
566
C: Measure oxalate levels in blood and urine

Explanation: Monocular crystalline maculopathy is a rare condition characterized by the presence of refractile crystals in the macula. It is typically associated with elevated levels of oxalates in the blood and/or urine. Oxalate crystals can deposit in various tissues, including the retina, leading to visual disturbances.

In this case, the presence of refractile crystals in the posterior pole suggests the possibility of oxalate deposition. To confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause, it would be appropriate to measure oxalate levels in the blood and urine. This can help identify any abnormal metabolism or excretion of oxalate, which could be contributing to the condition.

Genetic workup may be considered if there is suspicion of a hereditary oxalate disorder, but it would be premature to request it without first confirming the presence of elevated oxalate levels.

Examining the retinal periphery may be useful to assess for any peripheral retinal abnormalities, but it is less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis in this case.

Although drug abuse can cause visual disturbances, there is no specific indication or findings in this case to support screening for intravenous abuse of opioids or other substances as the next step.

567
Answer: D: All of the above.

Explanation: Based on the symptoms and examination findings, this patient is presenting with optic nerve head edema, which is indicative of increased intracranial pressure. The high blood pressure on presentation suggests possible hypertensive emergency, and therefore controlling systemic blood pressure is warranted. Additionally, further workup is needed to determine the underlying cause of the hypertension and the optic nerve head edema. This can include blood tests for neuroretinitis (such as complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein) to rule out infection, inflammation, or autoimmune conditions. However, neuroretinitis alone would not explain the severe optic nerve head swelling and extensive retinal findings, so further imaging is needed. Performing magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venogram of the brain and orbits will help evaluate for any intracranial abnormalities or venous obstruction that could be causing the increased intracranial pressure and optic nerve edema. Additionally, a lumbar puncture will help assess cerebrospinal fluid pressure and rule out infectious or inflammatory causes. Therefore, all of the above options are necessary for a comprehensive evaluation and management of this patient.

568
My diagnosis is D: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Explanation: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the skin. The erythematous macular eruption, generalized itch, and lymphocyte morphology observed in the patient are consistent with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The absence of epidermal involvement and cellular atypia, as well as the negative findings on skin biopsy for leukocytoclastic vasculitis, fungal organisms, and dermal mucin, support this diagnosis.

Treatment with topical emollient, steroid creams, and oral antihistamines is commonly used to manage the symptoms of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. However, in this case, the patient did not show a satisfactory response to this treatment, and the hemoglobin level remained high with an increasing lymphocyte count. This may indicate a more significant underlying condition or a different diagnosis.

569
Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be:

B: High-dose immunosuppressant therapy

Explanation: The patient's high serum concentration of IgG4 suggests the possibility of IgG4-related coronary arteritis, which is an immune-mediated condition. The perivascular soft-tissue mass and aneurysms seen on the imaging are consistent with this diagnosis. High-dose immunosuppressant therapy, such as glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents, would be the most appropriate treatment for this condition. Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be considered if there is evidence of significant coronary artery occlusion or stenosis. However, in this case, the primary concern is the underlying immune-mediated pathology, which can be addressed with immunosuppressant therapy.

570
The diagnosis for this case is A: Squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of an enlarging tongue mass, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and the imaging findings of a rim-enhancing, centrally hypodense lesion on contrast-enhanced CT raise suspicion for malignancy. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the oral cavity, and it often presents as an ulcerative or exophytic mass. The lack of involvement of the surrounding structures and absence of cervical lymphadenopathy by size criteria on CT argue against advanced disease. The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma can be confirmed with a histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen.
D
571
The correct answer is B: Gigantiform cementoma.

Explanation:
Based on the history, imaging findings, and histologic findings, the diagnosis in this case is gigantiform cementoma. Gigantiform cementoma is a rare, benign fibro-osseous lesion that typically affects the jaws. It is characterized by expansile, sclerotic masses with calcifications within the bone. Histologically, it is characterized by a proliferation of fibrous connective tissue and cemento-osseous material.

Albers-Schönberg disease (A), also known as osteopetrosis, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density and susceptibility to fractures. It is not associated with the clinical or radiologic findings described in the case.

Fibrous dysplasia (C) is a benign bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. It typically affects multiple bones and can present with pain, fractures, and deformities. The radiologic appearance of fibrous dysplasia differs from the findings in this case.

Polyostotic ossifying fibroma (D) is a rare benign tumor that arises from fibroblasts. It typically presents as a unilateral lesion in the craniofacial bones and can cause expansion and deformities. However, the imaging findings and histologic features in this case are not consistent with polyostotic ossifying fibroma.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B: Gigantiform cementoma.
B
572
The answer is C: Multifocal canalicular adenoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of submucosal masses in the upper lip, lack of associated symptoms, and imaging findings of hyperenhancing nodules are characteristic of a multifocal canalicular adenoma. This is a benign tumor of the salivary gland ducts. Other options, such as basal cell adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma, tend to present differently and have distinct imaging features. It is important to consider the patient's history of smoking and drinking as potential risk factors. Further evaluation and histopathological examination are necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis.
C
573
A: Biopsy the lesions.

Explanation: Biopsy is the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of a specific skin condition, and a biopsy will help confirm the diagnosis. It will provide histopathological information and allow for appropriate treatment planning.

574
Answer: C: Highly selective mesenteric angiography

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tenderness, guarding, and the finding of mesenteric vascular compromise on the CT scan, highly selective mesenteric angiography would be the next step. This procedure can help identify the specific vascular abnormality causing the ischemia and guide further management decisions. It is important to assess the blood supply to the intestines and determine if there is a need for revascularization or surgical intervention, which can be done through angiography. Additionally, the patient's hematemesis after the CT scan suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, further supporting the need for angiography to identify and potentially treat any active bleeding source.
B
cellvalue empty
575
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract (Option C).

Explanation:
The patient's history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery raises the suspicion of potential malabsorption of nutrients, including iron, vitamin B12, and folate, which can lead to pancytopenia. Gastrointestinal bleeding or an underlying gastrointestinal malignancy could also be causing the pancytopenia.

While checking trace element levels (Option A) can be helpful in evaluating for nutritional deficiencies, it is more important to directly assess the gastrointestinal tract through endoscopy to identify the potential cause of pancytopenia.

Obtaining periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and supportive transfusions (Option B) can manage the symptoms of pancytopenia, but it doesn't address the underlying cause.

Starting an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (Option D) would not be appropriate at this stage as the cause of the pancytopenia is still unclear.

Performing an endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract will provide valuable information to guide further management.
Based on the description and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is A: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

Explanation: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by linear deposits of IgA along the basement membrane zone. It commonly presents as recurrent, annular bullae with central pallor and crusts, similar to the lesions described in the case. The histopathologic findings of confluent necrosis of the upper epidermal layers, subepidermal blistering, and inflammatory infiltrate are consistent with linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta, which is self-inflicted skin injury due to exposure to extreme cold, is unlikely in this case as the patient denies self-infliction and there is no evidence of freezing injury.

Herpes virus infection would typically present with vesicles, not bullae, and would have a different histopathologic appearance.

Bullous pemphigoid is another autoimmune blistering disorder, but it is characterized by subepidermal blisters and eosinophilic infiltrate, which is different from the findings described in the case.

577
The correct answer is D: Lichen planus pigmentosus.

Explanation:

Lichen planus pigmentosus is a rare variant of lichen planus characterized by the development of hyperpigmented patches with a reticulate pattern. It typically affects the face, neck, axillae, and intermammary areas, as seen in the case presented. The lesions may be accompanied by mild erythema and resolving papules at the periphery.

Histopathologic analysis of a lesional specimen from the patient revealed mild epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, foci of spongiosis, and enhanced basal layer pigmentation. There was also evidence of lichenoid and perivascular lymphomononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltrate, basal cell vacuolization, and melanin incontinence. These findings are consistent with lichen planus pigmentosus.

Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (choice A) is characterized by brownish hyperkeratotic papules that coalesce into plaques with a reticulate pattern. Prurigo pigmentosa (choice B) presents as a pruritic eruption of erythematous papules that later evolve into reticulated hyperpigmentation. Dowling-Degos disease (choice C) is a genodermatosis that manifests as hyperpigmented macules and reticulate pigmentation in flexural areas. None of these conditions fully correspond to the clinical and histopathologic findings presented.
A

578
B: Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis

Explanation: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to dysfunction of chloride channels. While CF primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, it can also manifest with various extra-pulmonary manifestations, including musculoskeletal symptoms.

The patient in this case is presenting with a relapsing-remitting, evanescent cutaneous eruption associated with joint pain. These symptoms are consistent with cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis, which is a known complication of CF. The joint pain primarily affects the wrist, knee, and ankle joints bilaterally, and the cutaneous symptoms include oval-shaped macules, urticarial-appearing papules, and petechial macules.

Other potential diagnoses can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and negative laboratory findings. Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis typically presents with fever, rash, and systemic symptoms, which are not seen in this case. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy typically presents with clubbing of the digits, which is not mentioned in the case. Serum sickness-like reaction is unlikely, as the patient does not have a history of recent medication use, and the symptoms are not consistent with an allergic reaction.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis, which can occur independently of pulmonary CF exacerbations or antibiotic use, and has a characteristic pattern of joint pain and cutaneous symptoms.

579
The diagnosis is C: Diabetic striatopathy.

Explanation:
Given that the patient has a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes with complications of neuropathy and retinopathy, the persistent chorea in the left upper extremity can be attributed to diabetic striatopathy. Diabetic striatopathy is a rare neurological complication of diabetes characterized by choreiform or ballismic movements, typically involving one side of the body. The MRI findings of T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and lentiform nucleus without restricted diffusion support this diagnosis.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and test results. Postinfectious/autoimmune chorea would typically be associated with a recent infection, which the patient denied having. Paraneoplastic chorea would require positive cancer screening results, which were negative in this case. Acute stroke would typically present with acute onset of focal neurological deficits, which was not seen in this patient.

Based on the given information, it would be appropriate to choose option B: Perform scleral biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms have not improved after 9 months of anti-inflammatory therapy, including high-dose oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, as well as topical corticosteroids. This suggests that there may be an underlying cause for the chronic eye redness and pain. Considering the patient's history of hypereosinophilic syndrome and recent hospitalization for pneumonia and myocarditis, it is important to investigate for any potential systemic causes of ocular inflammation.

Performing a scleral biopsy would help to determine if there is any underlying inflammatory or infectious process affecting the sclera. This can guide further management and treatment options for the patient.

A: Optical coherence tomography angiography.

Explanation: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed imaging of the retinal vasculature. In this case, the patient presents with a central scotoma and blurry vision, which could be indicative of a vascular issue. SD-OCT shows segmental atrophy of the inner retina, suggesting a possible vascular etiology. To further evaluate the retinal vasculature and confirm a vascular cause, OCT-A would be the next appropriate step.

I would choose option B: Recheck IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap.

Explanation: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of LASIK-associated interface fluid syndrome (IFS). IFS is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the interface between the LASIK flap and the stromal bed, leading to corneal edema and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Rechecking the IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap would provide a more accurate measurement of the actual IOP. This is important because the edema and potential distortion caused by the flap can affect the accuracy of IOP measurements with applanation tonometry. Rechecking the IOP will help determine if the elevated IOP has resolved or if further intervention is needed.

I would recommend choosing option D: Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy. 

Explanation: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can help determine the nature of the mass, whether it is benign or malignant. It can provide valuable diagnostic information before proceeding with any treatment. In this case, given the suspicion of retinoblastoma, a biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management decisions.

B: Obtain additional imaging

Explanation: The patient presents with progressive proptosis and worsening vision, along with a firm, nontender mass in the right superotemporal orbit. It is important to further evaluate the nature and extent of the mass before deciding on the appropriate biopsy procedure. Obtaining additional imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or orbital ultrasound, can provide more information about the characteristics of the mass and help guide further management.

A: Check myasthenia laboratory findings and commence pyridostigmine trial.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of ptosis and diplopia are suggestive of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects neuromuscular transmission. The initial step would be to check for myasthenia laboratory findings, such as acetylcholine receptor antibodies or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies. If the results are positive, a trial of pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, can be initiated as a first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis.

The answer is B: Impingement of the left sympathetic trunk.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of constant, bothersome sweating of the left forehead are consistent with hemifacial hyperhidrosis, which is excessive sweating on one side of the face. This is typically attributed to dysfunction or irritation of the sympathetic nervous system. Given the patient's history of a large left upper lobe lung mass abutting the anterior chest wall pleura, impingement of the left sympathetic trunk by the tumor could explain the symptoms. The image (Figure 1) shows that the tumor is in close proximity to the area of sympathetic nerve compression or invasion, indicated by the asterisk. This impingement of the sympathetic trunk can result in excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) on the affected side of the face.

587
B: Electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation

Explanation: The patient's presentation with wide complex tachycardia, syncope, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia suggests an arrhythmogenic substrate that may benefit from further evaluation with an electrophysiology study. This study can help identify the mechanism and origin of the tachycardia and guide the potential need for catheter ablation. Additionally, given the patient's history of hypertension and the absence of structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging, an arrhythmia-driven etiology is more likely in this case. Therefore, the next step should be an electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation.

588
The correct answer is D: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Explanation: The patient presented with a large tonsillar mass and symptoms such as voice changes, globus sensation, dysphagia, weight loss, and decreased appetite. Examination revealed a partially obstructing mass in the right oropharynx and a small, normal contralateral tonsil. The excised specimen was continuous with the right tonsil, suggesting origination from that site.

Given the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in the tonsils and commonly presents with symptoms such as enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, night sweats, and decreased appetite. Histopathological examination of the excised mass would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
C
589
C: Neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis.

Explanation: Neuroborreliosis refers to nervous system involvement in Lyme disease which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Cranial polyneuropathy is a recognized manifestation of neuroborreliosis, usually affecting the facial nerve (Bell palsy) but other cranial nerves may also be involved. The patient in this case had a history of flu-like illness followed by facial nerve paralysis, consistent with neuroborreliosis. The abnormal enhancement of the right facial nerve seen on the MRI further supports this diagnosis.

The appropriate answer is A: Macrocystic lymphatic malformation.

Explanation: The given information describes a newborn with a sublingual mass that is causing symptoms such as labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements. Based on the physical examination findings, imaging results, and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a macrocystic lymphatic malformation (also known as a lymphangioma). Macrocystic lymphatic malformations are benign, cystic lesions that arise from the abnormal development of lymphatic vessels. They can occur anywhere in the body, including the oral cavity. The typical imaging findings include a multiloculated cystic lesion that is bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging. The lack of fat within the lesion, absence of enhancement with gadolinium, and displacement of adjacent structures, such as the tongue in this case, further support the diagnosis of a lymphatic malformation. Treatment options for lymphatic malformations depend on the extent and symptoms associated with the lesion and may include surgical excision, sclerotherapy, or observation.

A: Additional genetic testing

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation, family history, and the presence of one CF-causing mutation, it is warranted to perform additional genetic testing to identify any other CF-causing mutations that may be present. This can help confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and guide further management and treatment decisions.

The answer is B: Recommend removal of tattoos.

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms, the inflammation and blurry vision coinciding with the skin inflammation around the tattoos, and the histopathological findings of macrophages containing black granular pigment, it is likely that the tattoo pigment is causing an inflammatory reaction within the eye (uveitis). Therefore, the best course of action is to remove the tattoos, as this will remove the source of inflammation and potentially improve the patient's vision and symptoms. Initiation of topical steroid eyedrop therapy may be considered to manage the inflammation in the meantime, but it would not address the underlying cause. Referring immediately to rheumatology or performing surgical implantation of a glaucoma drainage device are not indicated based on the information provided.

C: Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites

Explanation: The presence of multiple disseminated, pin-sized papulopustulovesicles with serpiginous or J-shaped burrows strongly suggests scabies infestation. In this case, because the baby had contact with a person who had pruritus and reports suggest that the babysitter was infested with scabies, scabies is the most likely diagnosis. Skin scraping from multiple sites can confirm the diagnosis by identifying the mite or its eggs or feces. Treatment with a topical agent, such as permethrin, would be appropriate if the diagnosis is confirmed. Intravenous antibiotics and topical steroids are not appropriate for this presentation. Doing nothing and reassuring the parents would not address the underlying condition.

The answer is C: Pyoderma vegetans.

Explanation: Pyoderma vegetans is a rare inflammatory disorder that typically presents with pustules that develop into vegetating and ulcerated plaques. It is often associated with underlying systemic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune disorders. The histopathologic findings of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and dermal neutrophilia seen in the biopsy specimen are consistent with the diagnosis of pyoderma vegetans. Treatment typically involves systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.

The correct answer is A: Primary anetoderma.

Explanation: Primary anetoderma is a rare benign disorder characterized by well-demarcated, atrophic, round lesions on the skin. These lesions typically have a scar-like appearance. The lesions are usually symmetric and bilateral, often affecting the malar and preauricular areas. The skin lesions are not indurated and do not display epidermal changes. Patients with primary anetoderma usually do not have a history of previous inflammation. The condition can be diagnosed by performing a punch biopsy, which can show focal loss of elastic fibers in the mid-dermis.

Atrophoderma vermiculata, Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis, and Facial morphea are alternative diagnoses that do not fit with the clinical presentation described in the case. Atrophoderma vermiculata is a genetic disorder characterized by reticulated hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules that do not have a scar-like appearance. Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis is a type of acne scarring that is not typically bilateral and symmetrical. Facial morphea is a subtype of localized scleroderma that presents with thickened and indurated plaques, which is inconsistent with the non-indurated lesions described in the case.

596
D: Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.

Explanation: The presentation of a shiny, tense, erythematous papule on the glans penis in a patient with a history of multiple myeloma suggests the possibility of primary nodular amyloidosis. This condition is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in various tissues and organs, including the penis. The histopathological evaluation of the biopsy will confirm the diagnosis by showing the presence of amyloid deposits. The other options listed, including primary penile B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma of the penis, and plasmacytoma, are less likely given the specific clinical presentation and history of the patient.

597
Based on the information provided, the correct answer is C: Amyand hernia (appendix included within the inguinal hernia sac).

Explanation: 
The patient presents with a palpable and partially reducible right groin mass, which is characteristic of a hernia. The presence of leukocytosis, leukocyturia with positive cultures for Streptococcus viridians, and a history of cirrhosis suggests that the patient may have an infected hernia. The computed tomography scans show an appendix within the inguinal hernia sac, which is consistent with an Amyand hernia.

An Amyand hernia is a rare type of inguinal hernia where the appendix is included within the hernia sac. It can lead to complications such as appendicitis, abscess formation, or perforation. In this case, the patient's symptoms of right groin pain and difficulty voiding may be explained by the presence of an infected Amyand hernia.

Other answer options:
- A: Sliding hernia: Sliding hernia involves the protrusion of an organ (such as the bladder or colon) within the hernia sac, which does not match the findings in this case.
- B: Saphena varix: Saphena varix refers to the dilation of the saphenous vein, which is unrelated to the patient's symptoms and findings.
- D: Communicating hydrocele: Communicating hydrocele is a condition where there is communication between the peritoneal cavity and the scrotum, resulting in fluid accumulation. This does not explain the palpable mass or the findings on computed tomography scans.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis based on the information provided is C: Amyand hernia (appendix included within the inguinal hernia sac).

The most likely diagnosis in this case is C: Ileo-colic intussusception. 

Explanation: Ileo-colic intussusception refers to the telescoping of one segment of the intestine (the intussusceptum) into another segment (the intussuscipiens), usually occurring at the ileo-colic junction. This condition is more commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults, especially during pregnancy. 

In this case, the patient presented with acute abdominal pain and vomiting, which are typical symptoms of intussusception. The pain was located in the periumbilical region and intensified over a few hours, which is also consistent with intussusception. The presence of normal fetal movements suggests that the fetus was not affected by the condition.

Initial surgical evaluation ruled out a surgical cause for the abdominal pain, but the persistence of symptoms and an elevated leukocyte blood count raised suspicion for a surgical condition, leading to a second surgical consultation. The contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, confirming the diagnosis of ileo-colic intussusception.

Crohn's ileitis is less likely in this case, as it typically presents with chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other systemic symptoms. Foreign body ingestion and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine would present with different clinical features and imaging findings, making them less likely diagnoses in this case.

B: Perform a vitreous tap and administer intravitreal injection of antifungal agents.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of CMV infection and the presence of a central scotoma, it is important to consider CMV retinitis as a possible cause. Performing a vitreous tap and administering intravitreal injection of antifungal agents (such as ganciclovir) would be the appropriate next step to treat and confirm the diagnosis of CMV retinitis. Neuroimaging and lumbar puncture may be considered if there are other neurologic symptoms or signs suggesting central nervous system involvement, but these are not described in the case. Systemic steroid treatment would not be appropriate in this case as it may exacerbate CMV infection.

A: Chorioretinal biopsy

Explanation: Given the presence of a choroidal infiltrate of unknown cause and the unrevealing results from testing for neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious processes, a chorioretinal biopsy would be the next step to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This biopsy can help identify the underlying cause of the choroidal infiltrate and guide further treatment decisions.

D: Perform emergency canthotomy and cantholysis to decompress the orbits.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including blurred vision, diplopia, proptosis, limited extraocular motility, esotropia, and hypertropia, along with the findings of chorioretinal folds and intraretinal hemorrhages on fundus examination, suggest the presence of orbital compartment syndrome (OCS). OCS is a sight-threatening condition that occurs due to increased intraorbital pressure, leading to ischemia of the optic nerve and retina. Emergency canthotomy and cantholysis is the treatment of choice for relieving the pressure and preventing irreversible vision loss. Prompt action is necessary to decompress the orbits and preserve the patient's vision.

602
I would choose answer option B: Orbitotomy with biopsy.

Explanation: The presentation of bilateral sequential acute proptosis in this patient, along with the findings on imaging and laboratory workup, suggest a possible orbital inflammatory syndrome, such as IgG4-related disease or idiopathic orbital inflammation. These conditions typically require histopathological confirmation to establish a diagnosis. Orbitotomy with biopsy is the most appropriate next step to obtain tissue samples for further evaluation and to rule out other causes of proptosis, such as malignancy or infection. Empirical corticosteroid treatment may be considered as initial therapy while awaiting biopsy results, but it should not replace histopathological confirmation. External beam radiotherapy may be a potential treatment option for orbital inflammatory syndromes, but it is typically reserved for cases refractory to corticosteroid treatment. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is not indicated in this case since there are no findings suggestive of infection.

603
Answer: B: Recommend continued blood glucose control and consider intravitreal anti-VEGF injection or focal laser treatment if the macular edema persists.

Explanation: The patient has a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a risk factor for diabetic retinopathy. However, the patient reports no history of diabetic retinopathy. The dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography show retinal exudates, hemorrhages, and cystoid abnormalities, indicating macular edema. This suggests the development of diabetic macular edema (DME) in the right eye. DME is a common complication of diabetic retinopathy.

In this case, the recommended approach would be to first focus on optimizing blood glucose control. This is important for managing diabetic retinopathy and DME. Tight glycemic control can help reduce the progression of retinopathy and the associated macular edema.

Additionally, considering intravitreal anti-VEGF injection or focal laser treatment if the macular edema persists would be appropriate. Anti-VEGF injections and focal laser treatment are established treatments for DME and can help reduce macular edema and improve visual outcomes.

Therefore, option B is the most suitable recommendation based on the patient's history, clinical findings, and available treatment options.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including fluctuating left eye swelling and redness, left eye discomfort, left-sided tinnitus, binocular horizontal diplopia, left eye abduction deficit, widened pulse pressure of the left eye, dilated nasal episcleral vessels, conjunctival chemosis, and subconjunctival hemorrhage, raise concern for a possible cause involving the brain or orbits. To further evaluate the underlying cause, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits should be performed. This will help identify any structural abnormalities or lesions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Urgent referral to neurosurgery may be necessary depending on the results of the MRI. Reassurance and artificial tears alone would not address the potential underlying cause and may not be sufficient for management in this case. Computed tomography of the head could provide some information, but an MRI is more sensitive and specific for evaluating soft tissue structures.

605
C: Perform head/maxillofacial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation: The patient's presentation of blurred vision and floaters, along with sinus congestion and left-sided jaw pain, raises concerns for underlying sinus or orbital pathology. Therefore, performing head/maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would help evaluate the sinuses, orbits, and surrounding structures for any abnormalities or infections that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This imaging can provide valuable information about any potential causes of the vitreous inflammation and help guide further management. It is an important step in the diagnostic workup of this patient.

606
A: Secondary syphilis

Explanation: The patient's history of syphilis treatment and the characteristic presentation of hyperpigmented papules and plaques with violaceous borders on the soles of his feet are consistent with a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. The biopsy findings of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells within the infiltrate further support this diagnosis. The ulcers on the buccal mucosa and penile ulcer are also typical manifestations of secondary syphilis. The patient's HIV status and history of pembrolizumab treatment for lung cancer are important considerations, as they can affect the immune response to infections and the development of skin eruptions.
C
cellvalue empty
607
B: Computed tomographic imaging of the chest

Explanation: The patient's history of congenital heart disease puts her at risk for infective endocarditis, which is a known cause of brain abscesses. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the presence of any intracardiac shunts or valvular abnormalities that could be the source of the infection. Computed tomographic imaging of the chest would help identify any structural abnormalities or evidence of infective endocarditis. Although a transesophageal echocardiogram may provide more detailed information, it is an invasive procedure and can be reserved for cases with high clinical suspicion or inconclusive results from the CT scan. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can also be considered to provide additional information, but it is not the initial test of choice. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study is less sensitive than a transesophageal echocardiogram and may not provide adequate visualization of potential sources of infection in this case. Therefore, option B (Computed tomographic imaging of the chest) is the most appropriate next step.
D
cellvalue empty
608
Explanation: Based on the imaging findings and the patient's history, the most likely diagnosis is A: Squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of a soft-tissue mass involving the nasopharynx, sphenoid sinus, and clivus, with erosion of the bone and avid enhancement on imaging, is highly suggestive of a malignant tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of head and neck cancer that can arise in the nasopharynx. The patient's risk factors, including chronic hepatitis C, alcoholism, and hypothyroidism, are also associated with an increased risk of developing head and neck cancers. Lymphoma (B) typically presents as a more diffuse involvement of the lymphoid tissues and would not cause bone erosion. Ectopic pituitary adenoma (C) would typically involve the sella and cause sellar or suprasellar mass effect, which is not seen in this case. Granulomatous disease (D) would not typically present as a large, enhancing mass involving the nasopharynx and sinuses.
C
609
The answer to the case is C: Primary middle ear meningioma.

Explanation: The patient presented with a history of left ear fullness and diminished left-sided hearing that temporarily improved with autoinsufflation. Physical examination revealed a retrotympanic, nonpulsatile, tan-gray mass anterior to the malleus handle. The tuning fork examination showed lateralization to the left ear and bone conduction louder than air conduction on the left side. An audiogram confirmed mild conductive hearing loss in the left ear.

Imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), revealed a middle ear lesion lateral to the geniculate ganglion with possible extension into the peritubal space. The lesion appeared enhanced on MRI. The patient eventually experienced progressive hearing loss, persistent ear fullness, and rare facial twitching. Transcanal endoscopy demonstrated a gray middle ear mass occupying the anterior mesotympanum and epitympanum and extending into the eustachian tube.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological analysis, the diagnosis of primary middle ear meningioma is most likely.
C
610
The correct answer is D: Encephalocele.

Explanation: The presentation of a pedunculated mass in the anterior nasal cavity with no fluid, negative Furstenberg sign, and a hyperintense fatty component on MRI suggests an encephalocele. Encephaloceles are herniation of brain and meninges through a defect in the skull, and they can present with nasal obstruction and other craniofacial abnormalities. Dermoid cysts (choice A) are usually midline masses composed of ectodermal elements and can have sebaceous material or dermal appendages. Hairy polyps (choice B) are rare polypoid masses in the nasopharynx that typically contain adipose tissue and respiratory epithelium, often with hair. Gliomas (choice C) are tumors composed of neuroglial cells and typically occur in the brain or spinal cord, not the nasal cavity.
B
611
C: Xeroderma pigmentosum

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and the findings on physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, leading to severe sunburn and an increased risk of developing skin cancer. The early onset of freckles and their progression into warty lesions, along with the development of rapidly progressing malignant tumors, are consistent with XP.

The severe disfigurement of the patient's face and the presence of numerous ulcerative tumors are also typical features of XP. The genetic testing was recommended but declined, which could have confirmed the diagnosis by identifying mutations in genes associated with XP.

Trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome are also rare genetic disorders associated with sun sensitivity, but they present with additional symptoms such as brittle hair and intellectual disability, which were not observed in this case. Actinic keratosis is a common precancerous skin condition that does not typically present with the severe manifestations seen in this patient.
C
612
Answer: A

Explanation: The elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) level is nonspecific and further evaluation with a lung biopsy is warranted. While an elevated VEGF-D level can be seen in certain lung diseases, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis (option C), pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (option B), and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (option D), it is not diagnostic for any specific condition. Lung biopsy is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the diffuse thin-walled pulmonary cysts seen on the chest CT scan.
The answer is D: Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of joint pain and swelling, along with the presence of a malar rash and a positive ANA result, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints. The presence of a malar rash is characteristic of SLE.

The next step in evaluating this patient would be to order specific serologic testing for SLE. The most specific test for SLE is the anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody test. While this test is commonly used to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, it can also be positive in patients with SLE and can help in differentiating between the two conditions.

The other answer options are less likely to be helpful in the evaluation of this patient. Checking for anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies is more specific for SLE, but the CCP antibody test is a more sensitive test. Scheduling bilateral hand radiographs would be useful if there was suspicion for erosive arthritis or bony changes, which is not described in the case. Ordering serologic testing for parvovirus is not indicated as there is no specific mention of symptoms consistent with a parvovirus infection in the patient or her family members.

D: Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with polyarthritis, which is characterized by joint pain and inflammation in multiple joints. The presence of a malar rash and positive ANA result further raises suspicion for a connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ordering anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody testing can help differentiate between SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as a positive result is highly specific for RA. In this case, the negative rheumatoid factor and normal inflammatory marker levels make RA less likely, and thus, testing for anti-CCP antibody is the most appropriate next step.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
D: Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of joint pain and swelling, along with a malar rash and a positive ANA result, raises suspicion for an autoimmune condition, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of arthritis involving the small joints of the hands further supports this suspicion. The anti-CCP antibody test is specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can help differentiate between RA and SLE, as well as other inflammatory joint diseases. Since the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with an inflammatory arthritis, ordering the anti-CCP antibody test would be the most appropriate next step in the evaluation. Testing for anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies is more specific for SLE and would be considered if the clinical suspicion for SLE is higher. Bilateral hand radiographs are not necessary at this point in the evaluation, as they are unlikely to impact the initial management. Serologic testing for parvovirus would not be indicated based on the patient's history and clinical presentation.

A: Test results indicate presence of IgG4-related disease.

Explanation: The elevated immunoglobulin G subgroup 4 (IgG4) levels suggest the presence of IgG4-related disease, which is characterized by fibroinflammatory lesions affecting multiple organs such as the pancreas, kidneys, salivary glands, and lymph nodes. This disease can cause pancreatic enlargement and hypoenhancement on imaging, similar to pancreatic cancer. However, fine-needle aspiration showed no malignancy, and the patient's nonsecretor status for carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 makes pancreatic cancer less likely. Further evaluation and monitoring of IgG4-related disease should be considered.

My diagnosis is B: Mucormycosis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including severe pain, rapidly growing oral lesions, and a necrotic area on the left hard palate, is highly suggestive of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a rare but life-threatening fungal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. It primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with hematologic malignancies, diabetes mellitus, or severe malnutrition. The patient's significant medical history of refractory leukemia, immunosuppression, and malnutrition further supports this diagnosis.

The histologic evaluation of the sloughed tissue and the maxillofacial CT scan completed the etiological investigation and likely showed characteristic features associated with mucormycosis, such as tissue enlargement in the left hard palate and maxillary sinus. A biopsy was not performed due to the patient's medical instability.

Prompt antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and surgical intervention, such as debridement or resection of the affected tissue, are typically required for the management of mucormycosis.

616
Answer: D: Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis

Explanation: The patient's presentation of multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area that were present at birth and gradually increased in size and number is consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis (IGH). IGH is a benign and common dermatological condition characterized by small, discrete, hypopigmented macules typically found on sun-exposed areas, such as the extremities. The histopathological examination revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis, which are consistent with the findings seen in IGH. Tinea versicolor, vitiligo, and clear cell papulosis are less likely in this case based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings. Tinea versicolor would typically show hyphae on direct microscopic examination, which was not observed in this case. Vitiligo would typically present with depigmented macules that are not well-demarcated and may be present on other body sites besides the abdomen and pubic area. Clear cell papulosis is a rare condition characterized by benign clear cell aggregates in the dermis, which is not consistent with the histopathological findings in this case.

I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based assistant, I am unable to view or examine images. I am also not qualified to make medical diagnoses. It is recommended that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis based on the symptoms and findings described in the case. They will be able to provide a proper evaluation and explanation.
C: Adhesive small bowel obstruction

Explanation: The patient's presentation with progressively worsening postprandial symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and significant weight loss, is suggestive of a chronic condition. The fact that the patient had a previous diagnosis of adhesive small bowel obstruction and underwent laparotomy and lysis of adhesive bands that provided temporary relief further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the intraoperative findings of the small bowel appearance consistent with adhesive obstruction confirm the diagnosis. The positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result indicates exposure to tuberculosis but is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and findings. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis and peritoneal carcinomatosis are less likely given the patient's history of prostate cancer treated with robotic prostatectomy without evidence of recurrence.

The answer option is D: Infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of weight loss, anorexia, and back pain, along with his medical history of an aortic aneurysm repair with ligation of the left renal vein, are indicative of a potential complication related to the aortic graft. The physical examination findings suggesting postthrombotic syndrome further support this. The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would likely show signs of infection around the aortic graft and a potential fistula between the graft and the duodenum. This condition, known as an infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula, can present with nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss and back pain. It is a serious and life-threatening complication that requires immediate surgical intervention.

C: Check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels

Explanation: The findings described in the case, including the presence of elevated, hypopigmented lesions with retinal pigment epithelium changes, subretinal fluid, and subretinal hemorrhage, along with the ultrasonographic appearance of calcifications, suggest the possibility of sclerochoroidal calcifications. Sclerochoroidal calcifications are rare and can occur in association with systemic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, checking parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels would be the next appropriate step to assess for any underlying metabolic abnormalities that may be contributing to the development of the lesions. Transvitreous biopsy or oral corticosteroid therapy may not be indicated at this point without further diagnostic workup. Plaque brachytherapy is not indicated for this condition.

B: Order a hormone profile (thyrotropin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone, and testosterone) and consult endocrinology 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of short stature, hypochondroplasia, alopecia, and generalized hypotonia, it is important to evaluate his hormone levels to assess for any endocrine abnormalities that may be contributing to his symptoms. This can be accomplished by ordering a hormone profile which includes tests for thyrotropin (thyroid function), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (adrenal function), growth hormone (pituitary function), and testosterone (testicular function). Consultation with an endocrinologist will help interpret these results and guide further management.

D: Review medications.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of long-standing hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease, it is important to review her medications as potential contributors to her visual symptoms. Certain medications, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, can cause retinal toxicity and present with similar symptoms including night blindness and ring scotoma. These medications are commonly used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and should be assessed in this case. Reviewing the medications will help determine if any need to be discontinued or adjusted to improve the patient's visual symptoms.

I would choose D: Initiate corticosteroids.

Explanation: The patient is presenting with a 2-year history of diplopia, optic disc edema, and amaurosis (graying of vision). The presence of chronic-appearing optic disc edema, relative afferent pupillary defect, and visual field abnormalities suggest that the patient has optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is often treated with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and speed up recovery.

C: Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified

Explanation: The patient is presenting with inferior ST-segment elevation, indicating an acute myocardial infarction. The next step should be to identify the culprit coronary artery responsible for the occlusion. This can be done through coronary angiography, which has already been performed. However, the angiogram does not clearly demonstrate the culprit artery. Therefore, the recommended next step is to pursue the identification of the culprit coronary artery before proceeding with any interventions.
API request failed on attempt 1. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified. 

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads on the electrocardiogram, suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. The patient was hemodynamically unstable, indicating the need for urgent intervention. Since the coronary angiography has not yet identified the culprit coronary artery responsible for the patient's symptoms, it would be appropriate to pursue further investigation to determine the appropriate intervention. This could involve additional diagnostic imaging or further angiography to identify the specific artery requiring intervention. Thus, the next step would be to pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified (Option C).
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with chest pain, ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and hemodynamic instability. The next step would be to identify the culprit coronary artery responsible for the ischemic event. The patient should undergo urgent coronary angiography to identify the lesion responsible for the ST-segment elevation and proceed with coronary intervention if necessary. Option A (perform coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery) assumes that the left anterior descending artery is the culprit without confirming it. Option B (determine severity of the left anterior descending artery plaque by measuring fractional flow reserve) assumes that the left anterior descending artery plaque is the culprit without confirming it. Option D (order urgent computed tomography angiography) may provide additional information but is not necessary in this urgent situation. Therefore, the best course of action is to pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified, as outlined in option C.

The answer is B: Amyloidosis.

Explanation: The presentation of a nodular lesion in the upper trachea originating from the right lobe of the thyroid, along with dyspnea and wheezing, suggests an aggressive thyroid malignant neoplasm. However, the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) did not find a nodule in the right thyroid lobe that correlated with the CT findings. Instead, a biopsy of an 8 mm nodule in the left thyroid lobe revealed medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). This suggests that the intratracheal mass is not a primary thyroid cancer but rather another condition.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck showed a hyperintense tracheal mass on T2-weighted imaging, which is consistent with amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by the deposition of insoluble protein fibrils (amyloid) in various organs and tissues. In the neck, it can present as a soft-tissue mass within the tracheal lumen.

The presence of a nonenhancing nodule at the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe, separate from the tracheal mass, is likely unrelated to the primary condition and may represent a benign thyroid rest.

Therefore, based on the clinical findings and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is B: Amyloidosis.
C
630
B: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, progressive headaches, and bloody mucus on nasal endoscopy, along with the radiographic findings of soft tissue destruction in the sinuses and skull base, are highly suggestive of a sinonasal process. The presence of multinucleated giant cells and necrosis on sinonasal mucosal biopsy further support the diagnosis of acute invasive fungal sinusitis. Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, often seen in immunocompromised individuals, which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment with antifungal agents and possible surgical debridement.
C
631
B: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks, along with the extension of swelling to the upper lip, difficulty swallowing, and nasal drainage, is consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis. The physical examination findings of diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting further support this diagnosis. The imaging findings on CT and MRI, demonstrating marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, as well as areas of necrosis and emphysema, are also consistent with this diagnosis.
A
632
The diagnosis is D: Myositis ossificans.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is myositis ossificans. Myositis ossificans refers to the formation of heterotopic bone within muscle tissue, typically following trauma or injury. It commonly presents as a firm, tender, and mobile mass in the affected area.

In this case, the patient's history of a motor vehicle accident, progression of the neck mass over 3 years, and the presence of a well-circumscribed ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue all suggest myositis ossificans. The absence of aggressive-appearing periosteal reaction and the separation of the lesion from the underlying bone further support this diagnosis.

Other options can be ruled out:
A: Osteochondroma: Osteochondromas usually arise from the bone surface and do not typically present as a soft tissue mass.
B: Osteoid osteoma: Osteoid osteomas, although typically presenting with localized pain, do not usually present as a mobile soft tissue mass.
C: Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcomas are aggressive malignancies with different radiographic features than what is seen in this case.
D
633
B: Obtain an HIV immunoassay.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with fever, rash, and abnormal liver function test results is concerning for a possible viral infection. Given the patient's risk factors (recent travel, potential exposure to different environments), it is important to consider infectious causes, including HIV. Obtaining an HIV immunoassay will help determine if HIV infection is present and guide further management. This test should be performed as part of the initial workup to rule out HIV as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms and abnormal liver function.

634
The answer option is D: The patient has warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Explanation: The patient's laboratory results show normocytic anemia with an overall normal reticulocyte count, which suggests a hemolytic process rather than bone marrow suppression. The presence of conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus indicates anemia and jaundice, which are consistent with hemolysis. The slightly elevated LDH levels further support hemolysis. In warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoantibodies bind to red blood cells at body temperature (hence the term "warm") and cause their destruction. This condition is commonly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders such as CLL.
D

635
C: Perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, electrocardiogram findings, elevated troponin level, and angiography results are consistent with a diagnosis of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Given the presence of apical akinesis and obstructive coronary artery disease as seen on angiography, revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred treatment option for this patient. PCI involves the placement of stents to open up the blocked coronary artery and restore blood flow to the heart muscle.

636
The correct answer is D: There are insufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred.

Explanation: The given information does not provide enough evidence to determine a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Although the patient has acute respiratory failure and low urine output, it is important to consider that these findings can also be attributed to the acute illness, sepsis, or decreased renal perfusion. The change in serum creatinine being within the coefficient of variation suggests that it could still be within the normal range. Therefore, further evaluation and monitoring are required to make a definitive conclusion about the patient's renal function.
B
cellvalue empty
637
The correct answer is B: Inverse lichen planus.

Explanation:
The description of the lesions as discrete, circular, violaceous patches in the axilla, along with severe pruritus, suggests the diagnosis of inverse lichen planus. Inverse lichen planus is a variant of lichen planus that primarily affects intertriginous areas, such as the axillae, groin, and anogenital region. It typically presents as violaceous, well-circumscribed plaques without scaling or erosion. The intense pruritus is a characteristic feature. Wood lamp examination is usually negative in lichen planus. 

The other conditions listed can be ruled out based on the information provided: 

- Familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease) typically presents with vesicles and erosions, which are not described in this case.
- Fixed drug eruption presents as well-defined erythematous patches or plaques following exposure to a specific medication, which the patient denies.
- Erythrasma is characterized by brownish-red, scaly patches in skin folds, particularly in the groin or axilla. It is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum infection. The description of violaceous, discrete patches without scale or erosion is not consistent with erythrasma.
B

638
The correct answer is D: Oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The key features that point towards oral squamous cell carcinoma in this case are the patient's age, associated risk factors (such as chronic immunosuppression, mycosis fungoides), and the appearance of a nonremovable white plaquelike lesion on the tongue. The histologic findings of hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and abnormal epithelial nuclei further support this diagnosis. Oral frictional keratosis typically resolves when the source of friction is removed, and oral lichen planus usually presents with bilateral white lace-like patches. Oral hairy leukoplakia is typically seen in immunosuppressed individuals and presents as white, corrugated lesions on the sides of the tongue. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm that can arise in the oral cavity and should be considered in cases of persistent, nonhealing white lesions in high-risk individuals.

639
B: Subungual melanoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a new pigmented lesion on the toenail, progressive growth, and corresponding thickening of the nail plate is concerning for subungual melanoma. The pigmented band extending to the proximal nail fold further supports this diagnosis. The histopathologic examination is essential to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.

640
B: Pharmacotherapy with low-dose atypical antipsychotics

Explanation: Based on the presenting symptoms of social withdrawal, reduced interest, unusual beliefs about being talked about, perplexity, and derealization, the most appropriate course of action would be to initiate pharmacotherapy with low-dose atypical antipsychotics. These symptoms suggest the presence of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, which can be effectively treated with antipsychotic medications. A referral to a psychiatrist should be made to initiate the appropriate treatment and provide ongoing monitoring.

The answer is C: Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay.

Explanation: The clinical findings described, including unsteadiness, frequent falls, appendicular ataxia, spastic gait, absence of Achilles tendon reflexes, and decreased vibration sense, are consistent with the diagnosis of Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). The fundoscopic findings of increased visibility of retinal nerve fibers and thickened retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) are also characteristic of this condition.

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (A) is a mitochondrial disorder that primarily affects the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. Friedreich ataxia (B) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and causes progressive loss of coordination and muscle weakness. Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (D) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical and ophthalmological findings is Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (C).
C

642
The correct answer is C: Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia).

Explanation: Based on the patient's history of multiple lumbar fusion surgeries, the slowly enlarging bulge in the left midback, and the physical examination findings of a soft, fixed, and nonreducible mass, the most likely diagnosis is a superior lumbar hernia. These hernias occur through defects in the posterior abdominal wall, specifically through the superior lumbar triangle of Grynfeltt-Lesshaft. This area is bounded by the internal oblique muscle medially, the latissimus dorsi muscle posteriorly, and the external oblique muscle anteriorly. The bulge is accentuated with upright posture and coughing, which are typical features of a hernia. Computed tomography imaging can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the herniated contents (such as omentum or bowel) through the defect in the posterior abdominal wall.

643
B: Traumatic vertebral body fracture

Explanation: The plain radiograph of the neck showed tracheal deviation, which is not a common finding in metastatic lung cancer or thyroid goiter. The patient's symptoms of neck and shoulder pain, as well as radiating pain down the right arm, are consistent with musculoskeletal symptoms and are not typical of metastatic lung cancer. The presence of tracheal deviation on imaging suggests a compression or displacement of nearby structures, which is more consistent with a traumatic vertebral body fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine would provide additional information about the extent and severity of the fracture.

644
I would choose answer option C: Obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agents. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including anterior chamber cell, vitritis, retinal whitening with scalloped margins, and intraretinal hemorrhages, are consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), which is a severe viral infection of the retina. The most common causative viruses are herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). To confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific viral pathogen, obtaining an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is appropriate. Treatment with antiviral agents, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, is necessary to control the viral infection and prevent progression of the disease.
C

645
C: Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy

Explanation: Based on the patient's history, clinical findings, and imaging results, the likely diagnosis is orbital inflammatory disease or idiopathic orbital inflammation. Oral corticosteroid treatment is the initial approach for managing these conditions, as it has been effective in previous episodes for this patient. Additionally, performing a biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the symptoms.
C

646
Based on the information provided, the next step would be to choose option B: Further taper her corticosteroid dosage and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, examination findings, and history suggest a diagnosis of pigmentary dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma associated with laser iris injury. PDS typically presents with iris transillumination defects, pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber, and iris atrophy. The patient's symptoms of blurred vision and photophobia, along with the examination findings of iris irregularities and posterior synechiae, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Treatment typically involves corticosteroid therapy to reduce inflammation and break posterior synechiae. In this case, the patient has already been receiving difluprednate, a corticosteroid, but with minimal improvement in symptoms. Therefore, the next step is to taper her corticosteroid dosage further and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae. Cycloplegic agents help to relax the ciliary muscle and reduce inflammation, allowing for better iris movement and preventing further synechiae formation.

Performing AC paracentesis and sending fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis (option C) would not be the most appropriate next step, as there are no indications of viral infection based on the patient's history and examination findings.

Performing urgent peripheral iridotomy given IOP asymmetry (option D) would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient's pigment dispersion syndrome is the primary cause of her symptoms, and the IOP asymmetry is likely secondary to that. Additionally, iridotomy is not typically indicated for pigment dispersion syndrome.

Therefore, option B is the best next step in managing this patient's symptoms and condition.
B
cellvalue empty
647
B: Perform gonioscopy

Explanation:
Given the patient's presentation of acute-onset blurry vision, pain, corneal microcystic edema, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP), a possible complication of the previous ocular trauma is angle-closure glaucoma. Gonioscopy is the appropriate next step as it allows for visualization of the angle structures to assess for any signs of angle closure or narrowing. This would help determine the underlying cause of the increased IOP and guide further management. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is not indicated at this time, as there are no neurologic symptoms or signs. Instilling a miotic agent or performing peripheral iridotomy would also not be appropriate until the extent and underlying cause of the angle closure is determined through gonioscopy.

648
Based on the given clinical presentation of facial plethora, dilated retinal veins, blot hemorrhages, prolonged arm-to-retina transit time, and an area of bruising on the right shoulder, the most appropriate next step would be to perform genetic testing for the VHL gene. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a possible systemic condition, and one of the key differentials to consider is Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. VHL is an inherited familial cancer syndrome that predisposes individuals to the development of multiple benign and malignant tumors, including hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and retina. It can also manifest with retinal vascular abnormalities such as dilated retinal veins and blot hemorrhages. A genetic test for the VHL gene can help confirm or rule out this diagnosis, which would be important for the patient's long-term management and surveillance of associated tumors. Therefore, option D: Perform genetic testing for the VHL gene is the most appropriate next step.
C

649
B: Initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after HLA-A29 laboratory analysis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with atypical white dot syndrome, which includes conditions such as birdshot chorioretinopathy. The characteristic findings of multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits with parafoveal coalescence, along with choroidal thickening and irregularity of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium, suggest an inflammatory process. The lack of concomitant vitritis is also a distinguishing feature. The most appropriate next step would be to initiate treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after confirming the diagnosis with HLA-A29 laboratory analysis. This is necessary because birdshot chorioretinopathy is strongly associated with the HLA-A29 allele, and a positive result would support the diagnosis and guide further management. Observation alone (A) may lead to disease progression and permanent vision loss. A hematologic workup (C) and vitreous biopsy (D) are not indicated in this case.
C

650
The diagnosis is D: Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and histologic analysis all point towards a diagnosis of a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. The presence of fleshy, whitish endobronchial lesions obstructing both uptakes, along with the histologic features of enlarged vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, suggest a high-grade malignancy.

Furthermore, the immunohistochemical staining profile, with strong and diffuse positivity for keratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, and p63, helps to narrow down the differential diagnosis. These markers are commonly expressed in carcinomas, particularly squamous cell carcinoma.

The presence of abrupt squamous differentiation, keratinization, and intercellular bridges further supports the diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The extensive metastases to skeletal sites seen on positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan are also characteristic of an aggressive malignancy.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (Option A).

Based on the given information, the next step in the management of this comatose patient would be to perform a Transesophageal Echocardiography (D). 

Explanation: 
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a diagnostic procedure that involves the insertion of a specialized probe into the esophagus to obtain detailed images of the heart. TEE is useful in this case because it can provide information about the cardiac structure and function, allowing for the evaluation of potential causes of cardiac arrest, such as myocardial infarction, valvular abnormalities, or pericardial effusion. TEE can help identify any cardiac abnormalities that may have caused the patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent comatose state. This information will guide further management decisions.
C: Vocal fold granuloma

Explanation: The patient's history of cigarette smoking, presence of a nodular cystic-appearing lesion on the vocal fold, and submucosal white caseous debris suggest a diagnosis of vocal fold granuloma. Laryngeal tuberculosis typically presents with ulceration and involvement of multiple sites, while laryngeal gout is rare and usually presents as an acute inflammatory episode. Laryngeal amyloidosis typically presents with polypoid or mass-like lesions and can cause dysphonia or dysphagia.
B
653
The diagnosis for this case is C: Kimura disease.

Explanation: Kimura disease is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that predominantly affects young Asian males. It is characterized by painless, subcutaneous masses predominantly in the head and neck region, including bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. The swelling is usually soft, nontender, and gradually progressive. It is often associated with elevated serum eosinophil count and IgE levels. The histopathological features include lymphoid follicles with prominent germinal centers, a significant eosinophilic infiltrate, and marked proliferation of post-capillary venules.

Other options can be ruled out based on the clinical features and investigation findings. Hodgkin lymphoma typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy, weight loss, night sweats, and fever. Tubercular lymphadenitis is more commonly associated with a history of tuberculosis exposure, systemic symptoms, and caseation necrosis on histopathology. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia presents with single or multiple red-purple nodules that are commonly found in the head and neck region, but the clinical features and characteristics of the swelling in this case are not consistent with this condition.
C
654
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is C: Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

Explanation: Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is a rare tumor that arises from antigen-presenting cells in lymphoid tissue. It commonly presents as a rapidly enlarging mass in the head and neck region, including the parapharyngeal area. The diagnosis can be challenging and often requires immunohistochemical analysis for definitive diagnosis. In this case, the positive findings for CD21 and CD23, markers of follicular dendritic cells, support the diagnosis of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. The other answer options (A: Poorly undifferentiated carcinoma, B: Ectopic thymoma, D: Peripheral nerve sheath tumor) do not fit the clinical presentation and immunohistochemical findings described in the case.
C
655
B: Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis

Explanation: The patient's history of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension puts her at an increased risk for developing right-sided endocarditis. Additionally, the presence of multiple lung nodules raises concerns for potential septic emboli. Therefore, it is important to perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis as a potential cause of the lung nodules. This will help guide the appropriate treatment plan for the patient.

B: Perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of hypoesthesia and the presence of perineural granulomas on the previous biopsy, further investigation is necessary to determine the etiology of the hyperpigmented macule and diminished sensation. A diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and the right ulnar nerve would provide more information for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Answer: D: The patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage.

Explanation: In this case, the patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b and underwent VCTE prior to treatment, which showed no significant fibrosis. After successful treatment with simeprevir and sofosbuvir, laboratory studies and VCTE were performed again. However, we do not have access to Table 1 and the specific results of these tests. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the level of fibrosis or whether the patient has cirrhosis based solely on the information provided. A liver biopsy is needed to accurately confirm the fibrosis stage.

658
B: The patient has masked uncontrolled hypertension.

Explanation: The patient's 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring shows elevated blood pressure levels overall, especially during the daytime and after specific triggers like waking up with a panic attack and eating a high-sodium breakfast. These episodes of elevated blood pressure are not captured during office BP measurements, indicating masked uncontrolled hypertension.

The correct answer is A: Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

Explanation: Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the genital and perianal areas, but can also involve other areas such as the palms and wrists. The characteristic features include well-marginated hyperpigmented patches with atrophy and the presence of spiny keratotic pits in the affected areas. The histopathologic examination typically shows a flattened epidermis, loss of rete ridges, and a lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a late stage manifestation of Lyme disease and typically affects the extensor surfaces of the limbs, not the palms. Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma and sclerotylosis are not consistent with the clinical presentation described.

660
The correct answer is A: Trichodysplasia spinulosa.

Explanation:
Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare skin condition that typically occurs in immunosuppressed individuals, such as organ transplant recipients. It is characterized by the development of multiple flesh-colored follicular papules and keratin spines on the face and trunk, as seen in the provided photographs. These lesions can be mildly pruritic.

The skin biopsy findings in this case, with dilatation and keratotic plugging of the hair infundibula, enlargement and irregular trichohyaline granules in the inner root sheath cells, and apoptotic cells with abrupt cornification without a granular layer, are consistent with trichodysplasia spinulosa.

Immunohistochemical analysis for SV40 polyomavirus was positive, which is a known association with trichodysplasia spinulosa.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is A: Trichodysplasia spinulosa.

661
B: Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans. This condition is characterized by recurrent annular plaques that occur primarily on the trunk, have a distinctive well-demarcated papular border, and tend to resolve spontaneously by the beginning of autumn. The absence of epidermal changes, mild dermal edema, and a superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate seen on biopsy also support this diagnosis. Granuloma annulare typically presents with a more generalized distribution of lesions, deep erythema annulare centrifugum often has a scale at the advancing edge of the lesion, and erythema chronicum migrans is associated with Lyme disease and typically presents with a central clearing and a target-like appearance.
B

662
Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is A: Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease).

Explanation: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic disease, is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the optic nerves and spinal cord. Symptoms commonly include bilateral loss of vision, loss of hearing, paresthesias (abnormal sensations), and motor weakness. The patient in the case presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing, along with painful paresthesias in the feet. The abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves seen on MRI is consistent with optic nerve inflammation, which is a characteristic finding in NMO.

Other diagnostic features supporting NMO in this case include absent bone conduction hearing, length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation, absent reflexes in the lower extremities, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein levels. Normal results for various laboratory tests such as nerve conduction studies, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and autoimmune panels helped rule out other conditions.

Treatment with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis is a common approach to manage NMO, although it did not lead to improvement in the patient's symptoms in this case.

Amyloidosis (B), Susac syndrome (C), and cobalt toxicity (D) are less likely diagnoses based on the given information.
D

663
The correct answer is B: Colonic ischemia.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, vomiting, and melena raises concern for an acute abdominal condition. The physical examination findings of localized tenderness, rebound, and voluntary guarding further support an intra-abdominal pathology. The laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which is indicative of an inflammatory process. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings demonstrate segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, suggesting ischemia and potential perforation. Additionally, there is adjacent fat stranding and a lucency medial to the cecum, indicating possible free air and intra-abdominal inflammation. The presence of bilateral renal hypodensities on CT may suggest sepsis or multi-organ involvement. Infectious colitis may cause similar symptoms, but the CT findings are more consistent with colonic ischemia. Acute appendicitis typically presents with pain in the right lower quadrant, but the CT findings in this case are not consistent with appendicitis. Diverticulitis with perforation is a possibility, but the CT findings do not show the typical diverticula or diverticulitis findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is colonic ischemia.
B
cellvalue empty
664
The correct answer is D: Malignant growth with unknown primary tumor.

Explanation: The patient's history of endometriosis and adenomyosis, along with the presence of a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and a bulky uterus with thickened myometrium, suggests a gynecological origin for her symptoms. The elevated cancer antigen 125 level further supports the presence of a malignant process. The CT and MRI findings of multiple implants in the omentum and cul-de-sac are consistent with metastatic disease rather than a benign process like endometriosis or diverticulum. The presence of right pleural effusion and lymph node enlargement are also suggestive of malignant involvement. Given the lack of a known primary tumor, this is likely a case of a malignant growth with an unknown primary origin.
C

665
I would choose option D: Perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's history and clinical findings, further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the lacrimal gland mass and associated symptoms. Since the previous biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process, performing a second biopsy can help provide more information and potentially identify the specific cause of the swelling and other symptoms. This additional biopsy can help guide the appropriate treatment plan for the patient.
D

666
Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an orbitotomy with excision (Option B). 

Explanation: The presentation of a large compressible mass that transilluminates suggests the presence of a cyst in the right orbit. The mass is causing displacement of the microphthalmic right globe. Given the size and nature of the cyst, it is recommended to perform an orbitotomy with excision to remove the cyst and alleviate the symptoms. Aspiration alone may not completely remove the cyst, and radiotherapy or intralesional corticosteroids are not typically indicated for a cystic lesion in this scenario.
D: Perform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis.

Explanation: Given the history of the patient handling a bloody raccoon carcass without gloves and the presence of elevated inflammatory markers, it is important to consider zoonotic infections such as Bartonella henselae (causing cat-scratch disease) and Francisella tularensis (causing tularemia). Performing serologic testing for these two pathogens will help confirm or rule out their involvement in the patient's symptoms. Conjunctival cultures may not be as useful in this scenario as the presentation is more consistent with a systemic infection rather than an isolated conjunctival infection. Repeating a computed tomography scan is not necessary as the initial scan showed only mild preseptal edema. Reassurance alone is not appropriate given the patient's worsening symptoms and abnormal lab results.

668
B: Indocyanine green angiography, fluorescein angiography, or both.

Explanation: Given the sudden-onset unilateral macular hemorrhage in a middle-aged man with no history of trauma or other symptoms, further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. Indocyanine green angiography (ICG) and fluorescein angiography (FA) are imaging techniques that can provide valuable information about the vasculature of the retina and choroid. These tests can help identify any abnormalities in the blood vessels or any leakage, which can indicate the presence of neovascularization or other pathological processes causing the macular hemorrhage. Both ICG and FA can be performed in the same session, and complement each other in providing comprehensive information about the retinal and choroidal circulation.

669
B: Obtain aqueous sample through needle aspirate for viral polymerase chain reaction, and start intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy.

Explanation: The sudden painful decreased vision, conjunctival hyperemia, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and anterior chamber cells in the right eye suggest acute anterior uveitis. The findings of optic nerve swelling, intraretinal hemorrhages, retinal whitening, and thickening with subretinal fluid on fundus examination, as well as peripheral ischemia on fluorescein angiography suggest a concurrent posterior uveitis. In a patient with unilateral decreased vision and these characteristic findings, it is important to consider infectious causes, particularly viral retinitis, which can present with acute anterior uveitis and posterior uveitis. To confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment, an aqueous sample should be obtained through a needle aspirate for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This will help identify the viral etiology and guide specific antiviral therapy, which should include both intravitreal and systemic administration. Therefore, option B is the appropriate next step.

D: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser.

Explanation: Based on the patient's history of chronic retinal detachment and the presence of yellow-white vitelliform-like lesions in the macula, along with associated fibrotic tissue contraction and early proliferative vitreoretinopathy, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser. This procedure can help address the underlying pathology and potentially resolve the subretinal fluid and vitelliform-like lesions. Other options such as observation, intravitreal corticosteroid injection, or laser photocoagulation may not be sufficient to address the complex nature of the patient's condition.

C: Leukemia cutis

Explanation: Leukemia cutis is the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin and is typically seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It can present with various skin lesions, including papules, nodules, plaques, or patches. The presence of a skin lesion in a patient undergoing induction therapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia raises suspicion for leukemia cutis. Other options such as Brown recluse envenomation, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Mucormycosis are less likely based on the clinical presentation and the patient's underlying condition.

B: Obtain a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram

Explanation: The patient's presentation of dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, jugular venous pressure elevation, and pitting edema in the lower extremities raises suspicion for right heart failure. The elevated mean tricuspid valve gradient on echocardiography suggests the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. A computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram can help evaluate for pulmonary embolism as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms and provide additional information about the pulmonary vasculature. This is an appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup. Fluoroscopy, right heart catheterization, and coronary angiography are not indicated based on the given clinical presentation and findings.

B: The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.

Explanation: The abnormal prothrombin time (PT) suggests an anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban, which is a direct oral anticoagulant. Rivaroxaban affects the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, leading to prolongation of the PT. This puts the patient at an increased risk for bleeding during surgery and requires careful management of the anticoagulant therapy.

C: Perform an oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and the presence of an adrenal mass, the next step would be to evaluate for hyperaldosteronism. This can be done through an oral sodium load test, which involves the administration of a high-sodium diet followed by measurement of aldosterone and renin levels. This test helps to differentiate between primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) and secondary hyperaldosteronism.

The answer is D: Genital herpes simplex virus infection.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of vulvar and buttock ulcers, along with the history of progressively worsening pain, is consistent with genital herpes simplex virus infection. The biopsy specimen obtained from the vulvar ulcer can help confirm the diagnosis. The leukopenia and anemia seen on the blood workup may be related to the underlying viral infection. The patient's lack of sexual activity and absence of sexually transmitted infection history do not rule out genital herpes, as the infection can be acquired through non-sexual routes as well.

A: Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation of persistent facial redness, flares in sunlight, and the development of scarring and atrophy, the most likely diagnosis is chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The negative anti-Ro, anti-La, and qualitative ANA antibodies may not rule out a diagnosis of lupus, as these antibodies can be negative in some cases. The histopathologic review of the punch biopsy specimen will provide further confirmation of the diagnosis.

My diagnosis is C: Annular erythema of infancy.

Explanation: Annular erythema of infancy is a rare benign condition characterized by annular (ring-shaped) erythematous plaques with central clearing. It typically affects infants and young children and presents as asymptomatic plaques on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks. The eruption tends to wax and wane with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week. The borders of the plaques are barely elevated. Laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers and autoimmune antibodies, are usually within normal limits. There is no family history of autoimmune disease, and there is no history of fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods.

The histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen typically shows perivascular and inflammatory infiltrates, which may include eosinophils. This is consistent with the findings described in the case.

Options A and D, Tinea corporis and Erythema migrans, respectively, can be ruled out due to the lack of symptoms such as pruritus, scaling, or known exposure to fungi or ticks.

Option B, Erythema marginatum, is typically associated with rheumatic fever and is characterized by erythematous, non-pruritic, and non-confluent plaques. There is usually a history of sore throat and joint pain, which is not mentioned in the case. Therefore, this diagnosis is less likely.

B: Referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy

Explanation: 
Based on the information provided, this middle-aged woman has severe intractable contamination-based OCD with insufficient response to SSRIs and other medications. The next appropriate step in her treatment would be referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP). ERP is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating OCD. It involves gradually exposing the individual to situations that trigger their obsessive thoughts, while preventing them from engaging in their usual compulsive behaviors. This therapy helps the individual to learn new ways of responding to their obsessions and reduces the urge to perform compulsions.

The correct answer is D: Anti-Ma2 encephalitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, wide-based and unsteady gait, and cognitive changes is highly suggestive of a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome. Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with small-cell lung cancer and presents with a subacute onset of brainstem, limbic, and/or diencephalic dysfunction. The presence of ataxia, memory impairment, and gait instability, along with the development of T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in the right thalamus, inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus on MRI, supports the diagnosis of anti-Ma2 encephalitis in this case.

Myasthenia gravis (A) is unlikely due to the absence of weakness, difficulty swallowing, or breathing. Wernicke encephalopathy (B) is characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental status changes, but it is usually associated with chronic alcoholism and thiamine deficiency, which was not present in this case. Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (C) typically presents with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, but it does not explain the cognitive changes and the presence of brain MRI abnormalities in this patient.
D

680
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is B: Bronchopulmonary sequestration. 

Explanation: Bronchopulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital lung malformation where a mass of non-functioning lung tissue has an abnormal blood supply separate from the normal pulmonary circulation. In this case, the presence of a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying the lung mass seen on the prenatal ultrasound and confirmed on the postnatal CT scan supports the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary sequestration. The resolution of hydrops and improvement in the fetal hydrothorax following placement of a thoracoamniotic shunt also suggests that the mass was the underlying cause of the fetal hydrops. The presence of a left-sided pleural effusion shortly after birth further supports this diagnosis. The patient eventually underwent thoracoscopic resection of the lung mass, which is the treatment of choice for bronchopulmonary sequestration. Teratoma, congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), and carcinoma are less likely diagnoses based on the given information.

B: Shave biopsy of lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's history of basal cell carcinoma on his left cheek and brow and the presence of a suspicious eyelid lesion with associated madarosis, meibomian orifice effacement, and telangiectatic vessels, further investigation is warranted. The next step would be to perform a shave biopsy of the lesion to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological examination. This will help to determine if the lesion is malignant or benign and guide further management decisions. Clinical observation alone may not be sufficient, as the patient's symptoms have not improved with conservative management and he has a history of skin cancer.

682
B: Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and positive blood cultures for Candida glabrata, the optic nerve swelling and retinal findings are likely due to Candida endophthalmitis. Anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium is the appropriate next step for diagnosis and treatment. Foscarnet sodium is an antiviral medication that is effective against both herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Candida species. By performing anterior chamber paracentesis and injecting foscarnet sodium, one can obtain a sample for culture and sensitivity testing, as well as provide direct therapy to the eye. Intravitreal injection of amphotericin B may be considered as an alternative, but given the patient's history of HSV and Enterococcus faecalis infection, foscarnet sodium is preferred because it also covers HSV. Diagnostic vitrectomy may be considered if the paracentesis does not yield a diagnosis or if there is progression of the infection despite treatment. Stereotactic radiation therapy to the optic nerve is not indicated in this case as it is not a treatment for infectious optic nerve swelling.

A: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with and without contrast. 

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of proptosis and ptosis, as well as the findings on examination and CT scan, it is necessary to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with and without contrast. This will help to further evaluate the soft tissues and structures within the orbits, such as the extraocular muscles and optic nerve, and potentially identify any underlying pathology that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

684
B: Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.

Explanation: Shallowing of the anterior chamber after the iridectomy suggests a decrease in intraocular pressure or leakage of fluid from the anterior chamber. In order to re-establish the anterior chamber depth and stability, it is necessary to inflate the chamber. Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices are commonly used for this purpose as they help maintain the anterior chamber depth during surgery.

D: Order an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram.

Explanation: Given the normal examination findings and the absence of any ocular abnormalities on imaging, it is unlikely that the decreased vision is due to cataracts or retinal pathology. In order to further evaluate the cause of the vision loss, performing an electroretinogram (ERG) and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) would be the next step. These tests can assess the overall retinal function and help differentiate between retinal and optic nerve dysfunction. This would provide valuable information in order to determine the cause of the bilateral severe decreased vision.

A: Observe and perform another MRI in 6 months

Explanation:
Given that the patient is asymptomatic and the mass does not have a typical appearance of a vascular malformation or schwannoma, it would be prudent to monitor the mass for any changes over time. Performing another MRI in 6 months would allow for evaluation of any potential growth or changes in the characteristics of the mass. This would help with determining the appropriate next steps in management.

The correct answer is C: Ewing sarcoma (soft-tissue metastasis). 

Explanation: The patient's presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic evaluation are consistent with Ewing sarcoma. The MRI scan showed an inhomogeneous subcutaneous nodule with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm, and histopathologic evaluation confirmed a small round-cell tumor, which was determined to be Ewing sarcoma through immunohistochemical and molecular analysis. The FDG-PET scan also showed high uptake in the right thigh, indicating intense glucose metabolism in the tumor, which is characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. Additionally, another lesion was found in the left ankle joint, with moderate contrast enhancement on MRI. Although the patient reported vague pain in the left ankle, there were no functional limitations or history of trauma at that site. Calcifications were not seen on the ankle radiograph, which helps to differentiate Ewing sarcoma from other differential diagnoses such as synovial sarcoma. Therefore, the correct diagnosis in this case is Ewing sarcoma (soft-tissue metastasis).

688
Answer: D: Pursue urgent valve replacement.

Explanation: The patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with bioprosthetic aortic valve dysfunction, specifically structural valve degeneration (SVD). SVD is a known complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and can present with symptoms of recurrent dyspnea due to aortic stenosis, as seen in this case.

The presence of a mean gradient of 29 mm Hg on transthoracic echo (TTE) and four-dimensional computed tomography (4-D CT) angiography findings of nodular filling defects along all of the leaflets with restricted excursion confirm the diagnosis of bioprosthetic aortic stenosis.

Given the evidence of severe SVD and the patient's symptomatic status, urgent valve replacement is the most appropriate course of action. This may involve either repeat TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), depending on the patient's surgical risk profile and available expertise at the healthcare facility.

Obtaining blood culture samples and administering antibiotics, increasing aspirin dosage, or administering anticoagulation therapy (heparin and warfarin) are not indicated in the management of bioprosthetic aortic stenosis. These interventions would not address the underlying structural valve degeneration and would not provide symptomatic relief.
B

689
The correct answer is C: Collagenous fibroma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a slow-growing fibrous mass in the parapharyngeal space in an otherwise healthy individual suggests a benign neoplasm. The imaging findings, including the location and size of the mass, along with the absence of osseous extension or destruction, are consistent with a collagenous fibroma. Microscopic examination reveals a well-circumscribed, paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix, characteristic of collagenous fibroma. The morphology of the scattered tumor cells resembling myofibroblasts further supports this diagnosis. Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by locally infiltrative fibroblastic proliferation and typically presents as a painless mass. Neurofibroma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 and typically shows diffuse S100 protein positivity. Solitary fibrous tumor is characterized by CD34 positivity and an often hypervascular appearance on imaging. None of these features are described in the case presented.
C
690
A: Perform 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient has been experiencing retrosternal burning and suspected gastroesophageal reflux for 10 years, despite medical management with omeprazole and lifestyle modifications. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) did not reveal any abnormalities. The high-resolution manometry study may help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Given the patient's persistent symptoms and intermittent solid-food dysphagia, 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication is the most appropriate next step. This surgical procedure involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus to create a valve and strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter, ultimately reducing reflux and controlling symptoms.

Esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication may be considered for patients with achalasia or other esophageal motility disorders, but this does not appear to be the case for this patient.

Increasing the dose of omeprazole to twice daily may be an option, but the patient has already been taking omeprazole once daily without sufficient symptom relief.

Replacing omeprazole with nortriptyline is not appropriate in this case, as nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant used primarily for neuropathic pain or depression, not for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The correct answer is D: Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica.

Explanation:
Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica (AAE) is a rare disorder characterized by zinc deficiency. It typically presents with a periorificial and acral dermatitis, involving the hands, feet, and perianal area. The necrotizing anogenital ulcer seen in this case is consistent with AAE. The symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border is a characteristic finding in AAE. The neutrophil predominant perivascular and interstitial infiltrate seen on histopathology is also consistent with AAE. Laboratory findings of leukocytosis and thrombocytosis can be seen in zinc deficiency. Initial treatment consists of zinc supplementation, along with wound management and appropriate systemic antibiotics if infection is present.

The correct answer is D: Sarcoidosis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of polymorphic erythematous macules and plaques with elevated and indurated borders, along with the presence of a chronic dermic granulomatous process on histopathological analysis, is consistent with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can present with skin involvement, and the nonencapsulated granulomatous infiltrate with a perineural distribution seen in the biopsy specimen supports this diagnosis. Other systemic investigations, such as blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses, were normal, indicating that the dermatosis is likely localized rather than disseminated.

B: Linear porokeratosis

Explanation: Linear porokeratosis is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of linear hyperkeratotic papules or plaques that follow the lines of Blaschko. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence and remains stable over time. The lesions are caused by clonal expansion of atypical keratinocytes and are thought to arise from a postzygotic somatic mutation. The condition is usually sporadic, but rare cases of familial inheritance have been reported. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a skin biopsy, which typically shows the characteristic cornoid lamella.

The diagnosis is C: Orbital apex syndrome.

Explanation: Orbital apex syndrome is characterized by proptosis, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and visual loss. It is caused by lesions in the orbital apex, which is the region at the back of the eye socket where the optic nerve and other important structures pass through. The periorbital swelling, proptosis, and ophthalmoparesis seen in this case are consistent with orbital apex involvement. This syndrome can be caused by various conditions, including inflammation (such as orbital cellulitis), tumors, and vascular lesions, among others. However, in this case, the absence of pain and the normal optic nerve and retina findings make thyroid eye disease (A) and orbital cellulitis (D) less likely. Cavernous sinus syndrome (B) typically presents with additional symptoms such as cranial nerve palsies and involvement of the other structures adjacent to the cavernous sinus, which are not seen in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is orbital apex syndrome (C).
B

Answer: D: Bacterial endocarditis.

Explanation: The patient's history of recent cardiac procedure, fever, and neurologic abnormalities are highly concerning for infective endocarditis and septic emboli. The elevated white blood cell count and positive blood culture for Streptococcus mitis further support this diagnosis. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of diffusion restriction in the left-hemisphere watershed areas, perivenular and leptomeningeal enhancement, and cortical diffusion restriction not consistent with ischemic injury are consistent with septic emboli. The worsening on a second MRI suggests ongoing embolic events. Additionally, the patient's sudden hypotension, bradycardia, and the presence of ST-segment elevations on electrocardiogram are consistent with septic shock. The absence of vegetation on TEE does not rule out endocarditis as vegetations may not always be visualized.

B: Intermittent testicular torsion

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient presents with intermittent scrotal swelling and soreness, more prominent in the morning on waking. The physical examination shows a painful but tender right scrotal swelling. The swelling is not reducible, the right testicle is not palpable, and the transillumination test is nondiagnostic. This combination of symptoms and findings is suggestive of intermittent testicular torsion. Further evaluation and confirmation can be done through diagnostic imaging and surgical exploration.

B: Perform cerebral angiography

Explanation: The presentation of bilateral visual field loss in a young girl with a history of migraine headaches raises concern for a vascular etiology. The presence of subacute infarction on the brain MRI further supports this concern. Performing cerebral angiography can help identify any underlying vascular abnormalities or stenosis that may be contributing to the visual field loss. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate management and treatment options for the patient.

Answer: C: Follow up in 12 months to reexamine the lesion

Explanation: Since the patient's best-corrected visual acuity is normal and there are no other symptoms or abnormalities found, it is reasonable to closely monitor the lesion by scheduling a follow-up examination in 12 months. If there are any changes or progression in the lesion, further investigations or interventions can be considered at that time. Perform intravenous fluorescein angiography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain are not necessary at this point since there are no indications of any systemic or neurological issues. Requesting fundus examination of the family members is also unnecessary as there is no indication of any hereditary condition.

Answer: C: Search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination 

Explanation: The presentation of acute visual loss, central scotoma, delayed P100 response on visual evoked potential, and attenuated ellipsoid zone on optical coherence tomography (OCT) suggests a possible infectious etiology. Given the patient's recent travel to Ireland and horse riding activity, there may be a risk of exposure to zoonotic infection. The presence of 2 small glistening lesions on fundus photography and the possibility of nematode involvement suggest that a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination should be conducted to search for nematodes, which may explain the patient's symptoms. This step should be taken before considering other diagnostic options or initiating treatment.

The correct answer is D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

Explanation: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder that primarily affects young adult males but can also affect females. It is characterized by painless, subacute vision loss, typically starting in one eye and then progressing to involve the other eye within weeks to months. The visual loss is often severe, with central vision loss and cecocentral scotomas seen on visual field testing.

In this case, the patient's symptoms, including the pattern of visual field loss and optic nerve findings, are consistent with LHON. Additionally, the patient has a family history of vision loss, supporting a genetic etiology. Therefore, performing genetic testing for LHON would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. This can help confirm the diagnosis and provide important information for genetic counseling and potential future treatments.

D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

Explanation: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial disorder causing optic atrophy and vision loss. This patient's symptoms, including the onset of decreased vision, cecocentral scotoma, and optic nerve abnormalities, are consistent with LHON. Additionally, a family history of vision loss has been reported, which raises suspicion for an inherited condition such as LHON. Genetic testing for LHON should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management. Checking methylmalonic acid levels and repleting vitamin B12, repeating magnetic resonance imaging, and recommending lumbar puncture are not indicated based on the history and findings provided.

D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

Explanation: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial genetic disorder that primarily affects the optic nerves, leading to vision loss. It typically presents in young adulthood, but can occur in middle-aged individuals as well. LHON is characterized by bilateral, painless central vision loss with a cecocentral scotoma, which matches the patient's symptoms and visual field findings.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and the family history of vision loss attributed to optic neuritis from multiple sclerosis, genetic testing for LHON is warranted. This will help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management interventions. Other diagnostic tests, such as checking for elevated levels of methylmalonic acid and repleting vitamin B12, may be relevant in other conditions but are unlikely to be the cause of this patient's vision loss based on the given information. Repeating the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or recommending a lumbar puncture are not indicated at this time, as the initial MRI findings were normal and there are no other suggestive clinical features for alternative diagnoses.

D: Discontinue doxycycline.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with bilateral optic disc edema and elevated intracranial pressure suggests the possibility of pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Doxycycline, which the patient has been taking for the past 10 months for malaria prophylaxis, has been associated with the development of IIH in some cases. Discontinuing doxycycline should be the first step in managing this patient's condition. Other treatments for IIH, such as acetazolamide, may be considered if discontinuing doxycycline does not lead to resolution of the symptoms. However, there is no indication to start amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine or penicillin in this case.

D: Genetic testing.

Explanation: The patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and imaging results suggest that he has a complex set of congenital abnormalities involving multiple organ systems, including the eyes, aorta, central nervous system, and skeletal system. Given the wide range of abnormalities and the lack of a clear genetic or familial pattern, genetic testing would be the most appropriate next step to determine the underlying cause of these findings. Genetic testing may help identify specific genetic mutations or syndromes that could explain the patient's condition and guide further management and counseling for the patient and his family.

The answer is C: Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. 

Explanation: Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematological malignancy characterized by cutaneous involvement. It typically presents as infiltrative skin lesions, as seen in this case. BPDCN is derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), which are a type of immune cell involved in antigen presentation. On histopathological examination, BPDCN shows a monomorphous infiltrate of round to oval cells with open chromatin, inconspicuous to prominent nucleoli, and a small amount of cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining typically demonstrates positivity for markers such as CD4, CD56, TCL1, and CD123. 

Leukemia cutis (option A) is the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin, but the histopathological and immunohistochemical features described in this case do not support that diagnosis. 

Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (option B) is a neoplasm of T-cell origin that typically presents as solitary or localized skin lesions, rather than the infiltrative and disseminated lesions seen in this case. 

Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome (option D) are both types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but the clinical and histopathological features described in this case are more consistent with BPDCN.

A: Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with acute coronary syndrome, specifically anterior ST-segment elevations on the ECG and rising troponin levels, indicates an ongoing myocardial infarction. Urgent coronary angiography reveals thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 in the affected arteries. This indicates impaired blood flow but not complete occlusion.

The recommended next step is to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents to restore blood flow in the affected coronary arteries. PCI is the preferred treatment for acute coronary syndrome when feasible and has been shown to improve outcomes. Drug-eluting stents are used to prevent restenosis or the re-narrowing of the treated arteries.

PCI with bioresorbable vascular scaffolds is a potential option, but there is limited evidence supporting its use in acute coronary syndrome compared to drug-eluting stents. Therefore, drug-eluting stents are the preferred choice in this case.

Defer intervention and continue supportive management is not recommended given the high-risk features of the patient's presentation, including ongoing myocardial infarction.

Referring for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting surgery may be considered if PCI is not feasible or unsuccessful, but PCI with drug-eluting stents should be attempted first.

A: Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including chest pain, ST-segment elevation on ECG, elevated troponin levels, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 in the affected coronary arteries, suggests that she is experiencing an acute myocardial infarction. In this case, performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch would be the appropriate course of action. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that helps restore blood flow to the heart by widening narrowed or blocked arteries using stents. Drug-eluting stents release medication to prevent restenosis (re-narrowing of the artery) and have been shown to be more effective than bare metal stents in reducing the risk of repeat blockages.

Urgent coronary angiography revealed obstruction in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch. The recommended next step is to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents to restore blood flow and prevent further myocardial damage. PCI is the preferred treatment for ACS, and drug-eluting stents help to reduce the risk of restenosis.

The answer option is D: Rosai-Dorfman disease.

Explanation: Rosai-Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare benign disorder characterized by painless lymphadenopathy, predominantly involving cervical lymph nodes. It commonly presents in children and young adults and can cause bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, as seen in this case. The lymphadenopathy in Rosai-Dorfman disease is typically nontender, mobile, and without signs of inflammation.

The histopathological features of Rosai-Dorfman disease include increased histiocytes with emperipolesis, which is the engulfment of intact lymphocytes or plasma cells within the cytoplasm of histiocytes. Emperipolesis is a characteristic finding of this disorder and can be visualized using immunostains, such as CD-68, as shown in this case. Other stains, such as Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry, are typically negative in Rosai-Dorfman disease.

Infectious mononucleosis (Option A) typically presents with fever, sore throat, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Option B) is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal Langerhans cells and can involve various organs, not just lymph nodes. Reactive sinus histiocytosis (Option C) is characterized by sinus histiocytosis, but lacks the emperipolesis seen in Rosai-Dorfman disease.

The correct answer is C: Pleomorphic adenoma.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor, and it commonly presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the oral cavity, including the lip. Histologically, pleomorphic adenoma is characterized by the presence of ductal epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells, and mixed stroma. It is usually encapsulated and can be completely excised without rupture of the capsule, as in this case. The absence of recurrence and symptoms at the follow-up also supports the benign nature of the tumor. Mucocele usually presents as a fluctuant, bluish, or translucent mass caused by the rupture or obstruction of a salivary gland duct. Lipoma is a benign tumor composed of adipose tissue and typically presents as a soft, mobile mass. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the salivary glands and would show cytological atypia and invasive growth on histopathologic examination.

B: Discoid lupus erythematosus

Explanation: Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that mainly affects the skin. It is characterized by the presence of erythematous, scaling plaques that tend to be located on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, scalp, and ears. In this case, the erythematous plaque on the lower eyelid, along with the absence of eyelashes, is consistent with the clinical presentation of DLE. Dermoscopy findings, including an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and white scales, are also consistent with DLE. The histopathological analysis can further confirm the diagnosis of DLE.

Answer: B: Cutaneous silica granuloma

Explanation: 
Based on the patient's history of sustained injuries from a land mine explosion and the subsequent development of firm, erythematous nodules and small plaques in the affected areas, the likely diagnosis is cutaneous silica granuloma. Silica is a common component of land mines and can result in foreign body granulomas when it becomes embedded in the skin. The delayed onset of symptoms after the initial injury and the characteristic appearance of the lesions are consistent with this diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by non-caseating granulomas and typically presents with pulmonary involvement. Infectious granulomas would usually be accompanied by signs of infection, such as fever or constitutional symptoms. Keloids, while also characterized by raised scars, would not typically present as multiple papules, nodules, and plaques.

Answer: D: Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm

Explanation: The computed tomography (CT) image (Figure B) shows a large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma and a grade IV renal laceration with contrast-filled structure medial to the liver. Given the patient's history of blunt trauma and the presence of active extravasation in the initial CT scan, the most likely diagnosis is a rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms can occur as a complication of trauma and can result in ongoing bleeding. The presence of a large retroperitoneal hematoma supports this diagnosis. This patient may require further intervention, such as embolization or surgical management, to control the bleeding.

C: Do plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of decreased vision along with retinal findings such as venous dilatation, hemorrhages, hard exudates, and serous macular detachment is not consistent with the expected findings in diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, the patient has a low hemoglobin level and red blood cell count, indicating anemia. Given these findings, the next step would be to investigate the possibility of paraproteinemic maculopathy, which can present with similar retinal findings and is associated with hematologic disorders. Plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis are necessary to identify and characterize any paraprotein(s) that may be causing the maculopathy. Treatment will be directed at the underlying hematologic disorder once it is identified.

B: Discontinue cidofovir therapy, and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia.

Explanation: The patient presents with bilateral photophobia, blurry vision, and bilateral choroidal effusions on B-scan ultrasonography. These findings are consistent with drug-induced bilateral anterior uveitis, a rare adverse effect of cidofovir therapy. The best course of action is to discontinue cidofovir therapy, as it is causing nephrotoxicity, and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia to control the inflammation and relieve symptoms. Restarting cidofovir therapy would not be appropriate as it is causing adverse effects. Administering bilateral subtenon corticosteroid injections or beginning treatment with oral prednisone may be considered in severe cases or if topical therapy is inadequate, but it is not the initial treatment of choice.

A: Obtain a fluorescein angiogram

Explanation: Given the patient's history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and the presence of optic nerve head edema, nerve fiber layer infarctions, dot and blot hemorrhages, and macular edema, obtaining a fluorescein angiogram would help to further evaluate the retinal blood vessels and assess for any neovascularization or leakage. This test can provide important information about the extent of the retinopathy and guide further management decisions. The other options, such as determining blood glucose levels, performing a glycated hemoglobin test, and measuring heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, may also be important in the overall evaluation of the patient, but obtaining a fluorescein angiogram would provide more specific information regarding the retinopathy. Immediate computed tomography of the head is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and findings.

I would choose answer option D: Optic nerve sheath biopsy and radiotherapy.

Explanation: Given the progressive vision loss, optic nerve atrophy, thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, bilateral central scotomas, and the new findings of thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths on MRI, it is indicative of an underlying optic nerve pathology. The next step in the diagnostic workup would be to perform an optic nerve sheath biopsy to obtain tissue for histopathological examination. This would help determine the underlying cause of the optic nerve involvement.

Additionally, radiotherapy (fractionated external beam radiotherapy) can be considered in cases of optic nerve sheath meningioma, which is a possible differential diagnosis based on the imaging findings. Radiotherapy can be effective in reducing the size of the tumor and preserving visual function.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an optic nerve sheath biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis, followed by radiotherapy if the diagnosis is consistent with optic nerve sheath meningioma.

The correct diagnosis is D: Angiofibromas.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of numerous grouped 1-mm skin-colored monomorphic noninflammatory papules on the temples, cheeks, and chin is consistent with angiofibromas. These papules can occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or sporadically without any associated syndromes. In this case, the patient has no known health problems or history of significant skin disorders, making sporadic angiofibromas the most likely diagnosis.

The histopathologic examination of a representative lesion on the right chin (Figure B and C) would show a dermal proliferation of blood vessels and hair follicles with thickened collagen bundles consistent with angiofibroma. This histological pattern differs from other options such as lichen planopilaris, trichoepitheliomas, or miliary osteoma cutis.

Additionally, the patient's facial papules did not improve with hydroxychloroquine, which is commonly used to treat LPP but not angiofibromas.

The answer is C: Pemphigus vegetans.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with intertriginous condyloma-like plaques and ulcers, as well as histopathological examination showing acanthosis and intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses (Figure C and D), is consistent with pemphigus vegetans. Pemphigus vegetans is a subset of pemphigus vulgaris characterized by verrucous, vegetative plaques and pustules in intertriginous areas. In this case, the plaques are mistaken for condyloma acuminata due to their exophytic appearance. The patient's history of failed surgical treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa, the lack of clinical improvement with adalimumab, and the exacerbation of her condition with recurrent cellulitis further support the diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans rather than hidradenitis suppurativa. Metastatic Crohn disease can present with cutaneous lesions, but the clinical presentation and histopathological findings of pemphigus vegetans are more consistent with the current case. Linear hypertrophic herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection typically presents with grouped vesicles along a dermatome, and the histopathological findings in this case are not consistent with HSV infection.

717
B: Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis

Explanation: Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of Langerhans cells in various organs. In this case, the patient presented with nonhealing crusted scalp lesions, osteolytic skull lesions, and a subepidermal infiltrate consisting of large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, solitary lymphocytes, and eosinophilic granulocytes, which are characteristic findings of LCH. Immunohistochemical staining for CD1A, a marker for Langerhans cells, was positive. The patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings are consistent with multisystem LCH. The other answer options, including seborrheic dermatitis, crusted scabies, and psoriasis vulgaris, do not fit the clinical picture and histopathological findings described in the case.

D: Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury.

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests that the self-injurious behavior, irritability, and agitation are significant challenges that need to be addressed. Referral to a behavioral intervention program can provide comprehensive support and strategies to manage these behaviors. Aripiprazole, an antipsychotic medication, has evidence for the treatment of irritability and aggression in autistic children and can be considered as an adjunctive pharmacotherapy option in this case.

719
B: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system

Explanation: 
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). PACNS is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the central nervous system, leading to recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The patient's history of recurrent strokes, as well as the presence of multiple infarcts, hemorrhages, and granulomatous lesions on brain MRI, are consistent with PACNS.

Other options can be ruled out based on the available information:
- A: COL4A1 gene mutation: This is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the kidneys and eyes. It is unlikely to be the cause of the recurrent strokes and other neurological manifestations observed in this case.
- C: Polyarteritis nodosa: This systemic vasculitis primarily affects medium-sized arteries, and the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case are not consistent with polyarteritis nodosa.
- D: Neurotuberculosis: Although the patient had a positive Mantoux test, the negative CSF adenosine deaminase level and mycobacterial cultures make neurotuberculosis an unlikely diagnosis. Additionally, the clinical presentation and imaging findings are not typical of neurotuberculosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS).

My diagnosis is B: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system.

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, along with the presence of nodular granulomatous lesions on brain MRI, suggests a vascular disease affecting the central nervous system. The normal results of head and neck MR angiography and cerebral angiography make large-vessel diseases less likely. The absence of systemic symptoms, normal blood tests, and negative tuberculosis tests make options C and D less likely. The presence of erythema nodosum and skin biopsy findings are consistent with vasculitis. Additionally, the multiple brain lesions seen on MRI, along with the microscopic bleeding (microbleeds) and periventricular white matter lesions, are findings commonly associated with primary angiitis of the central nervous system. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary angiitis of the central nervous system.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
The correct answer is A: COL4A1 gene mutation.

Explanation:
This patient's history of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, as well as the presence of granulomatous lesions and cerebral microbleeds, suggests a genetic cause. COL4A1 gene mutations are associated with cerebral small vessel disease and have been found in patients with a similar clinical presentation. The presence of skin lesions such as erythema nodosum further supports the diagnosis of COL4A1 gene mutation, as skin manifestations are common in these patients. Other possible diagnoses, such as primary angiitis of the central nervous system, polyarteritis nodosa, and neurotuberculosis, are less likely based on the given clinical features and test results.

The correct answer is D: Juvenile plantar dermatosis.

Explanation:
Juvenile plantar dermatosis is a common skin condition seen in adolescents, characterized by dry, scaly, and fissured skin on the soles of the feet, particularly the weight-bearing areas. It is more common in warm weather and worsens with prolonged exposure to moisture, friction, and sweat. The condition is usually asymptomatic or may present with mild pruritus. Unlike tinea pedis, there is no involvement of the interdigital spaces or positive fungal smear test. Psoriasis typically involves other parts of the body and presents with well-defined, erythematous plaques with silvery scales. Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by generalized reddish-orange scaly plaques, palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratosis. None of these findings are present in this case.

B: Testicular cancer

Explanation: The presence of a large abdominal mass, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels, as well as the absence of the left testis and the presence of lymphadenopathy in various regions, strongly suggest a diagnosis of testicular cancer. Testicular cancer often metastasizes to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which can manifest as an abdominal mass. The elevated levels of β human chorionic gonadotrophin also support this diagnosis, as it is a tumor marker commonly associated with testicular cancer.

The diagnosis in this case is D: Duodenal injury.

Explanation:
The patient's history of abdominal trauma caused by the bicycle handlebar, along with the physical examination findings of paraumbilical ecchymosis, abdominal tenderness, and distension, suggests possible abdominal organ injury.
The abdominal CT scan shows a pneumoperitoneum (presence of air in the peritoneal cavity) and free fluid in the lower quadrants of the abdomen, which are consistent with a duodenal injury.
Other diagnoses can be ruled out based on the patient's history and CT findings. Pancreas injury may present with similar symptoms but typically presents with different physical examination findings and may show abnormal pancreatic enzymes on laboratory tests. Flaring ulcerative colitis would not typically cause a pneumoperitoneum or free fluid in the abdomen. Rectosigmoid junction rupture is less likely in this case as there is no mention of signs such as rectal bleeding or change in bowel movements.
C
cellvalue empty
723
C: Laboratory workup for uveitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with chronic conjunctivitis, blurry vision, vitritis, and diffuse hypofluorescent retinal dots on fluorescein angiography is indicative of uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. In this case, the presence of vitritis, retinal dots, and segmental vessel staining on fluorescein angiography suggest an underlying inflammatory process.

Performing a laboratory workup for uveitis is necessary to identify the cause of the inflammation. This workup typically includes serological testing for infectious causes such as syphilis, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease. Additionally, autoimmune and systemic inflammatory conditions such as sarcoidosis and Behcet's disease should be considered and appropriate testing ordered.

Based on the findings of the laboratory workup, a more specific treatment plan can be developed. This may involve immunosuppressive therapy, targeted antimicrobial treatment, or a combination approach depending on the underlying etiology.

B: Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment

Explanation: The patient's presentation of sudden-onset, painless vision loss in the right eye, along with the findings of large pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) with associated tears and scrolling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on optical coherence tomography, suggest a diagnosis of retinal pigment epithelium tears. The presence of window defects with hyperfluorescence on intravenous fluorescein angiography also supports this diagnosis.

Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, such as ranibizumab or bevacizumab, is the recommended treatment for retinal pigment epithelium tears. These medications help to reduce the leakage of fluid and blood in the retina, improving vision and preventing further damage.

The option to refer the patient to the nephrologist for evaluation of kidney function is not necessary at this point, as the patient's kidney transplant and its function are unrelated to the retinal condition.

Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is not the standard treatment for retinal pigment epithelium tears. This therapy is typically used for other ocular conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration.

Therefore, the best course of action at this point would be to administer intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment.

B: Order urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of acute binocular horizontal diplopia and disorientation, along with the presence of swollen, hyperemic optic discs and choroidal lesions, there is concern for involvement of the central nervous system. Ordering an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can help to evaluate for any possible intracranial pathology, such as inflammation or infection, that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This will provide valuable information for further diagnosis and management.

Answer: B: Superficial corneal biopsy

Explanation: The presence of bilateral corneal deposits in a patient receiving oral prednisone therapy raises concern for medication-induced corneal deposits. To confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the deposits, a superficial corneal biopsy should be performed. This will allow for histological examination of the deposits and potentially guide further management. Initiation of topical prednisolone therapy or topical fortified vancomycin therapy would not be appropriate in this case since the cause of the corneal deposits is unknown. Penetrating keratoplasty may be considered in cases of severe visual impairment or if conservative management is unsuccessful, but it would be premature to proceed with this option without confirming the diagnosis first.

The answer is B: Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA).

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a large lobulated mass in the left lower lobe of the lung, along with the immunohistochemical profile (CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, napsin A negative) supports the diagnosis of pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA). PEA is a subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that has histologic and immunophenotypic similarities to colorectal adenocarcinoma. The negative results of testing for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 gene mutations, as well as the absence of involvement in the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon, rule out metastatic colorectal cancer. The absence of large vessel or perineural invasion and negative lymph nodes also make lymphoma less likely. Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary is a possibility, but the immunohistochemical profile is more consistent with PEA.

C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of palpitations, atrial flutter, and the findings on the 12-lead electrocardiogram (marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads) suggest the possibility of right ventricular hypertrophy or dilation. A right-sided precordial lead electrocardiogram can help confirm this diagnosis and provide further information about the electrical activity of the right side of the heart. This will help guide management decisions and potential treatment options for the patient. Obtaining high-sensitivity troponin I level, D-dimer level, or ventilation/perfusion lung scan is not indicated based on the clinical presentation and electrocardiographic findings described.

C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads

Explanation: The patient's 12-lead electrocardiogram shows marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads. This suggests the possibility of right ventricular hypertrophy or enlargement, which could be a result of the long-standing atrial flutter and bronchiectasis. Obtaining an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads, such as V4R and V5R, can help further evaluate the right ventricular involvement. This will provide more information about the patient's cardiac status and potentially guide appropriate management decisions.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads 

Explanation: The patient's presentation and ECG findings are suggestive of right ventricular strain or hypertrophy. To further evaluate the right ventricle, obtaining an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads (V3R to V6R) would be the most appropriate next step. This can help assess for any right ventricular infarction or dysfunction, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms of palpitations. The other options, such as obtaining high-sensitivity troponin I level, D-dimer level, or ventilation/perfusion lung scan, are less likely to provide immediate insight into the patient's palpitations and ECG findings in this case.

C: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

Explanation: The imaging and histopathologic findings described in the case are consistent with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from primitive cells of skeletal muscle lineage. It typically presents as a soft tissue mass in children and young adults. In this case, the imaging findings reveal a large infiltrative mass involving the sinonasal region with extensive local and regional extension. The histopathologic features of nests of primitive small round blue cells surrounded by fibrovascular septa, along with the immunohistochemical staining profile, including diffuse positivity for desmin, myogenin, and CD56, are characteristic of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Other entities in the differential diagnosis, such as esthesioneuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, can be ruled out based on the absence of specific immunohistochemical markers and the typical histopathologic features seen in this case.
C
732
The correct answer is C: Amyloidosis.

Explanation: Amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins called amyloid fibrils in various tissues and organs throughout the body. In this case, the patient presented with a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing punctate calcifications centered on the epiglottis, which caused significant narrowing of the oropharyngeal and supraglottic airways. This is consistent with the findings seen in amyloidosis, where amyloid deposits can lead to local tissue infiltration and subsequent narrowing of airways.

Other clinical findings, such as splenomegaly, ascites, and laboratory abnormalities including elevated serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria levels, also support the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Echocardiography findings of right atrial and ventricular dilatation and increased thickness of the interventricular septum are also commonly seen in cardiac amyloidosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (option A) and rhabdomyosarcoma (option D) are both malignancies that can occur in the head and neck region, but the clinical and imaging findings in this case are not consistent with these diagnoses. Lymphoma (option B) is a consideration given the patient's history of splenomegaly and other laboratory abnormalities, but the imaging findings are not suggestive of lymphoma in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis (option C).
C
733
My diagnosis for this case is: D: Aberrant internal carotid artery.

Explanation: The imaging findings on the computed tomographic (CT) temporal bone scan show arrowheads indicating the presence of an aberrant internal carotid artery. This abnormality can cause pulsatile tinnitus by compressing adjacent structures in the middle ear, leading to the whooshing sound and exacerbation of symptoms with certain head movements. The patient's symptoms, including the presence of pulsatile tinnitus, the relief of symptoms with compression of the right side of the neck, and the absence of other relevant medical history or findings, are consistent with this diagnosis.
C
734
Letter D: Perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The MRI findings show an elongated tubular mass along the lateral surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, extending posteriorly and deep to it. This presentation is consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's history of a previous skin cancer excised from the right ear further supports this possibility. The symptoms of electric and stabbing pain are also typical of perineural invasion.
D
735
Based on the information provided, the best next step would be to choose option C: Prescribe a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with intertrigo, which is a common inflammatory skin condition occurring in body folds. It typically occurs due to friction, heat, and maceration in these areas. The irregularly thickened skin, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, acrochordons (skin tags), malodorous crust, areas of maceration, and erosion seen in the right axilla and right lateral area of the neck are consistent with this diagnosis.

Since emollients were unhelpful, the next step would be to prescribe a topical corticosteroid (to reduce inflammation and itching) and a topical antimicrobial agent (to control superinfection). This combination therapy can help to improve symptoms and prevent secondary infections.

Option A: Prescribing topical ketoconazole is not the best choice in this case. Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication, but there is no indication or suggestion of a fungal infection in the presented case.

Option B: Obtaining glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level is not necessary at this point. The patient's weight and family history of diabetes do not necessarily indicate that diabetes mellitus is the cause of the rash. The presentation is more consistent with intertrigo due to the friction and heat in the affected areas.

Option D: Consulting for surgical excision is not indicated in this case. Intertrigo can be effectively managed with topical therapy, and surgical excision is not typically necessary.

B: Cellulitis and abscess associated with neonatal group B streptococcal infection

Explanation: The description of the trenchlike ulcer on the newborn's scalp, along with the presence of serosanguineous crust and the absence of infection signs (such as tenderness and drainage), suggests an underlying cellulitis and abscess. This is further supported by the baby's elevated serum bilirubin levels, indicative of an infection. Group B streptococcal infection is a common cause of cellulitis and abscess in neonates.

The correct answer is B: Pancreatic panniculitis.

Explanation: Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare complication of pancreatitis and is characterized by tender nodules on the lower legs. The nodules are pink to purple in color and can be associated with underlying fat necrosis. Histopathology typically shows inflammation, fibrosis, and fat necrosis in the subcutaneous tissue. In this case, the patient has a history of pancreatitis and the biopsy findings are consistent with pancreatic panniculitis.

A: Lichen amyloidosis

Explanation: The patient's presentation of hypopigmented, atrophic, and folliculocentric papules on the trunk, along with the clinical history and findings on dermoscopy, are consistent with lichen amyloidosis. Lichen amyloidosis is a rare skin disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the papillary dermis. It typically presents as multiple flat-topped papules that are usually hypopigmented and can be pruritic. The lesions are often limited to the trunk and may be arranged in a linear or grouped pattern. Dermoscopy may show central keratin plugs and areas of homogenous, whitish color with surrounding erythema. Histopathologic examination reveals amorphous eosinophilic deposits in the papillary dermis. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and cryotherapy.

The most likely diagnosis for this case is B: Branchio-oto-renal syndrome.

Explanation: Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is characterized by the presence of branchial cleft fistulas or cysts, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. The preauricular sinus and ear pit, as well as the presence of small kidneys, are consistent with this syndrome. The pedunculated skin-colored papule on the lateral neck may be a branchial cleft cyst that is draining clear fluid when the patient eats. This syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and can be associated with other manifestations such as auricular and vertebral anomalies.

B: Hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis

Explanation: The patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and evidence of bleeding on CT scan (blush of contrast within the lumen of the gallbladder and surrounding hyperemia of the liver) is consistent with hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis. The presence of gallstones and intraperitoneal fluid supports this diagnosis. The patient's coagulopathy indicated by an elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR), lowered hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated lactate level could be attributed to the bleeding. There are no findings to suggest anaphylaxis, spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage, or septic shock in this case.

A: Normal coronary angiography

Explanation: The question provides a history of the patient's previously treated atherosclerotic disease, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and drug-eluting stent placement. However, the question does not provide any specific findings or evidence of progression or complications related to the atherosclerotic disease. The description of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings (diminished left radial pulse) are more suggestive of other conditions such as subclavian steal syndrome or subclavian stenosis, but the given angiography does not show any significant arterial blockages or steal phenomena. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Normal coronary angiography.

B: Pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation and findings, particularly the presence of subretinal fluid, retinal pigment epithelial alterations, and choroidal thickening, a pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid is the most appropriate next step. This procedure can help alleviate the symptoms and potentially improve visual acuity by removing the fluid and relieving the pressure on the retina. It is important to address the subretinal fluid before considering other treatment options such as choroidal biopsy, plasmapheresis, or radiotherapy.

743
I would choose option C: Perform excisional biopsy.
Explanation: Given the duration of the lesion and the lack of improvement with topical antibiotics and oral sulindac, it is important to consider performing a biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis. The characteristics of the lesion, such as its firmness, nonvascularity, and lack of response to incision and drainage, suggest the possibility of a solid lesion rather than an infectious process. Additionally, the positive culture for Propionibacterium acnes may be an incidental finding. Performing an excisional biopsy will allow for histopathological examination of the lesion, which will help determine the underlying cause and guide further management. Other options such as initiating oral colchicine therapy or performing intralesional dexamethasone injection would require a confirmed diagnosis and may not be appropriate as first-line treatments without further information. Observing with serial examinations may delay definitive diagnosis and treatment if the lesion worsens or persists.

B: Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy again

Explanation: In this case, the patient is presenting with persistent angiographic abnormalities after a previous intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The angiography shows significant peripheral retinal avascularity and arteriovenous anastomoses. Since there is no evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrence of ROP, the most appropriate next step would be to administer intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy again to address the persistent abnormalities and promote vascularization in the peripheral retina.

D: Perform hypercoagulability workup.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of recurrent, transient vision loss and the presence of an enhancing right orbital mass, further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. Hypercoagulability can cause vascular compromise and lead to transient vision loss, making it a possible factor in this case. Therefore, performing a hypercoagulability workup, which may include testing for conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, and other coagulation disorders, would help to determine if hypercoagulability is contributing to the patient's symptoms and guide appropriate management.

B: Genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of restricted movements of the left eye since birth, coupled with the enlarged extraocular muscles seen on MRI, the most appropriate next step would be genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM). CFEOM is a condition characterized by restrictive strabismus, which is the inability to move the eyes properly due to abnormalities in the extraocular muscles. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis and identify any specific genetic mutations associated with CFEOM. This information can be crucial in planning appropriate management and treatment strategies for the patient.

B: Perform another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection

Explanation: In this case, the patient has a history of chronic inflammation in the left eye following YAG capsulotomy. The initial vitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotics did not completely resolve the inflammation, and subsequent cultures revealed Propionibacterium acnes, suggesting a possible infection. Therefore, it would be appropriate to perform another vitreous tap to further investigate and confirm the presence of the bacterium and administer intravitreal vancomycin to target the infection. This approach allows for targeted treatment while minimizing systemic side effects.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is C: Mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, characterized by the gradual onset of itchy, erythematous patches and plaques on the skin. It typically affects adults and can progress to more advanced stages, such as tumor formation and systemic involvement. The biopsy results showing dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism are consistent with the suspected diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. The negative T cell receptor γ gene rearrangement analysis also supports this diagnosis as it helps rule out other T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.

I would choose option A: Manage the patient medically and perform repeated transthoracic echocardiography in 6 months.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the patient's symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea are likely related to sinus tachycardia, which was observed during the episodes of palpitation on event monitoring. The physical examination and laboratory test results are within normal limits. The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm and early repolarization changes, which are commonly seen in healthy individuals. The echocardiogram reveals a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and a normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Given the absence of any significant abnormalities on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, there is no immediate need for intervention or surgery. Instead, it is appropriate to manage the patient medically, meaning to provide supportive care and monitor their condition. Repeating the transthoracic echocardiography in 6 months will help assess any potential changes or progression of any underlying cardiac condition.

The correct answer is B: Salivary gland anlage tumor.

Explanation: The patient presented with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, gasping and apneic episodes at night, and nighttime nasal congestion. During the adenoidectomy surgery, a nasopharyngeal mass was discovered, and further evaluation confirmed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left nasopharynx. The final pathology results showed keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma, which is consistent with a salivary gland anlage tumor. This type of tumor originates from remnants of embryonic salivary gland tissue and is typically benign.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis in this case is D: Unusual mucocele.

Explanation: A mucocele is a common benign cyst that occurs when a minor salivary gland duct becomes blocked or damaged, leading to the accumulation of saliva in the surrounding tissues. It typically presents as a painless, fluid-filled swelling. However, in this case, the swelling is described as hard, which is atypical for a mucocele. Nonetheless, the recent history of biting the cheek and the increasing pain and swelling are consistent with a mucocele. The presence of bleeding with palpation further supports this diagnosis. While other options such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sialolith, and intraoral lipoma may also cause swelling of the inner cheek, they are less likely given the clinical presentation provided.
B
752
I would choose answer option A: Submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of a painful submandibular mass, the imaging findings of a well-defined mass adjacent to the left submandibular gland, and the histopathologic findings of a spindle cell neoplasm positive for S100 immunohistochemical stain, the most likely diagnosis is a submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign salivary gland tumors, and the S100 immunohistochemical stain is typically positive in these tumors. The negative staining for smooth muscle actin, CD34, and pankeratin further supports this diagnosis. Chronic lymphadenitis, hypoglossal nerve schwannoma, and chronic submandibular sialadenitis are less likely given the clinical presentation and findings.
C
753
The correct answer is C: Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.

Explanation: The key findings in this case are the presence of a cutaneous mass in the supraclavicular area, islands of large epithelioid cells with increased mitotic index, a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, expression of p16 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), absence of expression for markers associated with other types of tumors, and negative EBV in situ hybridization. These features are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, which is a rare variant of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. It is commonly seen in the nasopharynx but can rarely occur outside of this location. In this case, the lack of a primary head or neck neoplasm, negative lymph nodes, and identification of an intestinal tumor as the primary source of metastasis further support the diagnosis of a metastatic lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.
C
754
Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's persistent symptoms despite taking proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy suggest that the acid suppressive medication is not adequately controlling her symptoms. Increasing the dose of esomeprazole to 40 mg twice daily may provide better acid suppression and symptom relief. This is a reasonable step before considering other options such as antireflux surgery or switching to alternative medications.
B: Obtain a biopsy of the nodule.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of ovarian cancer and the appearance of the peristomal nodule, obtaining a biopsy is the most appropriate next step. This will help to determine the underlying cause of the nodule and guide further management. Cultures may be considered if infection is suspected, but a biopsy will provide more diagnostic information. Consultation with wound care for barrier protection may be necessary in the management of the ostomy site, but it does not address the underlying nodule. Prescribing topical steroids may be considered if there is evidence of inflammation or dermatitis, but a biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis before initiating treatment.
B

756
D: Secondary syphilis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of erythematous annular patches, particularly on the trunk, and the absence of scaling, hypopigmentation, induration, or atrophy is consistent with secondary syphilis. The histopathologic findings of superficial lymphocytic infiltrates in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis, along with vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction and lymphocytic exocytosis, further support this diagnosis. The negative serologic testing for syphilis suggests that the patient may be in the early stages of secondary syphilis, where serological tests may not yet be positive. Proper treatment with antibiotics is essential.

757
B: Erythema nodosum

Explanation: Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis characterized by tender, erythematous nodules that typically occur on the anterior surface of the lower legs. It is often associated with systemic diseases such as infections (e.g., streptococcal, tuberculosis), drugs, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The characteristic nodules are deep dermal/subcutaneous and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and arthritis. The diagnosis is usually clinical and can be confirmed by skin biopsy if needed. Wound cultures being negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi further support the diagnosis of erythema nodosum in this case.
C

758
The correct answer is A: Erythema ab igne.

Explanation: Erythema ab igne is a condition characterized by a reticulated, hyperpigmented eruption on the skin caused by chronic exposure to repeated, low-grade heat. It typically occurs on the back and is associated with the use of heating pads, hot water bottles, or other sources of external heat. The skin changes in erythema ab igne are often described as a "toasted" appearance, with a net-like or reticulated pattern of light brown macules and patches. Histopathologic examination may show features of spongiotic dermatitis, interface dermatitis, dyskeratosis, and dermal melanophages. In this case, the patient's history of recurrent, pruritic eruptions involving the middle and lower back, along with the characteristic clinical and histopathologic findings, are consistent with a diagnosis of erythema ab igne.
B
cellvalue empty
759
C: Germinoma

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is a germinoma. Germinomas are germ cell tumors that primarily occur in the central nervous system. They are typically found in the pineal gland or the suprasellar region, but can also arise in other locations, including the basal ganglia.

In this case, the patient presented with cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and progressive weakness of the left arm and leg. The initial MRI revealed a suspicious lesion in the right basal ganglia, which showed progression and enlargement over time. Additionally, there was no family history of tumors or abnormalities in pituitary function.

Germinomas are often characterized by slow progression and can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, depending on the location of the tumor. In this case, the tumor involving the basal ganglia resulted in neurological deficits such as weakness and sensory changes on the left side of the body.

The absence of abnormalities in carotid and intracranial angiography and normal human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) further support the diagnosis of a germinoma.

Other differential diagnoses, such as glioma, infarction, and demyelination, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case.

760
The correct answer is B: Waardenburg syndrome type 1.

Explanation: Waardenburg syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by various physical features, including lateral displacement of the inner canthi of the eyes (dystopia canthorum), broad nasal root, small nostrils, and medial eyebrow flare. It can also affect the pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eyes, leading to hypopigmented patches and bright blue eyes, as seen in the father's case. Waardenburg syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the condition on to each of their children. However, in some cases, it can also occur sporadically as a result of a new mutation. Stickler syndrome (A) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by ocular, hearing, and skeletal abnormalities. X-linked Alport syndrome (C) is a hereditary kidney disease that can cause hearing loss and eye abnormalities. Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation (D) refers to a specific genetic mutation associated with non-syndromic hearing loss but does not explain the other midfacial features observed in this case.
B

761
B: Conversion to Crohn disease

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including a history of UC, presence of abdominal pain, and absence of hematochezia or melena, raises suspicion for a complication of UC. The computed tomographic scan showed a thickened colon and an intramural abscess, suggesting active inflammation. The repeated scan showed progression of the intramural mass, partially obstructing the descending colon. Colonoscopy demonstrated multiple areas of inflammation in the rectum through the descending colon. This presentation is consistent with a conversion from UC to Crohn disease, which can occur in a subset of patients with UC. The inability to visualize the colon proximal to the midtransverse colon due to a large fecal burden is also consistent with Crohn disease, which commonly involves the terminal ileum.

762
B: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy.

Explanation: The presence of white subretinal lesions, associated hemorrhages, and vitritis in the patient's left eye is concerning for intraocular infection. Given the patient's neutropenia and persistent fevers, it is important to rule out infectious causes. Performing a pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy allows for the collection of vitreous and subretinal fluid for culture and histopathological analysis, which can help identify the causative organism and guide appropriate treatment. This procedure will provide diagnostic information and guide further management.
B

763
D: Repair canalicular lacerations and perform an orbitotomy for FB removal

Explanation: The patient in this case has suffered a gunshot injury to the right orbit resulting in a foreign body (bullet) lodged in the orbit. The patient also has lacerations involving the canaliculi, which are the drainage channels for tears. In this situation, repair of the canalicular lacerations is necessary to prevent tearing and maintain proper drainage of tears.

Additionally, given the presence of symptoms such as pain and deficits in eye movements, and findings such as vitreous hemorrhage and subretinal hemorrhage, further evaluation with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study is warranted. This will help in better understanding the extent of soft tissue injury caused by the bullet and guide the surgical planning.

However, leaving the foreign body in place is not recommended as it can lead to complications such as infection, chronic inflammation, and damage to surrounding structures. Therefore, it is necessary to perform an orbitotomy to remove the foreign body and ensure proper healing and recovery.

764
C: Review medical and family history for hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases.

Explanation: Given the presentation of acute monocular vision loss with venous tortuosity and dilation, disc edema, intraretinal hemorrhages, and nerve fiber layer infarcts, it is important to consider underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to these retinal findings. Hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases, such as clotting disorders or autoimmune conditions, can lead to retinal vein occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy. Reviewing the patient's medical and family history can help identify any risk factors or underlying conditions that need to be addressed. Options A, B, and D involve treatment interventions that are not appropriate at this stage without further investigation of the underlying cause.
C
cellvalue empty
765
C: Initiate rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapy

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient, including the history of tobacco use and alcohol dependence, along with constitutional symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and cough, raises suspicion for ocular involvement of systemic tuberculosis (TB). The positive interferon γ release assay (QuantiFERON-TB Gold) supports the diagnosis of latent TB infection. In addition, the presence of small pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography further supports the likelihood of TB as the underlying cause. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to initiate RIPE therapy, which consists of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, to treat the systemic TB infection. It is important to start treatment promptly to prevent further ocular and systemic complications. Alternative answer options (A, B, D) are not indicated in this case.
C

766
The answer is D: Advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor.

Explanation: The patient presented with vague abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, and abdominal distension, which are nonspecific symptoms. The physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with a palpable left abdominal mass and a firm right spermatic cord nodule. Laboratory tests showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. CT imaging revealed innumerable masses throughout the abdomen and pelvis, with the largest measuring 17.5 × 14 × 14 cm, a small enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe, and a small amount of ascites. Testicular sonogram revealed a right epididymal cyst. The histologic examination of the dominant left abdominal mass revealed neoplastic cells positive for cytokeratin and desmin, but negative for S100. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was positive for EWS-WT1 rearrangement. These findings are consistent with an advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor, a rare and aggressive malignancy that predominantly affects young males.

767
B: Implant a device to determine frequency of ventricular tachycardia.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of palpitations, breathlessness, chest pain, and episodes of light-headedness, along with the family history of sudden cardiac death, it is important to evaluate for possible ventricular tachycardia (VT). Implanting a device, such as an implantable loop recorder or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), would allow for continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and help determine the frequency and duration of any VT episodes. This would provide valuable information to guide further management and treatment decisions.
C
cellvalue empty
768
The correct answer is D: Cervical lymphatic malformation.

Explanation: The clinical history, physical examination findings, and imaging characteristics suggest a cervical lymphatic malformation. The patient presented with a giant left-sided neck mass without a history of trauma or infection. The mass was causing symptoms such as dyspnea and limitation of neck movements. The MRI revealed a cystic mass with fibrous septae and extension to the supraclavicular region, but no signs of invasion. The differential diagnosis includes branchial cleft cyst, glomus tumor, and liposarcoma, but the imaging findings and presentation are more consistent with a cervical lymphatic malformation. Surgical excision of the mass was performed, with preservation of the vital structures of the neck.
D
769
Answer: C: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis

Explanation: The patient presented with nasopharyngeal soft-tissue swelling and mucopurulent secretions on the left side, accompanied by symptoms ofthroat pain and swelling, snoring, and nasal obstruction. The computed tomographic scan with contrast revealed a hypodense collection extending from the left nasopharynx to the right palatine tonsil. Intraoperative endoscopy revealed ulceration and necrotic debris in the nasopharynx and oropharynx. These findings are suggestive of acute invasive fungal sinusitis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection in immunocompromised individuals.
B
770
Based on the given case presentation and the computed tomographic (CT) examination of the craniofacial skeleton, the most likely diagnosis is:

C: Fibrous dysplasia

Explanation: Fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and immature woven bone. It often presents in childhood or adolescence with slowly growing masses in the bones of the craniofacial skeleton. The lesions may cause facial deformities, like the exophthalmos and dental malocclusion seen in this case. The serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, thyroid, and parathyroid hormone levels were within normal limits, ruling out other conditions such as Paget disease of bone or endocrinopathy. Gardner syndrome typically involves multiple bones and is associated with gastrointestinal polyps, which are not mentioned in this case. Florid osseous dysplasia is a more localized condition that primarily affects the jaws and is not likely to cause the wide-ranging craniofacial involvement seen in this patient.
C
771
The answer is B: Liposarcoma, conventional myxoid variant.

Explanation: In this case, the key findings include left facial and eye pain with intermittent diplopia on upward and lateral gaze, left abducens nerve palsy, and an afferent pupillary defect. Imaging studies showed a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass extending into the orbital apex with smooth, nonaggressive bony remodeling and expansion of the left superior orbital fissure, as well as lateral displacement and compression of the left optic nerve. These findings are consistent with a tumor involving the orbit.

The histologic sections of the lesion showed features consistent with a liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from adipose tissue and can occur in any part of the body, including the orbit. The conventional myxoid variant of liposarcoma is characterized by a mixture of lipoblasts and myxoid stroma. The absence of the FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene indicated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) makes it less likely to be a lipoblastoma or a pleomorphic myxoid variant of liposarcoma. Teratomas consist of multiple germ cell layers but are less likely in this case due to the imaging findings and clinical presentation.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Liposarcoma, conventional myxoid variant.
C
772
C: Perform tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms

Explanation: Given the patient's history of partial nail loss, pain, and intermittent drainage, it is important to rule out any potential bacterial or fungal infection. Performing tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms will help identify the specific organism causing the infection, if present, and guide appropriate treatment options. Cryotherapy or immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen would not address the potential infection, and providing reassurance without further investigation may not be appropriate in this case.
B
cellvalue empty
773
Answer: B

Explanation: The patient in this case has developed thrombocytopenia following heparin therapy, which is suggestive of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The significant drop in platelet count from 250,000/mm3 on postoperative day 1 to 83,000/mm3 on postoperative day 2 is an important clue. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition that can lead to new thrombosis, such as the left femoral vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism observed in this patient. Therefore, it is important to discontinue heparin immediately and initiate an alternative anticoagulant, such as argatroban, to prevent further thrombotic complications.
D: Cutaneous diphtheria

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a painful nonhealing ulcer with yellowish sloughing on the foot, along with hypopigmented patches on the face and scalp, is not consistent with any of the other options provided. The histologic analysis showing intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies further supports the diagnosis of cutaneous diphtheria. Cutaneous diphtheria is caused by the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae and typically presents as a chronic ulcer with a grayish membrane. Treatment involves administration of diphtheria antitoxin and appropriate antibiotics.

The correct answer is C: Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy.

Explanation: Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is a rare condition characterized by dilated superficial blood vessels with thick walls in the absence of inflammation. It predominantly affects the lower extremities, usually in older individuals. The clinical presentation typically includes blanchable, salmon-colored patches with fine telangiectasias. Histopathological examination reveals thickened capillary walls surrounded by concentric hyaline material. The condition is benign and nonsymptomatic, and no specific treatment is required. The other answer options (A, B, D) are not consistent with the clinical features and histological findings described in the case.
C

776
The correct answer is B: Brown tumor.

Explanation: Brown tumor is a rare benign lesion that can occur in patients with hyperparathyroidism. It is a reactive, non-neoplastic lesion characterized by the replacement of normal bone by fibrous tissue and hemosiderin-laden giant cells. The hyperparathyroidism leads to excessive osteoclastic activity, resulting in bone resorption and the formation of these tumors. Brown tumors can occur in any bone, but are most commonly found in the hands, feet, and facial bones. The characteristic brown color of the tumor is due to the deposition of hemosiderin. In this case, the patient's history of primary hyperparathyroidism, along with the radiographic findings and histopathological analysis, support the diagnosis of a brown tumor.

777
The diagnosis is C: Monilethrix.

Explanation:
Monilethrix is a rare inherited hair disorder characterized by short, brittle hairs that break easily, leading to hair loss. The hair shafts have a beaded appearance under the microscope, as seen in the trichography results. In this case, the patient's history, including the early onset of hair loss, the presence of follicular hyperkeratosis, and the family history of hair loss, are all consistent with the diagnosis of monilethrix. Tinea capitis and psoriasis typically present with scaling and/or erythema, which are not prominent in this case. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects copper metabolism and is associated with brittle, kinky hair, but it typically presents with other systemic manifestations such as growth retardation, neurological abnormalities, and connective tissue disorders, which are not mentioned in this case.

The answer is C: Intramural small bowel hematoma.

Explanation: The CT scan shows a bowel loop with a thickened wall, which is indicative of intramural hematoma. This finding, along with the patient's history of bicycle handlebar injury and symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting, suggests an intramural small bowel hematoma as the most likely diagnosis. Other options such as abdominal wall hematoma, small-bowel perforation, or traumatic pancreatic injury do not match the imaging findings or clinical presentation.

779
The diagnosis is A: Acute appendicitis.

Explanation: The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain, tenderness in the right iliac fossa, positive Blumberg sign, and elevated inflammatory markers. The transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound scans showed a mildly inflamed appendix with stratification of the appendiceal wall. The MRI confirmed the presence of an inflamed and thickened appendix. The patient's symptoms did not resolve with conservative management and intravenous antibiotics, indicating persistent appendicitis.

I would choose answer option C: Order biopsy of chorioretinal lesion.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of new-onset floaters, along with the presence of deep, white chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole and periphery, raises concerns for potential underlying pathology. Given the patient's history of West Nile virus encephalitis and the absence of other detectable viral infections, it is important to further investigate the etiology of these chorioretinal lesions. A biopsy of the lesion can help determine the cause and guide appropriate management. This could involve histopathological examination and molecular testing to identify any viral or inflammatory etiology.
D
cellvalue empty
781
C: Order magnetic resonance imaging for the orbits and brain.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with acute vision loss, optic nerve head edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and other neurological symptoms (facial palsy and swelling) raises concern for possible optic nerve infiltration and increased intracranial pressure. Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the orbits and brain would help assess for any mass effect on the optic nerve or other intracranial pathology. This imaging modality would provide more information about the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss and guide further management decisions. A lumbar puncture may be considered if intracranial involvement is suspected, but MRI would be the next appropriate step in evaluating this patient. Optic nerve decompression may be considered in cases of acute optic nerve compression, but without further information about the cause of the patient's symptoms, it would not be the next appropriate step.
C
cellvalue empty
782
C: Order indocyanine green angiography and photodynamic therapy

Explanation: The presence of a yellowish orange discontinuity in the inferior peripapillary region of the optic nerve, along with findings of optical coherence tomography (OCT) showing a hyporeflective expansive cavity with adjacent choroidal schisis and a nerve fiber layer defect, suggests the possibility of peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PICC). In cases of PICC, indocyanine green angiography can be helpful in identifying the extent and characteristics of the lesion. Photodynamic therapy can be considered as a treatment option for PICC, as it has been shown to be effective in cases with progressive visual disturbances. Therefore, ordering indocyanine green angiography and considering photodynamic therapy would be the appropriate next steps.
D

783
I would choose answer option C: Perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start intravenous antibiotics.

Explanation: The patient is experiencing pain and redness with the development of a creamy fluctuant elevated lesion on examination. This suggests an infectious process, such as an abscess. To properly diagnose and treat the condition, exploratory surgery in the operating room would be necessary to visualize and potentially drain the abscess. Additionally, starting intravenous antibiotics would help to target any bacterial infection that may be present. This approach would provide the most comprehensive evaluation and treatment for the patient's symptoms.
D

784
The correct diagnosis is: B: Primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC.

Explanation: The patient in this case has a confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the oral cavity, with a history of recurrent oral cancer. The PET scan revealed focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in the known oral cavity SCC, as well as in a small lymph node. Additionally, there was prominent metabolic activity in the left vocal cord, which is asymmetrically enlarged and immobile.

This pattern of findings is consistent with a primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma would typically present with involvement of multiple sites, rather than being localized to the oral cavity and vocal cord.

Inflammatory reaction and postradiation change are less likely diagnoses in this case, given the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and the specific findings on PET scan.
C

785
D: Genetic testing.

Explanation: The young man presents with dyspnea on exertion, leg swelling, progressive muscle weakness, and a family history of congestive heart failure. The presence of elevated creatine kinase levels and the ECG findings of global hypokinesia with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) suggest a possible underlying genetic myopathy. Additionally, the presence of symptoms in his younger brother supports a genetic etiology. Therefore, genetic testing is the next appropriate step to determine if the patient has an inherited cardiomyopathy or muscular dystrophy. This will help to guide further management and provide information regarding family screening and counseling. Other invasive procedures such as treadmill stress test, cardiac catheterization, and electrophysiological study may not be necessary at this point without further evidence of coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities.
D
cellvalue empty
786
My diagnosis is D: Myopericytoma.

Explanation: The histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical stains are indicative of a myopericytoma. The well-circumscribed submucosal lesion comprised of bland, round, syncytial cells arranged around vascular spaces, along with positive staining for smooth-muscle actin (SMA), muscle-specific actin, and CD34, are consistent with myopericytoma. Glomus tumor typically shows more uniform, small, rounded cells and is negative for CD34. Myofibroma usually exhibits a more immature appearance with more fibroblastic-like cells. Solitary fibrous tumor is typically CD34 positive but lacks the characteristic arrangement of cells around vascular spaces seen in myopericytoma.
D
787
The correct answer is C: Small-cell carcinoma.

Explanation: Based on the histological analysis and immunoreactivity results, the presentation is consistent with small-cell carcinoma. Small-cell carcinoma is a highly aggressive and malignant tumor commonly found in the lung, but it can also occur in other sites, including the head and neck region. The presence of small round-oval uniform cells with minimal cytoplasm, granular chromatin pattern, and prominent nuclear molding is characteristic of small-cell carcinoma. Additionally, the positive immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7 and synaptophysin further supports this diagnosis. The high mitotic rate seen on histological analysis indicates the aggressive nature of this tumor. The detection of HPV 16 DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suggests a possible viral association, which is known to be a risk factor for small-cell carcinoma.
C
788
A: Multiple myeloma

Explanation: The patient's presentation of clear nasal discharge, history of meningitis, and imaging findings of a lytic lesion in the occipital bone suggest the possibility of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm that can manifest with lytic bone lesions, including involvement of the skull base. The thinning of the bony cortex and herniation of nonenhancing meninges seen on MRI are consistent with a CSF leak, which can occur with skull base involvement in multiple myeloma. Further evaluation, such as biopsy or serum/urine protein electrophoresis, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
C
789
I would choose answer option C: Inquire about history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of poor vision, photophobia, fair skin, platinum hair, and blue eyes is indicative of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). OCA is a group of genetic disorders that result in decreased melanin production, leading to hypopigmented hair, skin, and eyes. OCA is associated with various ocular abnormalities, including nystagmus.

However, the presence of a cutaneous melanoma in this patient raises concerns for a potential genetic disorder called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), which can be associated with OCA and an increased risk of melanoma. One of the hallmark features of HPS is abnormal bleeding, due to platelet dysfunction. Since the patient has a history of melanoma, it is important to inquire about any history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding, as these can be indicative of HPS.

Therefore, prior to performing a dilated ophthalmic examination or ordering molecular genetic testing, it is important to gather more information about the patient's medical history to assess the need for further evaluation or genetic testing.

B: Biopsy the lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's history, a rapidly enlarging and ulcerated nodule on the finger, and the absence of systemic symptoms or signs of infection on physical examination, a biopsy of the lesion would be the most appropriate next step. This will help determine the underlying cause of the nodule and guide further management. Other options such as incision and drainage, prescribing an anti-inflammatory agent, or performing a touch preparation would not provide a definitive diagnosis.

The correct answer is C: Granuloma annulare.

Explanation: 
Granuloma annulare is a common, benign, self-limiting skin condition that typically presents as annular plaques with central clearing. It can occur at any age but is more common in children and young adults. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an abnormal immune response. Lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, but a skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis by showing a characteristic histopathologic pattern with a palisaded granulomatous infiltrate. Treatment is generally not necessary as the lesions tend to resolve spontaneously, but options include topical corticosteroids, intralesional corticosteroids, and cryotherapy.

792
The diagnosis is:

B: Cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis

Explanation: The patient's history of essential thrombocytosis and the presence of an enlarging, painful leg ulcer are consistent with microvascular occlusion, a known complication of this condition. The violaceous, photodistributed cutaneous eruption on the patient's hands and forearms is also characteristic of cutaneous microvascular occlusion. A lesional skin biopsy would further confirm this diagnosis by showing evidence of microvascular thrombosis.

793
The correct answer is D: Sneddon syndrome.

Explanation: Sneddon syndrome is a rare non-inflammatory arteriopathy characterized by the presence of livedo racemosa and cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic strokes. It primarily affects young adults, mainly females. Livedo racemosa refers to net-like violaceous patches on the skin. This syndrome is often associated with Raynaud phenomenon, which was present in this case. Additionally, the patient had a history of multiple strokes and showed acute dot-like diffusion anomalies on MRI, consistent with ischemic infarctions. The skin biopsy may reveal characteristic findings of Sneddon syndrome, including intimal proliferation and fibrosis of small and medium-sized arteries.

Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (van Lohuizen syndrome) is a congenital vascular disorder characterized by persistent cutis marmorata (mottled skin) and telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels). It typically presents at birth or early infancy and is not associated with strokes.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin manifestations. However, the presented case does not have any other features suggestive of SLE, such as renal involvement, joint pain, or positive antinuclear antibodies.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, immunodeficiency, and telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels). The patient in this case did not have any features of ataxia-telangiectasia.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and findings, Sneddon syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.

794
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is D: Neurosarcoidosis.

Explanation: Neurosarcoidosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the central nervous system. It can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, and focal brain lesions. The MRI findings in this case - T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) changes with associated patchy enhancement in multiple brain regions - are consistent with the typical imaging findings seen in neurosarcoidosis. Additionally, the CSF findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein level are also supportive of the diagnosis. The patient's response to corticosteroid treatment further supports the diagnosis, as sarcoidosis is known to be responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. The other answer options (A: Multiple sclerosis, B: Central nervous system lymphoma, C: Autoimmune encephalitis) can be ruled out based on the clinical and imaging findings, as well as the lack of response to corticosteroids in these conditions.
C

795
B: Melanoma

Explanation: The rapidly changing nature and evolution of the skin lesion, along with the development of new black spots and vesicles, are concerning for malignancy, specifically melanoma. The patient's family history of dysplastic nevus syndrome and melanoma further supports this diagnosis. Congenital nevi typically do not change significantly over time, angiokeratomas typically present as small red or purple papules without vesicles, and mastocytomas typically present as reddish-brown patches or nodules. A dermatologic evaluation should be done to confirm the diagnosis and further assess the patient.

My Diagnosis: C: Carcinoma

Explanation: The patient's history, examination findings, and imaging results are suggestive of breast cancer in a man. The presence of a hard, irregular, and mobile nodule in the retroareolar area of the right breast, tethered to the overlying skin but not to the underlying muscle, raises suspicion for malignancy. Additionally, the palpable lymph nodes on the same side further support the possibility of cancer. The mammogram and computed tomography scan also demonstrate the involvement of the breast mass with the skin. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is carcinoma.

The correct answer is D: Superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism.

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms of diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis, along with physical examination findings of a distended abdomen, diffuse rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding, are concerning for a cause of acute abdominal pain. The abnormal laboratory values indicate possible hypovolemia (low sodium) and tissue ischemia (elevated lactate). Computed tomography findings of dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls and mesenteric edema are consistent with small-bowel ischemia.

Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) thromboembolism is a rare cause of small-bowel ischemia but is associated with a high mortality rate if not promptly recognized and treated. It typically occurs due to embolization of a thrombus from a proximal source, such as the heart or aorta, into the SMA. Risk factors for SMA thromboembolism include atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, recent myocardial infarction, and aortic atherosclerosis.

Although inflammatory bowel disease (option A) can cause abdominal pain and bowel wall thickening, the acute onset and severity of symptoms, as well as the lack of chronicity in this case, make inflammatory bowel disease less likely. Small-bowel neoplasm (option B) is a consideration in the differential diagnosis of small-bowel ischemia, but the acute presentation in this case is more suggestive of an acute vascular event. Mesenteric venous thrombosis (option C) can cause mesenteric edema and small-bowel ischemia, but the lack of free air on imaging makes this diagnosis less likely.

B: Probe with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system

Explanation: Silicone intubation is a common treatment for infants with acute dacryocystitis. It involves the insertion of a silicone tube into the nasolacrimal duct to keep it open and facilitate drainage of the blocked tear duct. This can be done under local anesthesia and is a minimally invasive procedure. It has been shown to be effective in resolving symptoms and preventing recurrence of dacryocystitis in infants. Transition to oral antibiotics and discharge is not recommended at this stage as the patient is still undergoing treatment and follow-up is needed. Lacrimal sac digital massage may not be sufficient to resolve the blockage and endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to initial treatments.

Based on the clinical presentation and MRI findings, the most appropriate next step would be to order a lumbar puncture (Answer option A). The patient's symptoms of severe bilateral optic disc edema, retinal hemorrhages, headache, and neurological symptoms suggest the possibility of increased intracranial pressure. The MRI findings of diffuse abnormalities in the brain further support this suspicion. A lumbar puncture can help confirm the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) by demonstrating an elevated opening pressure and the absence of other underlying causes such as infection or inflammation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with the diagnosis of IIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri. IIH is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without the presence of a space-occupying lesion. It predominantly affects young, obese women of childbearing age, although it can occur in males and individuals of any weight.

The presentation typically includes symptoms such as headache, transient visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, and diplopia. Visual changes can range from mild blurring to severe vision loss, as seen in this case.

MRI findings in IIH often show empty sella, flattening of the posterior globe, and dilatation of the optic nerve sheaths. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences can reveal diffuse signal abnormalities involving the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and cerebellum, as seen in this patient.

Lumbar puncture is an essential diagnostic step in patients suspected of having IIH. It allows for the measurement of the opening pressure and the evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. In IIH, the opening pressure is typically elevated (>25 cm H2O) without any other abnormalities in the CSF.

Other potential causes of optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, such as infection or inflammation, can be ruled out by performing a lumbar puncture and analyzing the CSF.

Treatment of IIH involves weight reduction, acetazolamide, and potential surgical interventions in refractory cases. However, initiating treatment should be based on confirmed diagnosis through lumbar puncture. Therefore, prescribing corticosteroids and consulting rheumatology (B) or prescribing azithromycin (C) would not be appropriate before ruling out other potential causes with a lumbar puncture.

Measuring the patient's blood pressure (D) may be a routine part of the examination, but it is unlikely to provide any specific information that would guide the diagnosis and management of this patient's condition.
Option A: Ask the patient to taper the oral prednisone and reassure her that the symptoms will gradually resolve

Explanation: The patient's blurry vision is likely due to the presence of subretinal fluid, which can occur as a complication of Bell palsy. The oral prednisone that the patient was taking for the Bell palsy can cause fluid retention and exacerbate the subretinal fluid. By tapering the oral prednisone, the fluid retention and associated symptoms should gradually resolve. No further interventions or workup are necessary at this point.

C: Perform Tzanck smear on swab from ulcerated lesion

Explanation: Performing a Tzanck smear on a swab from the ulcerated lesion can help identify the cause of the eyelid edema and ulceration. A Tzanck smear is a microscopic examination of cells collected from an open blister or ulcer, which can reveal the presence of multinucleated giant cells, indicating a viral infection such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. This is important in determining the appropriate treatment for the patient.

The correct answer is B: Spontaneous perinephric hematoma.

Explanation: The sudden onset of severe left flank pain, hypotension, and left renal angle tenderness suggests a retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's history of receiving ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is relevant as there have been reports of spontaneous bleeding and hemorrhagic complications associated with this medication. The CT scan shows a perinephric hematoma, supporting the diagnosis of a spontaneous perinephric hematoma. Additional findings of acute onset thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis may be indicative of a bleeding disorder or hematological malignancy exacerbating the bleeding risk. An abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture would typically present with a pulsatile abdominal mass, not a perinephric hematoma. Splenic rupture would present with left upper quadrant pain and signs of intra-abdominal bleeding. Pyelonephritis would typically present with fever, dysuria, and urinary symptoms, which are not described in the case.

803
The answer option is B: Refer for surgical valve replacement.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of multiple systemic emboli, including pulmonary emboli, subacute embolic cortical infarcts, and dural metastases, along with the presence of bulky masses on the tips of both mitral valve leaflets and a multilobulated mass on the subvalvular chordae of the tricuspid valve, indicate the presence of significant cardiac involvement. Surgical valve replacement would be the most appropriate intervention to address these masses and prevent further emboli and complications. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case as there is no evidence of infection. Full-dose anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient to address the cardiac masses and prevent further emboli. Initiation of chemotherapy (erlotinib) may be necessary for the management of lung adenocarcinoma but would not directly address the cardiac masses. Therefore, the best next step would be to refer the patient for surgical valve replacement.

The correct answer is A: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including unilateral nasal obstruction, soft-tissue mass on nasal endoscopy, and complete opacification of the right paranasal sinuses on CT scan, is consistent with a sinonasal tumor. Histopathologic analysis revealed a uniform spindle cell tumor with positive staining for S-100 and actin, which are consistent with a biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. Other immunostains performed were negative, ruling out other differential diagnoses such as solitary fibrous tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and synovial sarcoma.
A
805
The correct answer is C: Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a firm, tender parotid mass in a pediatric patient along with histopathologic findings of confluent granulomata with Langhans-type giant cells and central necrosis is consistent with histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, also known as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. This is a benign lymphadenopathy that typically presents in young adults and is characterized by self-limiting cervical lymphadenitis with histologic features of necrosis and a histiocytic infiltrate. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination and exclusion of other causes of necrotizing lymphadenitis. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a salivary gland neoplasm that typically presents with painless enlargement of the parotid gland and would not exhibit the histopathologic findings described in this case. Infectious pseudotumor is an inflammatory process that can mimic a neoplasm and typically demonstrates a more pronounced fibrohistiocytic infiltrate on histopathologic examination. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically affects the respiratory tract and is associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss.
B
806
The correct answer is A: Laryngotracheitis (croup).

Explanation: The clinical presentation of biphasic stridor, worsened respiratory distress, tachypnea, and weak cry are consistent with upper airway obstruction. The patient's history of prematurity and intubation, as well as the presence of a viral infection (rhinovirus), further support the diagnosis of croup. The prolonged expiratory phase with a restrictive "shark fin" waveform on capnography is characteristic of upper airway obstruction seen in croup. The direct laryngoscopy would also show signs of inflammatory changes in the larynx and trachea. Subglottic cyst, subglottic stenosis, and subglottic hemangioma are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings.
B
807
Answer: B: Cutaneous malakoplakia

Explanation: Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of well-demarcated erythematous nodules on the skin, typically involving the genital and perianal regions. These nodules are often painful and may have a burning sensation. Patients with cutaneous malakoplakia may have a history of intertrigo, similar to this patient, as the condition can arise as a complication of chronic inflammation. In this case, the patient's previous intertrigo improved with treatment but subsequently developed new nodules, consistent with cutaneous malakoplakia. The patient's medical history is notable for prostate cancer, which can increase the risk of cutaneous malakoplakia. Other causes of scrotal nodules, such as deep fungal infection, granular cell tumor, and metastatic prostate cancer, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and patient's medical history. A definitive diagnosis would require a skin biopsy for histopathological examination.

Diagnosis: C: Secondary syphilis

Explanation: The patient's presentation of annular red plaques with scale and erosions, particularly the corymbiform pattern with central and satellite lesions, is highly suggestive of secondary syphilis. The presence of papulosquamous lesions on the left sole, sparing of the palms, and absence of systemic involvement further support this diagnosis. The histopathologic evaluation of biopsy specimens showing an identical pattern is also consistent with secondary syphilis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antibiotics is essential to prevent further complications.

809
The correct answer is B: Subcutaneous sarcoidosis.

Explanation: 

The patient's clinical presentation of enlarging, nonpainful subcutaneous nodules in a sporotrichoid pattern, along with the presence of large nodules on the trunk and abdomen, is suggestive of subcutaneous sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder that can involve various organs, including the skin. Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare variant, characterized by subcutaneous nodules that are typically painless and may coalesce.

The patient's history of exposure to intoxicating mold at the construction site is noteworthy, as environmental exposure has been implicated in the development of sarcoidosis in susceptible individuals. Additionally, the presence of pathological fracture and hilar lymphadenopathy further supports the diagnosis of subcutaneous sarcoidosis.

The histopathology findings of nodular aggregations of epithelioid histiocytes with few other inflammatory cells, known as "naked granulomas," are consistent with sarcoidosis. These granulomas can extend into the subcutis.

The negative staining for fungal and mycobacterial organisms rules out sporotrichosis and tuberculosis. Tumoral calcinosis is characterized by calcium deposition in soft tissues, but it typically presents as painless, firm nodules rather than soft, boggy nodules. Erythema nodosum is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by painful, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

The correct answer is B: Vitamin A deficiency.

Explanation: Based on the history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is vitamin A deficiency. The child's symptoms of progressive vision loss, night blindness, light sensitivity, and dry eyes are consistent with vitamin A deficiency. The dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva (Bitot spots) and corneal epitheliopathy seen on examination are characteristic findings of vitamin A deficiency. The presence of mild optic nerve pallor is also suggestive of this nutritional deficiency. The child's restrictive diet and history of eczema and multiple food allergies may have contributed to his inadequate intake of vitamin A-rich foods, leading to the deficiency. Treatment would involve oral vitamin A supplementation and addressing any underlying dietary issues to ensure adequate nutrient intake.

The correct answer is B: Acute appendicitis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the 1-week history of worsening right lower quadrant tenderness, fullness, diarrhea, vomiting, fevers, and chills, along with the physical examination findings of localized tenderness with guarding and fullness in the right lower quadrant, are indicative of acute appendicitis. The elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level are consistent with an inflammatory process. The CT scan showing a large right-sided inflammatory phlegmon further supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Exploratory laparotomy is often performed for confirmation and treatment of acute appendicitis.

The correct answer is D: Superior mesenteric artery embolism.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive abdominal pain and diarrhea, along with the dilation of her abdomen and tenderness, raise concern for a vascular etiology. The computed tomography (CT) scans show progression of the disease, with the initial scan revealing isolated duodenal thickening and the readmission scan demonstrating thickened small bowel and free fluid. These findings suggest compromised blood supply to the mesenteric artery territory. Superior mesenteric artery embolism is a possible diagnosis that would explain the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

813
C: Counsel the patient on the prognosis of his condition

Explanation: At this point, it is important to explain to the patient that he has suffered profound vision loss following his traumatic work injury. The fundus photographs reveal optic disc pallor, indicating damage to the optic nerves. Since the optic nerves appear normal in the photographs, there is no immediate need for further imaging or testing. Instead, counseling the patient on the prognosis of his condition and discussing potential treatment options would be the next appropriate step. Optokinetic nystagmus drums are typically used for assessing visual function, but they would not be helpful in this case where the patient has no light perception. Repeat brain MRI is not necessary since the previous imaging was normal. Dilute pilocarpine testing is used to assess pupillary function and would not provide any additional information regarding the patient's visual loss.

Answer: C: Order contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

Explanation: Given the patient's presenting symptoms of facial numbness, ocular pain, and persistent symptoms despite treatment for blepharitis, there is a concern for a possible underlying neurological cause. The reduced sensation in the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the right trigeminal nerve, including complete corneal anesthesia, further supports the need for further investigation. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or lesions that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

D: Discuss carefully observing vs surgical repair of the ptosis.

Explanation: Based on the given case information, the 5-year-old girl has unilateral congenital ptosis, which is drooping of the eyelid present since birth. It is important to consider the potential causes and evaluate the severity before determining the appropriate course of action.

In this case, the child has notable asymmetry in eyelid measurements, with the left eye showing more pronounced ptosis compared to the right eye. The eyelid measurements, as well as the observation of elevation of the left upper eyelid with lateral jaw thrust, suggest that the ptosis may be caused by weakness or dysfunction of the levator muscle.

Before considering any invasive interventions such as genetic testing, neuroimaging, or oral corticosteroids (which are not indicated in this case), it is prudent to discuss with the parents the option of carefully observing the ptosis versus surgical repair. Surgical repair of ptosis can be considered to improve cosmetic appearance, functional vision, and to prevent the development of amblyopia in children.

The decision between observing and surgical repair depends on factors such as the severity of the ptosis, effect on vision, presence of functional limitations, and the patient and family's preferences. In this case, considering the significant asymmetry in eyelid measurements and the observation of functional improvement with jaw thrust, surgical repair may be a reasonable option to discuss with the parents.

It is important to involve the expertise of an ophthalmologist or a pediatric ophthalmologist for a thorough evaluation and to discuss the potential risks, benefits, and long-term outcomes of surgical repair in this specific case.

I would choose answer option C: Incisional biopsy. 

Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with progressive restrictive strabismus, drooping of the left upper eyelid, and diplopia, along with an intraconal mass in the left orbit. Given the patient's symptoms and the presence of the mass, an incisional biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in order to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation. This would help in determining the nature of the mass and guide further management. Excisional biopsy may be more appropriate if the mass is small and easily accessible, but in this case, an incisional biopsy would be the preferred initial approach. Beginning chemotherapy or corticosteroid treatment without a definitive diagnosis would not be advisable.

817
B: Immune dysregulation from multiagent therapy resulting in a new M-protein.

Explanation: The presence of a new M-IgG κ band in the same electrophoretic position as the original M-IgA κ suggests a change in the type of monoclonal protein being produced. This change is likely a result of immune dysregulation caused by the multiagent therapy (bortezimib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone–elotuzumab) that the patient is undergoing. It is important to note that this new M-protein is not a result of clonal evolution of myeloma cells or a new MGUS or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as elotuzumab, would typically be detected at higher serum concentrations and would not explain the presence of the new M-protein.

C: Order 30-day event monitoring.

Explanation:
Given the patient's presentation of unheralded syncope and findings on electrocardiography, further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Ordering a 30-day event monitoring is an appropriate next step as it can capture episodes of arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities that may be contributing to the syncope. This monitoring method allows for continuous recording of the patient's cardiac rhythm over an extended period, increasing the likelihood of capturing any abnormalities that occur intermittently. The results of the event monitoring can guide further diagnostic and management decisions.

819
B: Discontinue antibiotic therapy and consider systemic corticosteroids

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of the patient, with fever and the development of pruritic, erythematous macules and papules following HSCT, along with the pulmonary findings on computed tomography, a drug reaction is suspected. The skin biopsy showing vacuolar change, epidermal dyskeratosis, and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate further supports this suspicion. The most likely diagnosis is a drug reaction, such as a cutaneous drug eruption or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.

Given the lack of improvement with cefepime therapy and the absence of infectious etiologies identified thus far, discontinuing the antibiotic therapy is appropriate. Distinguishing between a cutaneous drug eruption and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome is often challenging, but in this case, the presence of systemic symptoms like diarrhea and weight gain suggests a more severe drug reaction. 

Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and will help to ameliorate the patient's symptoms. Additionally, consultation with a dermatologist for further evaluation of the rash and consideration of skin patch testing may be beneficial.

The correct answer is D: The patient is taking methadone, morphine, hydromorphone, and codeine.

Explanation:
The urine drug screen results in Table 1 show the presence of methadone (MDN), morphine (MOR), hydromorphone (HYD), and codeine (COD). These medications match the patient's reported pain medication regimen of methadone, immediate-release morphine, and gabapentin. Both methadone and morphine, which are detected in the urine, are consistent with the prescribed medications. Codeine is a metabolite of both morphine and hydromorphone, so its presence suggests the use of these drugs as well. Therefore, the patient is taking methadone, morphine, hydromorphone, and codeine.

B: Scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA

Explanation: The patient's presentation of scrotal ulceration is most likely a side effect of the induction chemotherapy with ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and idarubicin. This complication is well-documented in patients receiving ATRA-based treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML). The scrotal ulceration may be related to the development of ATRA syndrome, a potentially life-threatening complication characterized by fever, pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, and leukocytosis. The progression of scrotal ulceration coinciding with recovery in neutrophil count and persistent pyrexia further supports this diagnosis. The absence of bacterial or viral infection on cultures and the lack of improvement with systemic antifungal and antiviral therapy rule out other potential causes.

Answer: B: Malignant atrophic papulosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of numerous 5- to 10-mm nontender papules with a porcelain-white atrophic center and an erythematous halo, alongside scattered atrophic white scars, is consistent with the diagnosis of malignant atrophic papulosis, also known as Degos disease. This is a rare systemic vasculopathy characterized by cutaneous and visceral involvement, most commonly affecting the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The findings on biopsy, including occlusion of dermal blood vessels, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and mucin deposition, support the diagnosis of malignant atrophic papulosis. Pancreatitis panniculitis (A) is characterized by subcutaneous fat necrosis associated with pancreatitis, which is not present in this case. Systemic lupus erythematosus (C) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a variety of skin manifestations, including the classic malar "butterfly" rash, which is absent in this case. Lymphomatoid papulosis (D) is characterized by a recurrent, self-healing skin eruption with histopathologic features resembling cutaneous lymphoma, which is different from the findings described in this case.

The correct answer is A: Bullous pemphigoid.

Explanation: 
Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by tense blisters on the skin that do not scar. In this case, the patient had pruritic erythema on the trunk and extremities for 1 year, which did not respond to various treatments. The presence of tense blisters on the arms, hands, soles, and buttocks, along with the histopathologic findings of a subepidermal bulla with neutrophilic infiltrate, is consistent with bullous pemphigoid.

The negative result of the IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for BP180 noncollagenous 16A antibodies is not uncommon, as it is estimated that only 60-70% of patients with bullous pemphigoid have detectable circulating anti-BP180 antibodies.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is another autoimmune blistering disorder but is characterized by scarring and milia formation, which were not observed in this case.

Anti-laminin γ1 pemphigoid and linear IgA dermatosis are different autoimmune blistering disorders that typically present with linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane zone and are unlikely based on the clinical and histopathologic findings in this case.

The correct answer is C: Muckle-Wells syndrome.

Explanation: Muckle-Wells syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fevers, hivelike urticaria, and other systemic symptoms such as conjunctivitis, arthralgias, and irritability. The fevers typically last for several days and recur frequently, often monthly. The urticarial lesions are nonpruritic and do not respond to antihistamine medication. Joint involvement can lead to limited range of motion and pain symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms, including recurrent fevers, nonpruritic urticaria, and joint pain, are consistent with Muckle-Wells syndrome.

The answer is B: Compartment syndrome resulting from infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues of the upper extremity.

Explanation: The patient has developed right upper extremity pain and swelling after an attempted peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion. Physical examination findings, such as tense and tender swelling of the right upper extremity with impaired motor function and absent radial pulse, suggest the development of compartment syndrome. Duplex ultrasonographic imaging reveals a heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow, indicating extravasation of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues. This secondary compartment syndrome is a potentially serious complication that requires immediate intervention to prevent tissue necrosis and further damage. Other options, such as deep vein thrombosis (Option A), secondary lymphedema (Option C), and brachial artery pseudoaneurysm (Option D), do not fully explain the clinical presentation and findings in this case.

826
Based on the information provided, the correct diagnosis is D: Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting along with the physical examination findings of epigastric tenderness with rebound and guarding suggest an acute abdomen. The presence of a low systolic blood pressure, elevated pulse rate, and laboratory abnormalities such as anemia and elevated white blood cell count also indicate a potentially serious condition.

The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) image shows an intra-abdominal hyperdense mass and free fluid in the upper abdomen, indicating the presence of an aneurysm. The visceral artery angiogram confirms the presence of an aneurysm. This aneurysm is classified as a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm, which is a known complication of acute pancreatitis.

Rupture of the peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm can result in free fluid in the abdomen, causing the patient's symptoms. It can also lead to significant blood loss and can explain the anemia and elevated pulse rate. This condition is considered a surgical emergency and requires urgent intervention to prevent further complications such as hemorrhagic shock.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis in this case is D: Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm.

827
D: Proceed with sclerotomies, ie, creation of scleral windows.

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, including the elevated IOP, shallow AC, ciliochoroidal mass, and serous retinal detachment, the most likely diagnosis is a ciliochoroidal effusion or ciliochoroidal detachment. This condition is a potential emergency as it can lead to further complications such as angle-closure glaucoma and vision loss.

Sclerotomies, or creation of scleral windows, can help release the trapped fluid in the anterior chamber and relieve the intraocular pressure. This procedure involves making small incisions in the sclera to allow drainage of the fluid.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy, plaque radiotherapy, and oral corticosteroids are not appropriate treatments for ciliochoroidal effusion. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is typically used for obtaining tissue samples for further diagnosis in cases of suspected malignancies. Plaque radiotherapy is used for the treatment of ocular tumors. Oral corticosteroids may be used in certain inflammatory conditions but are not indicated for ciliochoroidal effusion.

C: Obtain blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.

Explanation:
Given the progressive generalized autonomic dysfunction symptoms experienced by the patient, it is important to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. This condition involves the autoimmune attack on autonomic ganglia, leading to autonomic dysfunction. The symptoms described, such as reduced food intake, weight loss, constipation, urinary retention, anhidrosis, xerostomia, and xerophthalmia, are consistent with autonomic dysfunction.

Obtaining a blood sample to investigate for specific antibodies associated with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. This would involve testing for autoantibodies against ganglionic acetylcholine receptors, ganglionic neuronal surface antigens, or other relevant autoantibodies.

Prescribing phototropic variofocal glasses (A) or starting pilocarpine eyedrops (B) would not address the underlying autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy and its associated symptoms.

Genetic testing (D) may not be necessary at this point since there are no indications of a genetic condition in the case history. Blood sample investigation for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is a more appropriate next step.

A: Reassure the patient that VF loss is due to remote ischemic optic neuropathy and consider daily aspirin.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of stable VF loss, bilateral tilted optic nerves with peripapillary atrophy, and absence of other concerning findings, the most likely cause of his visual field loss is remote ischemic optic neuropathy. This is a non-progressive condition that is typically associated with certain risk factors, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Reassuring the patient and considering daily aspirin as a preventative measure for vascular events would be appropriate in this case.

A: Order an emergent coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and the new onset of chest pain, ST elevations, and reduced left ventricular function on echocardiogram, it is crucial to evaluate for possible acute coronary syndrome causing his symptoms. An emergent coronary angiogram can help identify any significant coronary artery disease or acute ischemic changes. Additionally, an endomyocardial biopsy should be performed to assess for ongoing rejection or other causes of cardiac dysfunction in this post-transplant patient. Checking cytomegalovirus viral load and administering empirical pulse-dose corticosteroids may be considered after obtaining the results of the coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy to further guide management. Performing an endomyocardial biopsy alone may not provide definitive information regarding coronary artery patency and potential ischemia.

B: Erysipelas

Explanation: The patient's history of breast cancer and the presentation of erysipeloid plaques on the chest and back are consistent with erysipelas, which is a bacterial skin infection commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. It typically presents as well-demarcated, warm, and indurated plaques, as seen in the clinical examination. Lesional skin biopsies would typically show acute inflammation with neutrophilic infiltrates.

Carcinoma erysipeloides (cutaneous metastases of breast cancer) is a possibility to consider given the patient's history, but the clinical presentation and biopsy findings described are more suggestive of erysipelas. Radiation dermatitis and radiation-induced morphea are less likely given the absence of recent radiation therapy and the specific clinical and histopathological characteristics described.

C: Perform a skeletal survey and refer for ophthalmologic consultation.

Explanation: The presence of multiple hyperpigmented macules in a child, especially in unusual locations such as the back and thighs, warrants further investigation. Performing a skeletal survey can help identify any skeletal abnormalities, which may be associated with certain genetic disorders. Referring for ophthalmologic consultation is important to evaluate for any ocular manifestations that may be present in certain genetic syndromes. Administering topical antifungals (option A) would not be appropriate as there are no signs or symptoms of a fungal infection. Taking a more detailed drug history (option B) may be helpful in other cases but is not indicated in this specific scenario. Stroking the skin lesion (option D) would not provide any diagnostic or therapeutic benefit.

The answer option is: B: Proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with elevated serum creatinine, tea-colored urine, and previous history of hypertension suggests a possible kidney disease. The urine studies show the presence of red blood cells, red blood cell casts, and proteinuria, which are consistent with glomerulonephritis. Proliferative glomerulonephritis is characterized by inflammation and proliferation of cells within the glomerulus, leading to impaired kidney function. The structurally normal appearance of the kidneys on ultrasound also supports a glomerular pathology rather than a urinary tract infection or hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis is less likely as it typically presents with minimal or no proliferation of cells within the glomeruli.

D: Pemphigus vulgaris.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of multiple erythematous crusted plaques on the trunk, with a peripheral crusted and pustular collarette, along with the histopathologic finding of suprabasilar acantholysis (detachment of epidermal cells above the basal layer), the most likely diagnosis is pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the formation of intraepidermal blisters due to autoantibodies targeting desmoglein-3, a protein present in desmosomes. It commonly presents with oral mucosal involvement and can also affect other non-mucosal surfaces such as the trunk in a disseminated fashion. Direct immunofluorescence and microbiological cultures can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differential diagnoses. Pemphigus foliaceus and IgA pemphigus are less likely due to the absence of specific clinical and histopathologic features associated with these conditions. Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease typically presents with symmetric intertriginous plaques in areas such as the axillae and groin, which is not consistent with the current patient's presentation.

The diagnosis for this case is A: Oral melanotic macule.

Explanation: 

Based on the clinical presentation and histological findings described, the most likely diagnosis is an oral melanotic macule. Oral melanotic macules are benign, focal areas of increased melanin pigmentation that commonly occur on the oral mucosa, including the gingiva. They are usually asymptomatic and can appear as flat or slightly raised, well-circumscribed lesions with varying degrees of pigmentation. Histologically, oral melanotic macules show an increase in melanin pigment in the basal cell layer of the epithelium, with the presence of melanocytes.

Oral malignant melanoma (B) is a rare and aggressive malignancy of melanocytes that can occur in the oral cavity. It typically presents as a rapidly growing, ulcerated, pigmented mass. The histological features include atypical melanocytes invading the deeper layers of the epithelium and underlying connective tissue.

Oral melanocytic nevus (C) is a benign proliferation of melanocytes typically found on the skin but can occur intraorally as well. It often appears as a well-circumscribed brownish pigmented macule or papule. Histologically, it shows nests or clusters of melanocytes within the epithelium or lamina propria without invasion.

Oral melanoacanthoma (D) is a rare reactive pigmented lesion that presents as a brown to black macule or papule. It is characterized by an increase in dendritic melanocytes throughout the epithelium without evidence of atypia or mitotic activity. It is most commonly found on the buccal mucosa.

Given the absence of clinical and histological features suggestive of malignancy and the presence of characteristic features of an oral melanotic macule, this is the most likely diagnosis.

B: Disseminated varicella zoster virus 

Explanation: The description and images provided suggest a vesicular rash in a neutropenic infant. The presence of scattered vesicles with an erythematous base and the distribution of the rash on the lower back and left thigh are consistent with disseminated varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. The punch biopsy specimen is likely to show characteristic findings, such as multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies. Additionally, testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV was ordered to rule out alternative causes.
D

838
Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis in this case is C: Neurocutaneous melanosis.

Explanation:
Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of multiple melanocytic nevi in the skin along with melanocytic lesions in the leptomeninges, brain, and other organs. The presence of multiple congenital nevi, along with the development of intracranial lesions over a decade, is suggestive of neurocutaneous melanosis. The progressive enlargement of the lesions in the left temporal lobe, along with the development of a mass in the third ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus, further support this diagnosis. Genetic examination showing a mutation in the N-ras-2 gene also suggests a melanocytic origin of the lesions. Metastatic melanoma is less likely as there is no history of tumors elsewhere. Primary intracranial melanoma and lymphoma are also less likely as they do not typically present with multiple parenchymal lesions evolving over a decade.
C

839
The correct answer is B: Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis). 

Explanation: Nicolau syndrome, also known as livedoid dermatitis or embolia cutis medicamentosa, is a rare complication that occurs following intramuscular injections. It is characterized by severe pain, purpura, and necrosis at the injection site. The symptoms usually develop shortly after the injection and can progress over time. The exact cause of Nicolau syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be a result of ischemic injury to the skin and underlying tissue due to injury to blood vessels.

In this case, the patient presented with severe pain and purpura at the site of injection, which worsened over time, leading to necrosis. The presence of retiform purpura and central black necrosis is consistent with the diagnosis of Nicolau syndrome. The lack of systemic symptoms such as fever or chills, normal blood test results, and intact pulses suggest that the underlying structures are not involved, ruling out other possible diagnoses such as pyomyositis, retained foreign body, or necrotizing fasciitis.

The treatment for Nicolau syndrome involves wound care and symptomatic management. It is important to prevent further tissue damage and infection. In severe cases, surgical debridement may be necessary. Close monitoring and follow-up are required to ensure proper healing and prevention of complications.

A: Perforated appendicitis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, voluntary guarding, and focal right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation, along with the laboratory findings of leukocytosis, is consistent with acute appendicitis. The abdominal ultrasonography images did not show the appendix and had no signs of inflammation, which can occur in cases of retrocecal appendicitis. The computed tomography images demonstrated an inflamed retrocecal mass, further supporting the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. The absence of the appendix on pelvic ultrasonography suggests that it may have already perforated. The patient should be scheduled for an appendectomy.
D
cellvalue empty
841
The correct answer is D: Descending necrotizing mediastinitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe substernal pain radiating to the left shoulder and back, along with swelling of the left side of her neck, suggests a potential complication of forceful coughing leading to an infection. The soft tissue swelling seen on physical examination and computed tomographic scan, as well as the presence of mediastinal edema and pleural effusions, are consistent with descending necrotizing mediastinitis. This is a rare but serious condition characterized by the rapid spread of infection and inflammation from the oropharynx or upper respiratory tract into the deep neck spaces and mediastinum.

A: Acute jugular thrombosis is less likely because there is no evidence of thrombosis or clot formation on the computed tomographic scan, and there are no signs of jugular vein distension or blood flow abnormalities described in the case.

B: Spontaneous chylothorax is less likely because the chest pain and neck swelling are not consistent with this condition. Spontaneous chylothorax usually presents with pleural effusions and chyle leakage into the pleural space, but it does not typically cause severe substernal pain or neck swelling.

C: Contained esophageal perforation is less likely because the barium swallow test showed no evidence of contrast extravasation, ruling out esophageal perforation as the cause of symptoms. Additionally, the combination of severe substernal pain, neck swelling, and radiographic findings is not typical for contained esophageal perforation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and computed tomographic findings is descending necrotizing mediastinitis, which requires prompt diagnosis and aggressive management, including surgical intervention and intravenous antibiotics.

C: Evaluate for systemic infectious disease.

Explanation: The initial presentation of headache, fever, neck stiffness, and elevated inflammatory markers such as leukocytosis and C-reactive protein, along with the findings of aseptic meningitis in cerebrospinal fluid studies, suggest an infectious etiology. The subsequent development of unilateral blurry vision and significant inflammation in the eyes raises concern for an ocular manifestation of the underlying infection. Therefore, it is important to further evaluate for a systemic infectious disease that may be causing both the meningitis and the ocular inflammation. Treatment decisions can be made based on the specific diagnosis, once the infectious etiology is identified.

C: Order computed tomography of the head/facial bones

Explanation: Given the deep midfacial laceration and the presence of a significant amount of clear fluid draining from the wound site, ordering a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and facial bones would be the next appropriate step. This would help assess the extent of the injury, determine if there are any underlying fractures or structural damage, and assist in planning the management approach. It is important to rule out any potential involvement of important structures such as the nasolacrimal system, which could be damaged in this case.

D: Infectious and autoimmune workup.

Explanation: The presence of retinal whitening with intraretinal hemorrhages and cystoid abnormalities on optical coherence tomography suggests an underlying pathology that requires further investigation. The differential diagnosis for these findings includes infectious and autoimmune etiologies. Therefore, obtaining more information about the patient's history and performing an infectious and autoimmune workup would be the appropriate next steps to identify the underlying cause of the retinal findings and guide further management.

845
B: Shorten the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds

Explanation: The patient's presentation with generalized weakness and fatigue could suggest pacemaker syndrome, which is typically caused by long AV delays. Shortening the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds can help improve the symptoms by allowing for more coordinated atrioventricular conduction and better synchronization of the cardiac chambers. Increasing the atrial pacing rate or the postventricular atrial refractory period would not directly address the potential issue of pacemaker syndrome. Referring the patient for pacemaker lead revision would be a more extreme intervention that should be considered if other measures fail.
B

846
B: Neutrophilic dermatoses

Explanation: The patient's presentation of multiple painful cutaneous nodules, along with a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, suggests the possibility of neutrophilic dermatoses. Neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of inflammatory skin conditions characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the skin. These conditions can occur in the setting of malignancies, such as multiple myeloma. The clinical features, including the scattered red-violaceous nodules that are fixed, firm, and tender to touch, along with the immunohistochemical analysis, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of high-risk genetic markers on cytogenetic analysis makes other possible diagnoses, such as plasmacytoma or leukemia cutis, less likely.

C: The patient does not meet criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Explanation: The patient's test results do not meet the criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The Aspergillus galactomannan test is commonly used for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis, but in this case, the test results are not positive. Additionally, there are no other signs or symptoms that support a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

A: Obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain.

Explanation: The presentation of a pink nodule on the cheek that has progressively grown over the years, along with symptoms of pruritus and occasional bleeding with minor trauma, suggests the possibility of a skin tumor. It is important to rule out malignancy or other pathological conditions. Therefore, obtaining a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain would provide histopathological information and help in confirming the diagnosis.

C: The patient may be using hydrocodone but is using cocaine.

Explanation: The urine drug screen detected the presence of cocaine, suggesting recent use. However, it did not detect the presence of hydrocodone, which could indicate that the patient is not using hydrocodone as prescribed. It is possible that the patient is using hydrocodone but it is not being detected by the drug screen, or the patient may not be taking hydrocodone as prescribed and is using cocaine instead. Further assessment and discussion with the patient is necessary to confirm and address this finding.

850
B: Results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Explanation: The presence of elevated titers of anticardiolipin and anti–β2 glycoprotein I antibodies suggests the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome. However, it is recommended to repeat the tests after 12 weeks to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any transient or false-positive results. This is because a single positive result may not be sufficient to establish a diagnosis, as the antibodies may be transient or due to other causes. Additionally, the negative lupus anticoagulant screening assays further support the need for repeated testing.
B

851
The most likely diagnosis for this case is C: Carcinoid syndrome.

Explanation: Carcinoid syndrome is a condition characterized by the presence of carcinoid tumors, which are neuroendocrine tumors that typically arise in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. These tumors can secrete various bioactive substances, including serotonin and histamine, leading to a wide range of symptoms. The patient's history of a pulmonary tumor and the diffuse expression of chromogranin A in the lung tumor cells support the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome.

The presenting features in this case, such as generalized phymatous changes affecting the entire face (leonine facies), pustular lesions, diffuse erythema, seborrheic hyperplasia, flushing episodes, and ocular manifestations, are consistent with the cutaneous manifestations seen in carcinoid syndrome. Additionally, the history of intense diarrhea and the presence of metastatic hepatic masses on the CT scan further support the diagnosis, as bowel involvement and liver metastases are common in carcinoid syndrome.

Leprosy (A) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and typically presents with skin lesions, nerve damage, and multisystem involvement, but it does not typically cause the specific cutaneous manifestations seen in this case.

Mastocytosis (B) is a disorder characterized by an excessive number of mast cells in the skin and other organs. While mast cell activation can cause flushing episodes, the other features in this case, such as leonine facies, pustular lesions, and seborrheic hyperplasia, are not characteristic of mastocytosis.

Leishmaniasis (D) is a parasitic infection transmitted by sandflies and can cause a variety of cutaneous manifestations, including ulcers, nodules, and skin discoloration. However, the specific features in this case, such as leonine facies, pustular lesions, and seborrheic hyperplasia, are not typical of leishmaniasis.

852
The correct answer is B: IgA pemphigus.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of annular flaccid pustules on the trunk, along with subcorneal acantholysis of keratinocytes and discrete subcorneal intercellular IgA depositions seen on histopathology, suggests IgA pemphigus. This is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the presence of IgA antibodies targeting desmoglein 1 and/or desmoglein 3, leading to acantholysis and blister formation. Tinea corporis (A) is a superficial fungal infection causing ring-shaped lesions, but without the characteristic histopathological findings or subcorneal IgA deposition seen in this case. Duhring disease (C) refers to dermatitis herpetiformis, which typically presents with clusters of pruritic vesicles or papules on extensor surfaces and is associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, the histopathological findings in this case do not support the diagnosis. Psoriasis pustulosa (D) usually presents with sterile pustules on erythematous plaques, but the annular configuration and the presence of subcorneal IgA deposition are not consistent with this diagnosis.
B

853
A: Mucormycosis

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a gray-violet plaque, low white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and the presence of broad nonseptate hyphae in histopathologic analysis and fungal culture are consistent with mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungi from the Mucorales order, which includes the genus Rhizopus. Immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, are particularly susceptible to this infection. The classic histologic findings of mucormycosis include invasion of blood vessels by nonseptate (or pauciseptate) hyphae. Treatment typically involves surgical debridement and the administration of antifungal agents such as amphotericin B.

854
D: Herpes simplex virus.

Explanation: The presence of grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a neonate, along with the history of respiratory distress and maternal rupture of membranes, raises suspicion for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Neonatal HSV infection can occur in three different forms: localized, disseminated, and central nervous system. The most common presentation is localized infection, characterized by cutaneous vesicles, as seen in this case. Systemic symptoms, such as respiratory distress and abnormal liver enzymes, further support the diagnosis of disseminated infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with intravenous acyclovir are crucial to prevent severe complications and neurologic sequelae.
D
cellvalue empty
855
Answer: B: Tuberculous mastitis 

Explanation: The patient presents with a sudden and painful enlargement of the upper quadrants of the left breast, edema, palpable axillary lymph nodes, and fatigue. The absence of fever, skin redness, trauma to the breast, and signs of inflammation or infection makes it unlikely to be inflammatory breast cancer (A) or mastitis caused by immunosuppression (D). The patient's history of stopping breastfeeding and recent history of pneumonia self-medicated with antibiotics are not typical of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (C).

Breast ultrasonography shows diffuse nonspecific hypoechogenicity of the breast tissue with periductal small cysts, which is consistent with tuberculous mastitis. The multiple biopsies and fine-needle aspiration cytologic testing of an enlarged lymph node revealed granulomatous inflammation, further supporting the diagnosis of tuberculous mastitis.

The blood tests, including negative results for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus, as well as normal lymph nodes, help rule out other causes and support the diagnosis of tuberculous mastitis. The patient's positive IgG cytomegalovirus and normal blood parameters (fibrinogen level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocyte count) are not relevant to the diagnosis of tuberculous mastitis.
C

856
The answer is C: Pheochromocytoma.

Explanation: 
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are rare adrenal gland tumors that can also occur in the retroperitoneum. They are typically hypervascular and can have dilated tortuous blood supply. The slight elevation in normetanephrine levels found on laboratory evaluation is also suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Additionally, the absence of systemic symptoms, pain, urinary symptoms, or abnormal bowel function, as well as the patient's history of decreased appetite, are consistent with a non-functional pheochromocytoma. The decision to perform preoperative arterial embolization to minimize intraoperative blood loss further supports the likelihood of a highly vascular tumor like pheochromocytoma.

857
C: Observe and repeat spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year

Explanation: Based on the given information, the patient has a history of Alport syndrome and recently experienced herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which can cause inflammation and vision problems. The examination findings show superficial keratitis and anterior stromal haze in the right eye, irregular foveal contour, and subtle flecking of the retina in both eyes. However, there are no other abnormalities found on examination. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) also does not show any significant abnormalities such as epiretinal membrane formation or outer retinal changes in either eye.

Given the lack of significant findings and the absence of specific treatment indications, observation with repeat OCT in 6 months to 1 year is a reasonable approach. This allows for monitoring of any changes or progression in the retinal condition and can guide further management decisions if needed. Performing pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling or injecting foscarnet intravitreally would be more invasive and are not warranted at this time. Intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin is not indicated based on the given information. Aqueous/vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction and inject foscarnet intravitreally is also not necessary as there are no indications of active viral infection.

858
Option D: Start systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery.

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including the clouding in her vision, jaw pain, fatigue with chewing, weight loss, and a history of smoking, suggests temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis). This is a vasculitis that affects medium and large arteries, particularly the superficial temporal arteries. Given the potential severity of this condition and the risk of vision loss, immediate treatment is warranted. Starting systemic corticosteroids is the recommended first-line treatment for temporal arteritis. A biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is also important to confirm the diagnosis. Other options such as observation and smoking cessation or obtaining a hypercoagulable laboratory workup are not appropriate in this case. Diagnostic vitreous paracentesis and intravitreal antibiotic injection would not be indicated as there is no evidence of infection.

859
C: Systemic workup for occult malignancy

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a circumscribed elevation of the iris, intermittent shooting pain, and presence of similar lesions in other quadrants raises concern for a potential malignancy. Given the atypical findings, it would be prudent to perform a systemic workup to rule out any underlying occult malignancy. This may involve further imaging studies, blood tests, and consultation with other specialists if necessary. Observing and repeating imaging in 6 months may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment if there is an underlying malignancy. Lesion biopsy and attempting lesion rupture with laser should be considered after ruling out malignancy and a proper diagnosis has been established.

A: Observe

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a retrobulbar hematoma. The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with an orbital compartment syndrome, which was likely caused by barotrauma during scuba diving. However, since the patient's visual acuity has returned to normal and there are no signs of optic nerve compromise, conservative management with observation is appropriate. The patient should be instructed to report any worsening of symptoms or new onset visual changes, and a follow-up examination should be scheduled to monitor for any progression of symptoms or development of complications.

C: Place an emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker

Explanation: The patient's change in rhythm, specifically the development of bradycardia, is a concerning finding. Given the patient's history of GVHD and the recent flare-up of skin lesions, it is possible that the bradycardia could be related to cardiac involvement of GVHD. Additionally, the fact that the patient is asymptomatic does not rule out the need for intervention as bradycardia can be a sign of physiological decompensation. An emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker should be placed to stabilize the patient's heart rate and prevent potential complications.

862
The correct answer is A: Rhabdomyoma.

Explanation:
The patient presented with symptoms of progressive nocturnal dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and weight loss. The laryngeal examination revealed a well-mucosalized mass originating from the left pyriform sinus, with mass effect on the larynx. A computed tomographic scan confirmed the presence of a nonenhancing, well-circumscribed laryngeal mass. 

Microscopic examination of the mass showed polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations, which is consistent with the diagnosis of rhabdomyoma. Rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor composed of skeletal muscle cells and is rare in the head and neck region. 

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, dysphonia, nocturnal dyspnea, and weight loss are likely a result of the mass effect of the rhabdomyoma on the larynx. Treatment with transoral carbon dioxide laser–assisted excision resulted in improvement in the patient's symptoms.

None of the other answer options (B: Granular cell tumor, C: Paraganglioma, D: Hibernoma) are consistent with the clinical and histopathological findings described in the case.
A
863
The correct answer is D: Sweet syndrome.

Explanation: Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by the sudden onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules with a central dusky appearance. It is often associated with an underlying systemic condition, including hematologic malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this case, the patient has recently been diagnosed with AML and is presenting with fever, neutropenia, and characteristic skin lesions following a scratch from his pet cat. The histopathology of the skin biopsy showing a brisk neutrophilic infiltrate also supports the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. Other potential causes such as Fusarium species or Bartonella henselae infections are less likely given the clinical presentation and lack of evidence for systemic involvement. Leukemia cutis, characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin, is another possible differential diagnosis but is less likely in this case due to the absence of the typical leukemic cells on histopathology.

C: The patient has depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity.

Explanation: The given information states that the patient has a history of major depressive disorder and is currently experiencing increased hopelessness, insomnia, and decreased energy. The total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was 16, indicating the presence of depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity. This suggests that the patient's depression has worsened, possibly due to the recent death of his husband. Based on this information, we can interpret that the patient has depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity.

865
B: Evaluate for systemic vasculitis

Explanation:
Given the clinical presentation of widespread purpuric macules and papules, along with the skin biopsy findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, it is important to consider the possibility of systemic vasculitis. Systemic vasculitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body, which can manifest with various skin findings. Further evaluation, such as laboratory tests and potentially imaging studies, is necessary to determine if there is systemic involvement and to help identify the underlying cause. Prescribing prednisone or a topical glucocorticoid may provide symptomatic relief but would not address the underlying condition. Providing reassurance and observation alone would not be appropriate considering the chronicity of the lesions and the potential for systemic involvement.

The correct answer is D: X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder.

Explanation: X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder, also known as X-linked cutaneous amyloidosis, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males. It is characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation, often starting in childhood and progressively worsening over time. The hyperpigmentation typically covers the trunk and extremities.

Hypohidrosis, or reduced ability to sweat, is a common feature of X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder. This can lead to increased susceptibility to heat intolerance and recurrent sinopulmonary infections.

In this case, the patient's family history of similarly affected men on the mother's side is suggestive of X-linked inheritance. A punch biopsy specimen is obtained to confirm the diagnosis, and can show features of amyloid deposition on Congo red staining.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (choice D).

The correct answer is D: Erythema dyschromicum perstans.

Explanation: Erythema dyschromicum perstans is a rare, chronic, acquired pigmentary disorder typically characterized by asymptomatic macules and patches of varying sizes, most commonly affecting the face and neck, but can also involve the trunk and extremities. The lesions are usually blue-gray or dark brown in color and can be found symmetrically distributed. The exact cause of erythema dyschromicum perstans is unknown, but it is thought to have an autoimmune or hypersensitivity component. Histologically, there may be a lichenoid infiltrate in the upper dermis, but these findings are not specific. Treatment options for erythema dyschromicum perstans are limited and often not effective.

My diagnosis is C: Xanthoma disseminatum.

Explanation: Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the development of multiple yellow-brown to red-brown papules on various body sites, including the eyelids, axillae, inguinal folds, and flexural areas. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and may be associated with systemic symptoms such as polydipsia, polyuria, and nocturia, as seen in this case. Histopathological examination reveals foamy histiocytes within the dermis. Xanthogranuloma and Erdheim-Chester disease are also histiocytic disorders but do not match the clinical and histopathological features described in this case. Generalized eruptive histiocytoma is a benign cutaneous histiocytosis characterized by sudden onset of small red-brown papules, but it typically spares the eyelids and does not present with systemic symptoms.

B: Dyshidrotic eczema 

Explanation: The clinical presentation of tense bullae on the palms and macerated plaques on the dorsal feet is consistent with dyshidrotic eczema. This condition is characterized by the development of small, fluid-filled blisters on the hands and/or feet. Dyshidrotic eczema is a form of eczema that typically occurs in individuals with a history of atopic dermatitis, which this patient has. The negative results on testing for herpes simplex virus, bacterial infection, and fungal infection (tinea) also support the diagnosis of dyshidrotic eczema. Bullous pemphigoid is a blistering autoimmune disease that primarily affects elderly individuals and typically presents with bullae on the trunk and extremities. Distal blistering dactylitis is a bacterial infection characterized by blisters and redness around the fingers or toes, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.

My diagnosis is: C: Mucocele of the appendix.

Explanation: The presence of a large intra-abdominal cystic mass in the right iliac fossa, as seen on the computed tomography (CT) scan, suggests a mucocele of the appendix. The history of abdominal discomfort and a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa further supports this diagnosis. The absence of intraluminal mucosal abnormalities or masses on colonoscopy, along with the evidence of external compression at the cecum, also points towards a mucocele of the appendix rather than cecal carcinoma or appendix abscess. Neuroendocrine tumors typically present with specific symptoms and are less likely in this case.

871
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is C: Afferent loop syndrome.

Explanation: Afferent loop syndrome occurs when there is obstruction or dilation of the afferent loop, which is the portion of small intestine that carries bile and pancreatic secretions from the bile and pancreatic ducts to the reconstructed digestive system after a Whipple procedure. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In this case, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with afferent loop syndrome, as there is a tubular solid structure within the distended stomach, representing the dilated afferent loop. The elevated lipase level is also indicative of pancreatic involvement.

Tumor recurrence (A) is a possibility, but in this case, the imaging findings are more suggestive of afferent loop syndrome. Marginal ulcer (B) is less likely as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not typical. Internal hernia (D) is also less likely, as there is no evidence of bowel obstruction or hernia on physical examination or imaging.

C: Perform a biopsy of the lesion.

Explanation: Given the history of ocular graft-vs-host disease and the presence of a new conjunctival lesion, performing a biopsy of the lesion would be the most appropriate next step. A biopsy can help determine the nature of the lesion, whether it is benign or malignant, and guide further management. It is important to rule out potential malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma or lymphoma, which can occur in patients with chronic graft-vs-host disease.

C: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy, followed by observation if the results are consistent with a benign mixed tumor.

Explanation: The patient presents with a gradually enlarging orbital mass with signs of proptosis and limited extraocular motility. The imaging findings suggest a well-circumscribed solid soft tissue mass in the superotemporal left orbit. Given the presentation and imaging findings, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy is the next appropriate step to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis. This will help determine the nature of the mass and guide further management decisions. If the biopsy results are consistent with a benign mixed tumor, observation may be considered as these tumors are typically slow-growing and can be managed conservatively.

C: Discuss the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy.

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings and imaging results, the patient's symptoms and bilateral macular lesions are concerning for a posterior uveitis or choroiditis. In such cases, oral corticosteroid therapy is often considered as a treatment option. Oral corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects and can help reduce the inflammation and associated swelling in the affected tissues, potentially improving visual outcomes.

However, initiating oral corticosteroid therapy should be done after a thorough discussion of the potential risks and benefits with the patient. Corticosteroids are associated with various side effects, including systemic effects such as increased blood sugar levels, weight gain, mood changes, and increased susceptibility to infections. Additionally, long-term corticosteroid use can lead to more serious complications like osteoporosis, cataracts, and glaucoma.

Ultimately, the decision to start oral corticosteroid therapy should be made in collaboration with the patient, taking into account their medical history, overall health, and the severity of their symptoms. Close monitoring and regular follow-up visits should be planned to assess the response to treatment and monitor for any adverse effects.

Given the patient's symptoms of facial tingling, pulsatile tinnitus, acute-onset blurry vision, altered color perception, paracentral scotomas, and the presence of large, pale-yellowish placoid lesions within the macula of both eyes, a possible diagnosis of neurosyphilis should be considered. Neurosyphilis can present with symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure and chorioretinal lesions.

Performing a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) testing can help confirm the diagnosis of syphilis. A positive RPR test indicates the presence of antibodies against syphilis, while FTA-ABS testing can confirm the specificity of the antibodies.

Once the diagnosis of neurosyphilis is confirmed, appropriate treatment with intravenous or intramuscular penicillin should be initiated.

A: Perform direct current cardioversion followed by coronary angiography.

Explanation: Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) with a ventricular rate of 135 beats/min and a history of chest pain and dyspnea suggests possible myocardial ischemia. The immediate management of unstable WCT is synchronized direct current cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm and improve hemodynamics. After cardioversion, coronary angiography should be performed to evaluate for any underlying coronary artery disease as a potential cause of the WCT. This will help determine the need for revascularization or other interventions to address the underlying ischemic etiology.

The answer option would be D: The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's 24-hour urine studies showed elevated levels of urine calcium (calcium excretion >250 mg/day), which indicates hypercalciuria. The patient's serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, bicarbonate, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone were all within the normal range, ruling out other potential causes of hypercalciuria such as primary hyperparathyroidism or renal insufficiency. Additionally, the patient's stone analysis showed predominantly calcium oxalate stones, which is consistent with idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Distal renal tubular acidosis (a) typically presents with a combination of hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and metabolic acidosis, which is not observed in this case. High animal protein intake (b) can increase urinary calcium excretion, but this patient's typical daily consumption of animal protein is within a normal range. High salt intake (c) is not typically associated with hypercalciuria. Therefore, idiopathic hypercalciuria is the most likely explanation for the patient's recurrent nephrolithiasis and elevated urine calcium levels.

878
B: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are indicative of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. This type of tumor typically presents as a firm, nonencapsulated mass within the parotid gland. Microscopically, it is characterized by spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern and infiltration of lymphohistiocytic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis typically shows positivity for Alk-1, vimentin, CD68, and factor XIIIa, and negativity for smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, cytokeratin, and CD34.
B
879
The answer is C: Plasmablastic lymphoma. 

Explanation: Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is strongly associated with HIV infection. It typically presents as an aggressive and rapidly growing mass in the oral cavity, particularly in the gingiva. The histologic features include a dual population of lymphoma cells with plasmablasts and "plasmacytic" cells. Immunohistochemical expression of CD138 and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small nuclear RNA (EBV-EBER) is commonly seen. The high Ki-67 index indicates a high rate of mitotic division. Flow cytometry is often noncontributory in differentiating plasmablastic lymphoma from other lymphomas. Other lymphoma types (Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and Kaposi sarcoma can be ruled out based on the immunophenotype findings.
C
880
The correct answer is C: Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient's presentation is consistent with an ectopic hamartomatous thymoma. This rare tumor typically presents as a painless mass in the supraclavicular region, as seen in this case. The presence of a heterogeneous and cystic mass on contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging, along with hypermetabolism on positron emission tomography, further support this diagnosis. The histopathologic examination revealing an irregular combination of squamous epithelial and spindle cells, along with a mature adipose tissue component, is consistent with an ectopic hamartomatous thymoma. Immunohistochemical analysis showing diffuse positivity for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 supports the diagnosis as well. Synovial sarcoma typically presents as a soft tissue mass with histopathologic features different from the findings in this case. Cervical neurilemmoma and pleomorphic adenoma are less likely given the specific clinical and imaging features described.
C
881
C: Sinonasal mucosal melanoma.

Explanation: The patient in this case presented with unilateral nasal congestion, epistaxis, and a nasal mass that failed to respond to typical treatments. The CT scan showed opacification of the right nasal cavity and sinuses, and the histopathologic analysis revealed sheets of atypical, pleomorphic epithelioid cells with prominent pigmentation. The immunohistochemical stains were positive for HMB-45 and S-100, which are markers commonly seen in melanomas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is sinonasal mucosal melanoma (option C).
C
882
I would choose option C: Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, abnormal white blood cell count with a high percentage of blasts, and low platelet count suggest a hematologic malignancy, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A bone marrow biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the subtype of AML. This information is crucial for guiding the appropriate treatment plan. Options A and B involve initiating specific AML treatments (all-trans retinoic acid and cytarabine/daunorubicin chemotherapy, respectively), but these should be discussed with a hematologist after confirming the diagnosis. Option D, placing a central venous catheter for blood product replacement, may be necessary but should not be the immediate next step in management.

883
Answer: B: Pheochromocytoma; proceed with imaging studies.

Explanation: The symptoms of paroxysmal palpitations, flushing, pale complexion, and diaphoresis, along with the elevated metanephrines in the laboratory tests, are suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and can produce excess catecholamines, leading to the characteristic symptoms. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, are necessary to localize the tumor before considering further management options.

884
B: Perform a needle biopsy 

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation of a soft-tissue mass on the upper maxillary gingiva that has been increasing in size and bleeding, performing a needle biopsy is the next appropriate step. A needle biopsy would provide a tissue sample for histological examination, allowing for a definitive diagnosis. This is important in order to determine the nature of the mass and to guide further management and treatment decisions.
C
cellvalue empty
885
B: Order a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months.

Explanation: The next step in the management of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass is to determine its growth rate and stability. Given that the patient is asymptomatic and the initial CT scan findings are not highly suggestive of malignancy, ordering a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months would help evaluate the growth characteristics of the tumor. If the tumor remains stable or shows slow growth, it is less likely to be malignant. However, if there are significant changes in size or characteristics, further evaluation or intervention may be necessary.
C

886
The correct answer is C: Septic emboli.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with encephalopathy, recent falls, leukocytosis, nausea, arthralgias, and progressing cutaneous eruption is concerning for septic emboli. The scattered petechiae, palpable purpura, and hemorrhagic vesicles seen, with the bulla on the left wrist, are all consistent with cutaneous manifestations of septic emboli. The skin biopsy specimens showing vascular thrombosis with extramural fibrin deposition support the diagnosis.

Rat bite fever (A) is typically associated with fever, arthralgia, and rash following a bite from an infected rat, which does not correlate with the patient's presentation.

Rocky mountain spotted fever (B) is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, and a characteristic maculopapular rash. It typically presents with systemic symptoms and a rash that starts on the extremities and spreads centrally. This does not align with the patient's presentation.

Disseminated gonococcemia (D) can present with skin lesions, joint pain, and systemic symptoms. However, the absence of a history of sexual activity or genital symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely.

Overall, Septic emboli is the most probable diagnosis given the clinical findings.

The correct answer is D: Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a mass in the nostril with bleeding on minimal trauma is suggestive of a lesion that originates from the nasal vestibule. The skin-colored plaque with an exophytic and verrucous appearance further indicates a benign epithelial growth. The histologic findings of papillary fronds lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium, along with the presence of mucin-containing goblet cells, confirm the diagnosis of an exophytic Schneiderian papilloma, also known as an inverted papilloma. These tumors arise from the Schneiderian membrane and most commonly occur in the lateral nasal wall. They are typically benign but have the potential for local invasion and recurrence. Immediate treatment should involve complete surgical resection with close follow-up to monitor for recurrence.

My Diagnosis is: C: Sporotrichosis.

Explanation: The presentation of erythematous, crusted, edematous plaques and pustules on the left leg, with a sporotrichoid spread and an enlarged lymph node in the groin, is highly suggestive of sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii, commonly found in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. It is usually acquired through traumatic inoculation, such as a puncture wound or abrasion from thorns, hence the history of a small abrasion on the leg before wading in the lake. Sporotrichosis can initially be misdiagnosed as cellulitis or allergic contact dermatitis, as seen in this case. The potassium hydroxide scraping and tissue cultures are performed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment typically involves oral itraconazole or, in severe cases, intravenous amphotericin B.
D

889
The correct answer is B: Pustular psoriasis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of symmetrical erythematous plaques with superimposed small pustules at the periphery, along with associated desquamation, is characteristic of pustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent episodes of pustule formation on a background of erythematous plaques. The eruption tends to accentuate in certain areas such as the inguinal folds, antecubital fossae, and popliteal fossae. The biopsy findings of subcorneal pustules with underlying neutrophilic spongiosis, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, and edema of the papillary dermis further support the diagnosis of pustular psoriasis. Atopic dermatitis and clindamycin use may have triggered the onset of pustular psoriasis in this child. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (Answer A) typically presents as an acute eruption of nonfollicular pustules on an erythematous base, usually associated with fever and systemic symptoms. This condition is typically triggered by medications. Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Answer C) presents with recurrent episodes of fever, skin rash, and joint pain, typically starting in infancy. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (Answer D) typically presents with a diffuse erythematous rash with areas of epidermal desquamation resembling a scalded burn.

The correct answer is D: Metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with lytic lesions involving the sternum, second rib, and a large mass involving the right scapula, along with a history of progressing right shoulder pain and limited mobility, is suggestive of metastatic disease. The patient's comorbidities and smoking history further support this possibility. Giant cell tumor (A) and giant cell reparative granuloma (B) are primary bone tumors, typically benign, and are not associated with metastatic disease. Brown tumor (C) is a focal osteolytic lesion associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal failure or primary hyperparathyroidism. Given the known history and imaging findings, metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary is the most likely diagnosis.
C

891
Answer: C: A recurrent herpetic whitlow.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a painful vesicle appearing after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion is consistent with a herpetic whitlow. Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection caused by either the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2). It can occur in healthcare workers who come into contact with infected oral or genital secretions. The initial trauma and disruption of the epidermal barrier provided an entry point for the virus. Recurrence of lesions at the same site is characteristic of herpetic whitlow. Treatment typically involves antiviral medications such as acyclovir or valacyclovir.

892
B: Refer the patient to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation

Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral decreased vision, hyperemic discs, macular edema, subretinal fluid, and flame-shaped hemorrhages without evidence of microaneurysms or exudates is consistent with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Additionally, the patient's decreased protein S level and heterozygosity in the factor V Leiden mutation indicates a possible hypercoagulable state. Considering these findings, it is important to refer the patient to a hematology service for further evaluation and possible anticoagulation therapy, as treating the underlying hypercoagulable state may help prevent future vascular occlusive events. Rendering an intravitreous injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (Option A) or performing panretinal photocoagulation (Option D) would not address the underlying hypercoagulable state and may not be necessary at this stage. Observing the patient (Option C) without further intervention could potentially lead to irreversible vision loss if the hypercoagulable state is not addressed.
B
cellvalue empty
893
The correct answer is B: Mucocele.

Explanation: The patient presented with symptoms of blurred vision and gait instability, along with headache and nasal congestion. The CT scan and MRI revealed an expansile mass in the left petrous apex and sphenoid sinus. The mass appeared heterogeneous on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, indicating the presence of fluid. Additionally, the mass did not enhance with gadolinium. These findings are consistent with a mucocele, which is a benign, cystic lesion caused by the obstruction or destruction of sinus outflow tracts, leading to accumulation of mucus or secretions. The cystic nature and the golden-brown fluid encountered during surgery further support the diagnosis of a mucocele.
A
894
The correct answer is D: Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone.

Explanation: This patient's symptoms of painless otorrhea, aural fullness, and hearing loss, along with the finding of near-complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells on CT scan, are highly suggestive of a temporal bone pathology. The histopathologic examination revealed numerous small basophilic cells that were positive for CD20 and negative for CD3 immunostaining. These findings are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) of the temporal bone. LCH is a rare neoplastic disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are bone marrow-derived immune cells. LCH can involve various organs, including the temporal bone. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the involved tissue, followed by systemic therapy with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs.
B
895
The answer is D: Osteosarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with long-standing allergic rhinitis, progressive periorbital edema, proptosis, nasal congestion, altered sense of smell, and intermittent supraorbital pain along with the imaging findings of extensive thickening of the frontal bone, soft-tissue changes in the frontal sinus, and hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted MRI images support the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that can involve the frontal bone and extend into the adjacent structures. Pathologic evaluation demonstrating bony spaces containing lobules and whorls of spindle cells further supports this diagnosis. Intraosseous meningioma, mucocele, and fibrous dysplasia can all present with similar imaging findings, but the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings in this case are more consistent with osteosarcoma.
A
896
B: Parapharyngeal abscess

Explanation: The patient's sudden onset of left-sided neck swelling, pain, and progressive respiratory distress, along with the presence of trismus, rightward tracheal deviation, and a hoarse voice, suggests the presence of an abscess in the parapharyngeal space. The CT scan showing a large hyperdense mass between the left common carotid artery and the hypopharynx further supports this diagnosis. The presence of periapical dental abscesses also suggests a possible source of infection that could have spread to the parapharyngeal space.
A
897
C: Serologic testing

Explanation: Given the patient's history of HIV, presenting symptoms, and findings on ocular examination, the most appropriate next step would be to perform serologic testing. This would help to determine if there is an infectious etiology underlying the patient's acute monocular vision loss. Serologic testing may include tests for syphilis (such as non-treponemal and treponemal tests), toxoplasmosis, and other infectious causes that can potentially affect the retina and cause vision loss in immunocompromised individuals. Depending on the results of serologic testing, further management options can be considered.

898
B: Order bacterial and fungal blood cultures

Explanation: The presentation of acute-onset bilateral decreased vision and peripapillary retinal whitening requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause. A potential etiology could be an infectious process, such as endophthalmitis or ocular toxoplasmosis. Ordering bacterial and fungal blood cultures would help identify any systemic infection that may be contributing to the retinal findings. Additionally, other laboratory investigations may be warranted depending on the results of the blood cultures.

899
B: Initiate radiation therapy with plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy 

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient presents with a pigmented iridociliary lesion and increased intraocular pressure. There is no evidence of metastatic disease in other organs. The next appropriate step would be to initiate radiation therapy with plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy. These treatment options are commonly used for localized intraocular tumors and can provide effective local control. A transvitreal biopsy would carry the risk of tumor dissemination and is generally not recommended for suspected melanomas. Iridocyclectomy and enucleation with orbital implant are more invasive surgical options and are usually considered after other treatment modalities have been exhausted or if there is evidence of tumor growth or metastasis beyond the eye.

The answer is A: The patient is more likely to have a worse prognosis.

Explanation: The presence of a FLT3 mutation, specifically an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in this case, is associated with a worse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. FLT3 mutations are commonly found in AML and are associated with a higher relapse rate and shorter overall survival. In this particular case, the length of the ITD (44 base pairs) does not necessarily impact the prognosis, as even small mutations can have significant clinical implications. Gene sequencing may be needed to further characterize the FLT3 mutation and provide additional prognostic information, but the presence of the mutation alone already suggests a worse prognosis.

901
I would choose option C: Perform direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a nonblanchable purpuric rash, along with joint pain and a history of diverticulitis, suggests the possibility of an underlying systemic vasculitis. The DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy can help confirm the presence of vasculitis by identifying immune complexes and complement deposition in the blood vessels. This test can help guide further management and treatment decisions. Checking serologies for hepatitis, HIV, parvovirus, and streptococcal infections may be considered later, but the DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy is a more immediate and specific diagnostic step. Prescribing steroids with a slow tapering regimen (option D) may be appropriate if a diagnosis of vasculitis is confirmed. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing (option B) may be considered if the DIF evaluation is inconclusive or if there is a suspicion of an underlying autoimmune condition.
C

902
The correct answer is A: The patient has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

Explanation: The presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation is highly suggestive of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). MPN is a group of disorders characterized by the overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow. Hepatic vein thrombosis is a known complication of MPN. In this case, the patient's symptoms, the presence of ascites, and the imaging findings are consistent with MPN. The JAK2 V617F mutation is found in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, which are all subtypes of MPN. Therefore, the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation supports the diagnosis of MPN in this patient.

903
Based on the given information and the provided images, the most likely diagnosis for this case is D: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

Explanation: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare genetic connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormalities in the structure and production of collagen. This can lead to weak blood vessels, easy bruising, and thin, translucent skin. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa, a rare skin condition, can also be associated with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It presents as annular plaques surrounding atrophic patches, which match the clinical appearance described in the case. Histopathological examination, as shown in the images, can further support the diagnosis.

Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma (option A) typically presents with annular erythematous plaques and lacks the atrophic patches seen in this case.

Granuloma annulare (option B) presents with flesh-colored or erythematous papules or plaques, usually without atrophy.

Porokeratosis (option C) typically appears as annular plaques with a raised border and central atrophy, but it does not explain the additional findings of skin atrophy and easy bruising.

Therefore, the most fitting answer is D: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.
D
cellvalue empty
904
The answer is D: Patent urachus.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and histological findings, the diagnosis in this case is a patent urachus. A patent urachus is a congenital anomaly where the urachus, a remnant of the fetal bladder and allantois, fails to close after birth. It presents as a persistent communication between the bladder and umbilicus, leading to drainage of urine or mucous through the umbilicus. In this case, the red, bleeding umbilical mass and the histological findings of ulcerated epidermis, colonic mucosa, and granulation tissue support the diagnosis of a patent urachus.

Options A, B, and C are not consistent with the clinical presentation or histological findings in this case. Pyogenic granuloma is a common vascular lesion that typically presents as a bright red, friable papule, but it is not associated with colonic mucosa. Umbilical mucosal polyp would present as a pedunculated lesion, not a papule, and it would not have the ulcerated epidermis and colonic mucosa seen in the biopsy. Umbilical hernia is a separate entity, characterized by the protrusion of abdominal contents through an umbilical defect, and it would not have the same clinical or histological features as seen in this case.
B
cellvalue empty
905
C: Amyloidosis 
Explanation: The clinical presentation of progressive purpura in a long-term care patient, along with the presence of waxy yellow papules and plaques, suggests the possibility of underlying amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of fibrillar proteins, called amyloid, in various organs and tissues. The abnormal protein deposition can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations, including skin findings such as purpura and yellowish discoloration. The biopsy findings, specifically the positive staining with Congo red and apple-green birefringence under polarized microscopy, confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis. The absence of abnormal protein on serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis rules out other conditions such as myeloma or leukemic infiltration. Metastatic disease would typically show different histological features.
C

906
The correct diagnosis is C: Neurosarcoidosis.

Explanation: Neurosarcoidosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of granulomas (inflammatory nodules) in the nervous system. It can affect the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the nervous system. In this case, the patient presents with progressive quadriplegia, urinary retention, and impaired sensation below the nipples, indicating spinal cord involvement.

The presence of multiple intramedullary lesions with enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine is consistent with neurosarcoidosis. Additionally, enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and axillary regions, as seen on pulmonary computed tomography, suggest systemic involvement.

The patient's dry skin and pigmentation at the T2 vertebrae may be indicative of cutaneous sarcoidosis, which is often associated with neurosarcoidosis. The pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, and decreased glucose level in the cerebrospinal fluid further support the diagnosis, although no organisms were identified on staining.

The negative results for tuberculosis, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus help to exclude other potential causes. Mycotic meningomyelitis, tubercular meningomyelitis, and central nervous system lymphoma are less likely as they do not fit with the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case.

907
The answer is D: Oral lymphangioma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent painless tongue masses that vary in size and progress to red-filled vesicles without bursting or bleeding is consistent with oral lymphangioma. Oral lymphangioma is a benign malformation of lymphatic vessels, characterized by the abnormal development and proliferation of lymphatic channels. These masses typically present at birth or in early childhood and can undergo episodes of growth and regression. The masses are usually pale, nontender, and located in the anterior portion of the tongue. The absence of symptoms such as fever or other rashes, as well as the lack of airway obstruction, further support this diagnosis.

908
The answer is D: Colonic ileus/colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie syndrome).

Explanation: The patient's presentation with progressive abdominal distension, tenderness, and tympanic abdomen on physical examination, along with the findings on the plain abdominal radiograph showing a large colonic distension, are consistent with colonic ileus/colonic pseudoobstruction. Ogilvie syndrome is a condition characterized by acute large-bowel dilation in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It typically occurs in debilitated and bedridden patients with multiple comorbidities, such as the patient described in the case. The computed tomography scan with multiplanar reconstruction can be used to confirm the diagnosis by ruling out mechanical obstruction. Cecal volvulus and sigmoid volvulus are types of mechanical bowel obstruction, but the presentation and radiographic findings in this case are not consistent with these conditions. Aerophagia is the excessive swallowing of air, leading to gas accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is unlikely to cause such a severe and acute bowel dilation as seen in this patient.
C
cellvalue empty
909
Answer: B: Small-bowel intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with sudden onset of severe epigastric pain, fever, emesis, and inability to pass stool or flatus. The abdominal examination revealed a distended and tympanic abdomen with tenderness, guarding, and rebound in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant. The upright abdominal plain radiograph showed a distended, thickened stomach and multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, indicating small bowel obstruction. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a focal area of mixed fat density in the distal small bowel, suggesting a lead point with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding.

Given the patient's history of previous abdominal surgeries, including a hysterectomy and salpingo-oopherectomy, it is likely that pelvic adhesions have developed. Pelvic adhesions can cause small-bowel intussusception by creating a lead point or acting as a point of traction. This can lead to bowel obstruction and the symptoms described by the patient.

Metastatic lung cancer (A) would not typically present with acute abdominal symptoms and distended bowel loops on imaging. Phytobezoar (C) refers to a mass of indigestible plant material trapped in the gastrointestinal tract and is not supported by the clinical presentation or imaging findings. Endometriosis (D) can cause pelvic pain and bowel symptoms, but it is unlikely to cause the specific findings seen in this case.
C

910
I would choose option D: Percutaneous coronary intervention of the total RCA occlusion.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, EKG findings, and stress test results indicate significant ischemia in the right coronary artery (RCA) territory. The retrograde filling of the RCA from the pulmonary artery suggests a congenital anomaly, which may further compromise blood flow to the RCA. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would be the most appropriate next step to open the total occlusion in the RCA and restore blood flow, thereby relieving the ischemia and reducing the risk of further cardiac events. Medical therapy alone may not be sufficient in this case, and surgical options such as transposition of the RCA or left internal mammary artery grafting are not indicated unless PCI fails.

911
Answer: C

Explanation: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is likely related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a). This is because individuals with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia) have increased levels of these particles, which can interfere with the accuracy of calculated LDL measurements. In this case, the patient's persistent elevated LDL-C levels despite statin therapy suggest the presence of these lipid abnormalities. Further testing, such as measuring apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]), can help confirm this hypothesis.
The correct answer is C: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathological features described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that exhibits features of both neural and myogenic differentiation.

In this case, the patient presented with a slow-growing infiltrative sinonasal mass, accompanied by swelling, tenderness, proptosis, and intermittent epistaxis. The mass was located in the ethmoid sinus with involvement of the anterior skull base, anterior cribriform plate, and right medial orbit. The MRI showed vascularity and early intracranial involvement without invasion into the meninges or brain.

Histopathologically, the tumor showed infiltrative, low-grade behavior and exhibited spindle cells in a fascicular pattern, along with invagination of respiratory-type epithelium. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of BCL2 and S-100 protein, as well as focal immunoreactivity for smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35. Nonreactive immunostains included CD31, CD34, EMA, and CD99.

The other options are less likely based on the described clinical features and immunostaining profile. Low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor would typically show strong immunoreactivity for S-100 protein and no smooth muscle marker expression. Monophasic synovial sarcoma typically shows characteristic SS18 gene rearrangements on molecular testing, which was not mentioned in the case. Glomangiopericytoma is usually more localized and lacks the invasive features described in this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, and immunohistochemical profile, the most likely diagnosis is biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.
C
913
The correct answer is C: Osteosarcoma.

Explanation:
The MRI findings in this case are consistent with osteosarcoma. Osteosarcomas are aggressive malignant tumors that arise from the bone and can occur in the jaw. On MRI, osteosarcomas typically appear as a mass with heterogeneous signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, along with avid enhancement after contrast administration. The diffusion-weighted image in this case showing marked diffusion restriction is also suggestive of a malignant process.

Plasmacytoma is a rare plasma cell tumor that can affect the jawbones, but it usually presents as a well-defined lytic lesion with characteristic MRI findings. The lack of a lytic lesion and the presence of a mass with homogeneous signal intensity make plasmacytoma less likely in this case.

Ameloblastoma is a slow-growing benign odontogenic tumor that most commonly affects the posterior mandible. On MRI, ameloblastomas typically appear as a well-circumscribed, multilocular, and hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted images. The lack of multilocularity and the presence of avid enhancement make ameloblastoma less likely in this case.

Venous malformations are benign vascular lesions that can occur in the head and neck region. On MRI, venous malformations typically appear as well-defined lesions with intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The lack of vascular flow voids and the presence of marked diffusion restriction make venous malformation less likely in this case.
A
914
The correct answer is C: Acinic cell carcinoma.

Explanation: Acinic cell carcinoma typically presents as a slow-growing, painless, and non-tender mass in the parotid or submandibular gland. Fine-needle aspiration may be inconclusive in some cases, as seen in this patient. Computed tomography (CT) can help identify the location and characteristics of the mass. The histopathologic findings described in the case, such as the mixture of dark, granular basophilic acinar cells and eosinophilic intercalated ductal cells, along with the presence of intracytoplasmic granules and focal areas of hyaline sclerosis, are consistent with acinic cell carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor was confined within a periparotid lymph node, suggesting lymph node involvement. Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor but does not typically show the histopathologic findings described. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor but generally presents with clinical and histopathologic features different from the mentioned case. HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cyst is a benign condition associated with HIV infection and typically presents as multiple cystic masses rather than a single encapsulated nodule.

The correct answer is A: Esthesioneuroblastoma.

Explanation: Esthesioneuroblastoma, also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare malignant tumor that originates from the olfactory neuroepithelium. It typically presents with symptoms such as proptosis (bulging of the eye), decreased visual acuity, nasal obstruction, and epistaxis. In this case, the patient presented with progressive blurred vision, right ear pain, and subsequent right eye swelling and forehead tenderness, which are consistent with the symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma. The imaging findings further support this diagnosis, showing a mass in the right anterior nasal cavity invading the right orbit.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue tumor that typically presents in children and adolescents, commonly in the head and neck region. However, the symptoms and imaging findings described in this case are not characteristic of rhabdomyosarcoma.

Ethmoid mucocele is a benign cystic lesion that arises from the ethmoid sinus. While ethmoid mucoceles can cause proptosis and invasion into adjacent structures, they typically do not present with the rapid onset and progression of symptoms seen in this case.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare aggressive malignancy that arises in the sinonasal tract. It can invade surrounding structures, including the orbit, but the imaging findings and presenting symptoms described in this case are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is esthesioneuroblastoma.

C: Perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation of frequent headaches, blurry vision, bilateral optic disc swelling, macular exudates, subretinal fluid, and subretinal hemorrhages, as well as the presence of systemic hypertension and obesity, the leading differential diagnosis is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. IIH is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without apparent cause and can cause visual disturbances due to optic disc edema. The lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis is crucial to confirm the diagnosis of IIH by measuring the elevated opening pressure and ruling out other potential causes of optic disc edema. This diagnostic test is important in guiding the appropriate management and treatment plan for the patient.

The next step would be D: Refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting.

Explanation: A thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion may be helpful if there are associated findings or symptoms suggestive of an underlying condition. However, in this case, there were no other abnormalities reported on examination, indicating that an ocular adnexal evaluation may not be necessary at this time. Crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty is typically reserved for cases of advanced thinning or perforation, which is not indicated by the current findings. Subconjunctival injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medication may be considered in cases of progressive neovascularization or corneal pathology. However, in this case, refractive correction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting is a conservative treatment option to improve visual acuity and manage irregular astigmatism caused by the corneal thinning and deposits.

C: Preemptively treat the patient before his next dose of zoledronic acid.

Explanation: The patient developed severe bilateral photophobia, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, and blurred vision after receiving zoledronic acid infusion for Paget disease of the bone. These symptoms, along with the presence of subconjunctival hemorrhages and uveitic signs, indicate an ocular inflammatory reaction known as uveitis. Uveitis is a rare but known adverse effect of bisphosphonate treatment.

Given the potential for recurrence of uveitis with rechallenge, it is advisable to preemptively treat the patient before his next dose of zoledronic acid. This could involve prophylactic administration of corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory medications to prevent the development of uveitis. By taking this proactive approach, the patient's ocular symptoms and inflammation may be minimized or prevented altogether.

Answer: C: Perform bedside incision and drainage of the blisters and admit for intravenous antibiotics

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation of significant erythema, edema, and large blisters on the eyelids following a facial injury, along with systemic manifestations such as fever and cervical lymphadenopathy, it is important to address the possibility of an infection. The elevated white blood cell count with polymorphonuclear lymphocytes supports this suspicion. Therefore, performing bedside incision and drainage of the blisters would help to relieve tension, drain any purulent material, and potentially obtain a culture to guide antibiotic therapy.

Admitting the patient for intravenous antibiotics is crucial to providing appropriate treatment for a potential infection. This would allow for close monitoring of the patient's progress and the ability to adjust antibiotic therapy as needed. It is important to note that in cases where there is severe tissue destruction or necrosis, aggressive debridement in the operating room may be necessary, but this is not indicated in the given scenario.

920
The diagnosis for this case is C: Osteosarcoma metastasis.

Explanation: The patient had a history of high-grade osteosarcoma with areas of leiomyosarcoma of the tibia, which had been treated 4 years prior. The CT scan revealed a calcified left thyroid lobe mass, and PET-CT imaging showed increased uptake in the left thyroid gland. The neoplastic cells were positive for p53, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin, consistent with a metastasis from the previous osteosarcoma. The negative immunostains for S-100 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) rule out lymphoma and primary thyroid carcinoma, respectively. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is osteosarcoma metastasis.

C: Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

Explanation: Based on the symptoms described, the presence of the facial rash, fever, anemia, and abnormal laboratory findings, it is important to consider the possibility of a systemic autoimmune condition. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test helps in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, the presence of specific antibodies, such as anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies, can indicate the possibility of neonatal lupus erythematosus. These tests would provide valuable information in determining the underlying cause of the symptoms in both the infant and the mother.

922
The correct answer is B: Cutaneous malakoplakia.

Explanation: 
Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of granulomatous nodules, typically in the urogenital region. These nodules are often yellowish and can be ulcerated or eroded. They are caused by the deposition of calcium within macrophages, which results in the formation of so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Cutaneous malakoplakia is associated with immunosuppression and chronic inflammation. In this case, the patient has a history of chronic graft-vs-host disease post-bone marrow transplant and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The presence of yellow-colored nodules in the genital and perianal region is consistent with cutaneous malakoplakia. Therefore, option B is the correct diagnosis. Atypical mycobacterial infection (option A), cryptococcosis (option C), and calcinosis cutis (option D) are less likely in this case based on the clinical presentation and history provided.

923
D: Sarcoidosis arising in a tattoo.

Explanation: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect the skin. In this case, the patient presents with verrucous nodules in areas of the tattoo where pink pigment was used. This is characteristic of a granulomatous reaction, which can occur in sarcoidosis. The biopsy and tissue culture will help confirm the diagnosis. Other options such as hypertrophic discoid lupus, eruptive keratoacanthomas, and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia are less likely given the clinical presentation and examination findings.

The answer option is C: Rowell syndrome.

Explanation: Rowell syndrome, also known as lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome, is a rare autoimmune condition that presents with findings of both lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis. In this case, the patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is presenting with features of both acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ACLE) and dermatomyositis. The malar erythema, dyskeratosis seen on biopsy, presence of systemic symptoms (fever), and positive autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies, anti-Smith, antiribonucleoprotein, and SSA/anti-Ro) all support the diagnosis of Rowell syndrome. This syndrome is often characterized by target lesions and bullae, as seen in this case.

925
B: Demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including recurrent episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, limb weakness, and numbness, along with the presence of cerebral white matter lesions on MRI, suggest a demyelinating disease. Multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are both conditions characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system. These conditions often present with transient neurological deficits that can resolve spontaneously. The abnormal nerve conduction findings are consistent with demyelinating pathology. The normal results of laboratory examinations and absence of a significant family history of illness make other possibilities, such as periodic paralysis or X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, less likely in this case. Further diagnostic evaluation and consultation with a neurologist are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

926
The diagnosis is D: Cavernous sinus syndrome.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent diplopia, affecting eye movements in multiple directions, along with anisocoria, mild ptosis, and restricted eye movements seen on examination after eccentric gaze, suggest dysfunction of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus. The stable intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma on the left, as seen on the recent brain MRI, may be contributing to the symptoms. Cavernous sinus syndrome typically results from compression or infiltration of the cranial nerves and blood vessels within the cavernous sinus, which can be caused by various etiologies including tumors, inflammation, or vascular disorders. In this case, the patient's history of a pituitary macroadenoma and radiation treatment suggest a possible cause for the cavernous sinus syndrome.

927
The diagnosis is C: Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome.

Explanation: Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that typically affects older individuals who carry a premutation of the FMR1 gene. The presenting symptoms in this case, including severe action tremor in the dominant hand, subtle balance problems, and impaired executive function, are consistent with FXTAS. Other motor signs seen in this patient, such as abnormal handwriting, intention tremor, rigidity, and impaired coordination, further support this diagnosis.

The cognitive deficits observed in this patient, specifically executive dysfunction and slowed information processing, are common in FXTAS. The jerky eye pursuit, saccadic dysmetria, and slurring of speech seen on examination are also characteristic features of the disease.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in this case, including volume loss in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem, as well as abnormal signal intensity in the white matter of these areas, are consistent with FXTAS. The hyperintensities observed in the middle cerebellar peduncles on MRI are particularly suggestive of this condition.

The patient's medical history, family history of ischemic heart disease, lack of autonomic dysfunction symptoms, and the absence of other limb or resting tremors also point away from other potential diagnoses.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).

The correct answer is C: Dermoid cyst.

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the presence of a red patch on the lower back with an overlying soft nodule and pedunculated red papule is suggestive of a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are benign tumors that contain a variety of skin components, such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. They can occur anywhere on the body and may be present at birth. In this case, the normal prenatal screens and ultrasonography of the spine suggest that there is no underlying spinal dysraphism or teratoma. Hemangiomas typically present as raised, red or purple, vascular birthmarks, which do not match the description provided. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a dermoid cyst.

B: Begin rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day 

Explanation: The patient has severe hypercholesterolemia and primary sclerosing cholangitis, with a unique form of dyslipidemia known as lipoprotein X (LpX). The majority of the total cholesterol consists of free cholesterol instead of the usual esterified cholesterol. In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to begin treatment with rosuvastatin, a statin medication commonly used to reduce cholesterol levels. Therapeutic plasma exchange may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in severe cases, but starting with statin therapy is the first-line approach in treating severe hypercholesterolemia. Resolving obstructive cholestasis with biliary stent placement would address the biliary obstruction but would not directly target the underlying dyslipidemia.

B: Begin rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day.

Explanation: Based on the patient's history and laboratory findings, she has severe hypercholesterolemia, likely due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The presence of periorbital xanthelasmata, palmar xanthomata, and abnormal lipid profile (high unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids in large lipid-containing particles) suggest an underlying lipid disorder. Since genetic testing did not identify any rare mutations associated with abnormal lipid traits, the hypercholesterolemia in this patient is likely secondary to PSC.

Given the severity of her hypercholesterolemia, initiation of lipid-lowering therapy is warranted. Rosuvastatin, a potent statin, is appropriate in this case. Statins are the first-line agents for lowering cholesterol levels, and rosuvastatin has the ability to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol and improve lipid profiles.

Therapeutic plasma exchange may be considered in patients with severe dyslipidemias, but it is not the initial treatment choice in this case. Biliary stent placement is a treatment option for resolving obstructive cholestasis, but it does not address the underlying hypercholesterolemia.

Therefore, the best course of action at this stage would be to begin rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day, to manage the severe hypercholesterolemia in this patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Answer: C

Explanation: The next step would be to begin therapeutic plasma exchange in addition to initiating rosuvastatin therapy at a dose of 20 mg per day. The patient has severe hypercholesterolemia and has developed significant biliary obstruction, liver dysfunction, and clinical jaundice. Therapeutic plasma exchange, which involves removing large volumes of plasma and replacing it with a replacement fluid, can rapidly reduce the levels of lipoprotein X (LpX) and help alleviate biliary obstruction. Rosuvastatin, a potent statin, can also help lower cholesterol levels in the long term. A combination of these two interventions would be the most appropriate approach for this patient.

The correct answer is:

C: Facial nerve schwannoma

Explanation: The presentation of vertigo, hearing loss, facial nerve weakness, and a mass obstructing the external auditory canal, along with the findings on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showing erosion of surrounding bony structures and extension into the eustachian tube, are consistent with a middle ear schwannoma. Immunohistochemical stains indicating positive cells for synaptophysin and a sustentacular pattern of cells positive for S-100 further support this diagnosis. Middle ear paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors, usually do not invade the facial canal. Facial nerve hemangiomas and middle ear adenomas are less common and have different histological findings.
A
931
The correct answer is C: Mucocele.

Explanation: Mucocele is a common cystic lesion that occurs on the lower lip, usually as a result of salivary gland duct rupture or blockage. It is characterized by the accumulation of mucus within the tissue, which may be released through a small opening or duct. Clinical examination shows a nontender, mobile, cystic nodule with the outflow of clear serous fluid upon palpation.

Histopathological examination of the excised specimen reveals an endophytic growing lesion with an acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds. There is an infiltrating border, and the surface of the papillae may show columnar epithelium. Mucocytes, organized in small tubuloacinar structures, empty onto the surface epithelium or are individually dispersed throughout the epithelium. Neutrophil infiltration may also be observed.

Intraductal papilloma and oral inverted ductal papilloma are not typically found on the lower lip and do not present with the characteristic features described in the case. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor and would show atypia, mitotic figures, and infiltration into surrounding tissues, which are absent in this case.
D
932
B: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left-sided facial pain, fullness, trismus, decreased visual acuity, swelling, and worsening pain are suggestive of a mass in the nasopharyngeal region. The CT scan shows a hyperdense mass extending into the left infratemporal fossa with widening of the sphenopalatine foramen, which is consistent with the location of a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The MRI confirms the presence of a vascular mass extending into the nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and inferior orbital fissure. The gross specimen also matches the appearance seen in the MRI.
B
933
The answer is C: Arteriovenous malformation.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the left parotid gland. The patient had recurrent unilateral swelling with a palpable mass in the parotid region during episodes, which suggests a vascular abnormality. The pronounced left facial swelling during a Valsalva maneuver also supports the diagnosis of an AVM.

The STIR image demonstrates a hyperintense lesion involving the left parotid gland and extending to the left side of the neck. The T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced angiography shows a homogenous contrast-enhancing lesion, indicating the presence of abnormal blood vessels within the parotid gland.

Venous malformation and lymphatic malformation can also manifest as swelling in the parotid gland, but they typically present with different imaging characteristics. Venous malformations typically show phleboliths (calcifications) and a cavernous appearance on imaging, while lymphatic malformations typically appear as cystic lesions.

Chronic sialadenitis is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have a history of chronic inflammation or infection in the parotid gland, and the imaging findings are not consistent with the diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the left parotid gland.
A
934
B: Refer to neurology department

Explanation: The presence of bilateral sixth nerve palsy in this child with acquired diplopia, along with the symptoms of headache and fever, suggests that there may be an underlying neurological cause. The blurred optic nerve margins on fundus examination also indicate the need for further evaluation. Referring the patient to the neurology department will allow for a comprehensive neurological assessment and appropriate management of the underlying condition. Continuing oral antibiotics may not be sufficient to address the neurologic involvement, and proceeding with strabismus surgery without identifying and treating the underlying cause would not be the appropriate course of action. Continuing neuroimaging may be considered based on the findings of the neurology assessment.

I would recommend choosing option D: Orbital imaging (B-scan or computed tomography). 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of rapid loss of vision with the onset of a white ring surrounding the optic nerve indicates a potential serious condition affecting the eye. Orbital imaging, such as a B-scan or computed tomography, can help evaluate the structures within the orbit, including the optic nerve and surrounding tissues. This can provide important diagnostic information to help determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing

Explanation: The presented case is suggestive of an inflammatory process involving the meninges and optic nerves, which requires further evaluation. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing is used to identify certain autoimmune disorders, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels and potentially affect the meninges and optic nerves. ANCA testing should be performed to assess for an underlying autoimmune etiology and guide further management. The other options listed (A, C, and D) are not specifically indicated in this case.

B: Administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression for Susac syndrome.

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including bilateral decreased vision, retinal vascular changes (multiple retinal arteriolar occlusions with variable leakage), and neurological symptoms (headache, personality changes, hearing loss, vertigo, gait imbalance, ataxia), is consistent with Susac syndrome. Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the small blood vessels in the brain, retina, and cochlea. Treatment typically involves immunosuppression with systemic steroids and other immunosuppressive agents to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage.

Answer: D: Diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta.

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including high-speed motor vehicle collision, multiple closed long bone fractures, hemodynamic instability, and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm on chest radiography, suggests a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture. Additionally, the computed tomography findings of diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta further support this diagnosis. This is a serious condition that requires immediate surgical intervention.

Answer: C: Sigmoid endometriosis

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation with crampy abdominal pain and repeated lower gastrointestinal bleeding, along with the finding of an eccentric and irregular masslike thickening of the sigmoid colon on computed tomography, is suggestive of sigmoid endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus, and it can involve the gastrointestinal tract, including the sigmoid colon. It can cause symptoms such as pelvic pain, menstrual irregularities, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's history of a hysterectomy for menorrhagia further supports the possibility of endometriosis involvement in the sigmoid colon. The absence of stigmata of recent bleed during colonoscopy and normal colonic mucosa biopsy exclude other possible causes such as sigmoid adenocarcinoma, rectosigmoid polyp, or rectosigmoid leiomyoma.

940
B: Immune-related hypophysitis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of daily headaches, low energy levels, and difficulty reading, in addition to the laboratory findings of low levels of ACTH and cortisol, suggest the possibility of hypophysitis. Immune-related hypophysitis is an inflammatory disorder affecting the pituitary gland and can occur as an adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, which the patient is receiving for her metastatic melanoma. The gradual decrease in TSH levels and the MRI findings further support this diagnosis. Brain metastasis, pituitary adenoma, and mucocele do not account for all of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

941
D: Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement.

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the yellowing skin on her palms and soles is excessive intake of beta carotene from the nutritional supplement. Beta carotene is a precursor to vitamin A and excessive intake can lead to a condition called carotenosis, which causes yellow-orange pigmentation of the skin. There is no indication for a biopsy or repeat liver function tests as the patient's previous tests were normal and there is no evidence of liver disease. Empirical treatment with a topical steroid would not be necessary as the condition is not inflammatory or allergic in nature. Advising the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement is the most appropriate course of action.

C: Obtain renal biopsy

Explanation: Given the patient's history of anuria, significant increase in BUN and creatinine levels, and the presence of proteinuria and monoclonal IgG κ band, it is important to obtain a renal biopsy to determine the underlying cause of the acute kidney injury. A renal biopsy can help identify the presence of monoclonal gammopathy-associated renal diseases, such as light chain cast nephropathy (myeloma kidney) or amyloidosis, which can present with acute renal failure. This information will guide the appropriate management and treatment for the patient.

C: Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline.

Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with severe malaria, including fever, weakness, fatigue, confusion, jaundice, and thrombocytopenia. The travel history to Sierra Leone further supports the diagnosis of malaria. Given the severity of the symptoms and the low platelet count, intravenous treatment with quinidine gluconate and doxycycline is the appropriate next step. Artemether-lumefantrine is not the preferred treatment for severe malaria. Chloroquine is ineffective against the malaria strain endemic in Sierra Leone. Exchange transfusion is not indicated in this case.

The correct answer is B: Knee-located erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component.

Explanation: Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare chronic cutaneous vasculitis characterized by symmetrical, erythematous plaques or nodules that predominantly affect the extensor surfaces of the limbs, including the knees. The plaques are typically violaceous in color and may be slightly elevated. In this case, the patient presented with erythematous nodules on the calcanea as well as violaceous plaques on the knees. The biopsy specimens obtained confirm the diagnosis of EED. Treatment options for EED include dapsone, colchicine, and immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids.

Answer: D: Impetigo herpetiformis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a painful eruption with keratotic papulovesicles on the face and neck, along with the presence of honey-colored crusts, is consistent with impetigo herpetiformis. Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare dermatosis that is typically associated with pregnancy and is characterized by the rapid onset of erythematous, pustular lesions. The histopathological findings of full-thickness epidermal necrosis with suprabasal acantholysis, corp ronds, corp grains, and parakeratosis further support the diagnosis of impetigo herpetiformis. Kaposi varicelliform eruption, impetigo, and pemphigoid gestationis can be ruled out based on the clinical and histopathological findings.

The correct diagnosis for this case is D: Leprosy. 

Explanation: Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. The patient's presentation of hair loss, swollen and painful hand joints, and asymptomatic nodules on the skin are consistent with the clinical manifestations of leprosy.

Leprosy can lead to peripheral nerve damage, which can cause sensory loss and neuropathic changes. In this case, the patient did not exhibit these neurologic symptoms.

Laboratory test results, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor, may suggest an immune response seen in leprosy. Other immunology indicators were normal, ruling out other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.

The presence of acid-fast bacilli on the skin biopsy supports the diagnosis of leprosy.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Leprosy.

Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to choose option A: Trauma-focused psychotherapy.

Explanation: Trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE), is considered the first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This approach aims to address the traumatic experiences and associated symptoms in a structured and evidence-based manner. The patient in this case has a clear history of traumatic experiences in the military and is exhibiting symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD, including intrusive thoughts, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal symptoms, and impaired functioning.

While pharmacotherapy can be considered as an adjunct to psychotherapy, it is generally not recommended as the initial treatment for PTSD. Furthermore, the patient has already tried and discontinued an SSRI medication previously without finding it helpful.

Both risperidone (option B) and propranolol (option D) have limited evidence supporting their use in the treatment of PTSD, particularly compared to trauma-focused psychotherapy.

Prazosin (option C) is commonly used to manage nightmares and sleep disturbances associated with PTSD, but it is not a standalone treatment for the disorder. It may be considered as an adjunctive medication along with trauma-focused psychotherapy if the patient continues to experience significant sleep disruptions.

Therefore, based on the current guidelines and the specific details provided in the case, trauma-focused psychotherapy (option A) is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

The correct diagnosis is C: Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).

Explanation: 

This patient's presentation is consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison disease. The patient has signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, including postural lightheadedness, fatigue, muscle weakness, salt cravings, weight loss, loss of axillary hair, and missed periods. The hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue is a characteristic feature of primary adrenal insufficiency, caused by increased production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and subsequent activation of melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptors. The presence of optic disc swelling suggests increased intracranial pressure, which can occur in Addison disease due to elevated ACTH levels.

Hypervitaminosis A is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have typical symptoms associated with excessive vitamin A intake, such as skin changes, bone pain, or dryness of the eyes and mucous membranes.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is characterized by symptoms of lightheadedness and increased heart rate upon standing, but it does not explain the other symptoms in this case, such as weight loss, hyperpigmentation, and optic disc swelling.

Anorexia nervosa can cause weight loss and missed periods, but it does not explain the other symptoms seen in this patient, such as postural lightheadedness, muscle weakness, salt cravings, hyperpigmentation, and optic disc swelling.

D: Surgical intervention for residual ventricular septal defect.

Explanation: The patient's history of corrected tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) suggests the possibility of residual defects. The presence of a parasternal lift and auscultatory findings at the left upper sternal border are indicative of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) that has not been adequately closed. The finding of right ventricular diastolic volume index of 161 mL/m2 on cardiac magnetic resonance further supports the suspicion of a significant VSD. Surgical intervention, such as closure of the residual VSD, would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Options A (Sildenafil for severe pulmonary hypertension), B (Balloon valvotomy for severe pulmonary valvular stenosis), and C (Pulmonary valve replacement for severe pulmonary regurgitation) are not indicated in this case as the primary issue is the residual VSD.

Based on the given information and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is B: Malignant carotid body tumor.

Explanation:
The patient presented with a slowly growing right-sided neck mass associated with tenderness and progressive dysphagia. Imaging studies revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right side of the neck, surrounding both the internal and external carotid arteries. These findings are consistent with a carotid body tumor.

Carotid body tumors are rare neoplasms that arise from the paraganglia located at the carotid bifurcation. They are typically slow-growing and can compress adjacent structures, causing symptoms such as neck tenderness and dysphagia.

The laceration of the internal carotid artery during surgery further supports the diagnosis of a carotid body tumor. Hemangiopericytoma (D) could be a consideration, but it is less likely given the typical location of the mass and the involvement of the carotid arteries.

Atypical carcinoid (A) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (C) are unrelated to the carotid space and would not be expected to cause the described imaging findings.

Overall, the most likely diagnosis is a malignant carotid body tumor based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and intraoperative findings.

The correct diagnosis is C: Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma.

Explanation:
Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma (NCMH) is a rare benign tumor that typically presents in infancy or early childhood. It is characterized by the proliferation of mesenchymal cells and cartilage within the nasal cavity. NCMH can cause nasal obstruction, respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties, as seen in this case.

In this patient, the initial evaluation showed a right septal deviation, leading to the initial treatment with topical medications. However, the symptoms persisted, and on subsequent examinations, a large inferior turbinate was also identified on the left side. Finally, on the 12th day of life, a mucosalized mass filling the left nasal cavity was visualized.

The maxillofacial CT scan showed a mass in the left mid-nasal cavity, compressing the middle turbinate and lamina papyracea. The cribriform plate was slightly widened, prompting further investigation with MRI. The MRI confirmed the presence of a 2-cm heterogeneous mass without intracranial extension.

Transnasal endoscopic excision of the mass was performed, revealing a smooth, epithelialized, pedunculated mass located at the anterior aspect of the face of the left sphenoid sinus and medial to the middle turbinate. Histologic examination subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of a nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, characterized by regions of cartilage admixed with irregular areas of chondromyxoid stroma containing spindle cells.

Answer: D: Chordoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of progressive sore throat, globus sensation, and dysphagia along with the imaging findings of a retropharyngeal mass with involvement of the C2 vertebral body and odontoid process are most consistent with a chordoma. Chordomas are slow-growing malignant neoplasms derived from remnants of the embryonic notochord. They commonly occur in the sacrum, clivus, and vertebral bodies, and rarely in the retropharyngeal space. The characteristic histopathologic findings of chordomas include sheets and cords of tumor cells with eosinophilic granular, clear, or bubbly cytoplasm on a basophilic myxoid stromal background, and scattered physaliphorous cells. Immunohistochemical analysis typically shows positive staining for brachyury, a transcription factor that is highly specific for chordomas. Treatment typically involves surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy or proton therapy.
D
953
The answer is C: Desmoid tumor.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with a unilateral neck swelling that had persisted for several months. The MRI showed a mass arising from the medial aspect of the right mandible with cortical destruction. The mass was isointense to muscle on T1 sequence, heterogeneously hyperintense with internal foci of decreased intensity on T2 sequence, and demonstrated homogeneous contrast enhancement.

The histopathological findings showed spindle cell proliferation with abundant intervening collagen, which is characteristic of a desmoid tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for β-catenin and negative for CD34, desmin, and smooth muscle actin.

Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive fibroblastic neoplasms that arise from musculoaponeurotic structures. They are rare in pediatric patients and can present as firm, immobile, and nontender masses. Treatment options include watchful waiting, surgical resection, radiation therapy, or medical management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal agents, or chemotherapy. In this case, chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was initiated and continued for 2 years, leading to a decrease in the size of the tumor on follow-up MRI.
C
954
I would choose option B: Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats.

Explanation: The strong family history of bilateral ptosis suggests a potential genetic inheritance pattern. Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats is associated with certain types of hereditary ptosis, such as myotonic dystrophy or Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Testing for GCG triplet repeats can confirm the genetic cause of the ptosis and help guide further management and treatment options.

Based on the given information, the next step would be to check the blood pressure (Answer D). The patient's symptoms of headaches and blurry vision, along with the findings of optic nerve hyperemia, bilateral serous retinal detachments, and vitreous cells, could be indicative of hypertensive retinopathy. Thus, checking the blood pressure would be important to assess for hypertension as a potential cause of the symptoms.
A: Obtain an infectious and inflammatory panel 

Explanation: The presence of bilateral retinal hemorrhages in a young man with no history of eye problems, along with symptoms such as easy bruising and progressive fatigue, suggests a systemic cause for the retinal vein occlusions. Obtaining an infectious and inflammatory panel would help evaluate for potential underlying systemic conditions such as infections or autoimmune disorders, which could be contributing to the retinal hemorrhages.

I would choose answer option C: Observe and manage glaucoma.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure, it is important to manage the glaucoma to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Additionally, the presence of vitreous deposits and retinal detachment may be related to the steroid injections and require monitoring. Vitrectomy (answer option A) may be considered if the vitreous opacities persist or worsen, but it is not the first-line approach in this case. Biopsy (answer option B) and enucleation (answer option D) are not indicated based on the information provided.

The correct answer is B: Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.
Explanation: Clinical features such as right upper abdominal pain, high-grade fever, and tenderness in the right upper quadrant, along with imaging findings of a large hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver along with gallstones, suggest acute cholecystitis. The presence of a hypoechoic area involving segments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the liver, along with the gallstone and the gallbladder fundus just below it, indicates intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder. This can lead to the spread of infection and inflammation into the liver tissue. The other options, liver abscess, gallbladder cancer with contiguous liver infiltration, and necrotic liver tumor, do not explain all the clinical and imaging findings in this case.
B

959
The correct answer is B: Cecal diverticulum.

Explanation: Based on the description and CT scan findings, the presence of a cystic lesion in close relation to the cecum suggests a cecal diverticulum. A cecal diverticulum is a rare condition characterized by an outpouching or sac-like structure originating from the cecum. It is typically asymptomatic and incidentally discovered during imaging studies. It can mimic other cystic lesions in the right iliac fossa, such as mucocele of the appendix or ileal duplication cyst. However, the absence of other positive radiologic findings and normal laboratory results make these less likely. Meckel diverticulum is a congenital abnormality located in the small intestine, while the described lesion is in the right iliac fossa. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is cecal diverticulum.

The correct answer is C: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

Explanation:
The presentation of a large cystic mass originating from the body of the pancreas and protruding into the gastric wall, along with additional findings such as a hypodense lesion in the liver, ascites, and splenomegaly, is consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) involving the pancreas. GISTs are neoplasms that arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract and can occur in various organs, including the pancreas.

The CT scan shows a large heterogeneous cystic mass with well-defined margins, which is typical of a GIST. The presence of septations and a solid component within the tumor further support the diagnosis of a GIST. Fine-needle aspiration of the solid component is commonly performed to obtain tissue for histological analysis.

In terms of the differential diagnosis, solid pseudopapillary neoplasia of the pancreas (A) typically presents as a solid and cystic mass in young women, but it usually does not involve the gastric wall. Atypical mucinous cystic neoplasia of the pancreas (B) typically presents as a cystic lesion with thick septations and mucin production. Pancreatic pseudocyst (D) is a fluid-filled cavity that develops as a complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, and it does not typically involve the gastric wall.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histological analysis would be C: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

B: Admit to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy
Explanation: Given the history of an exquisitely tender rash at the base of the thumb, the presence of vesicles with purulent fluid, and the potential exposure to the rash at work, these findings are consistent with herpetic whitlow, a viral infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). Antiviral therapy is the mainstay of treatment for herpetic whitlow. Intravenous antiviral therapy is recommended for severe or extensive cases, as the patient in this case has involvement on the hand. Admitting the patient to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.
C

962
B: Start heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including increasing dyspnea on exertion, prominent P2 on cardiac examination, and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, suggests the possibility of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Additionally, the presence of a nonocclusive thrombus in the left femoral and popliteal veins indicates a thrombotic component. The appropriate management for CTEPH is anticoagulation with heparin followed by an oral anticoagulant such as warfarin for at least 6 months. This treatment approach aims to prevent further thrombus formation and allows time for potential resolution. Surgical embolectomy or pulmonary thromboendarterectomy may be considered in selected cases, but referral for evaluation is not indicated at this initial stage of management. Parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators may be used to treat exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but they are not the primary treatment for this patient's condition.
D

963
D: Graft-vs-host disease.

Explanation: The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplant, and biopsy-proven cutaneous and gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease are indicative of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a common complication of stem cell transplant that occurs when the donor immune cells recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign and mount an immune response against them. Involvement of the sun-exposed areas and bony prominences is characteristic of chronic GVHD. The patient's immunosuppressive medications, such as tacrolimus hydrate and prednisone, further support the diagnosis. The skin lesions, including the flaccid bullae and erosions, are consistent with GVHD.

A: Disseminated granuloma annulare

Explanation: The patient's presentation with red-brown monomorphic papules coalescing into plaques on the face, trunk, and extremities is typical of disseminated granuloma annulare. The histopathologic analysis using hematoxylin-eosin staining is consistent with the diagnosis of granuloma annulare, which shows a necrobiotic center surrounded by palisading histiocytes in the dermis. Other findings, such as periodic acid-Schiff and acid-fast bacilli stains, are not mentioned in the case and are not typically associated with granuloma annulare.
B
cellvalue empty
965
Answer: B: Cutaneous tuberculosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a painful papulonodule on the foot, along with a history of HIV infection and latent tuberculosis, suggests cutaneous tuberculosis as the most likely diagnosis. The slow growth, tenderness, periodic drainage of clear-to-yellow material, and absence of systemic symptoms are consistent with cutaneous tuberculosis. The biopsy findings of acute and chronic inflammation within the deep dermis, eosinophilic material surrounding small cocci, and positive Gram stain support the diagnosis. Botryomycosis would present with multiple granules and chronic inflammation, which is not seen in this case. Digital mucous cysts are typically found on the fingers and can have a translucent cystic appearance. Foreign-body reaction would typically present as a chronic inflammatory reaction to a foreign body and is less likely given the clinical presentation in this case.

966
The correct answer is C: Seronegative myasthenia gravis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical features, including muscular weakness, waddling gait, hyperlordosis, difficulties rising from the floor, peripheral facial weakness, and bilateral eyelid ptosis, are consistent with myasthenia gravis. The negative results for acetylcholinesterase antibodies do not exclude the diagnosis, as up to 10-20% of patients with myasthenia gravis may be seronegative. The improvement in muscular weakness during an asthma attack suggests a possible relationship between the two conditions. The patient's ability to walk several kilometers during the asthma attack further supports the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, as exercise can temporarily improve muscle strength in some myasthenia gravis patients. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest Pompe disease, spinal muscular atrophy, or Becker muscular dystrophy based on the clinical presentation.

967
The possible answer is C: Hypothyroidism.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as heavy periods, short stature, acanthosis nigricans (a skin condition associated with insulin resistance), dry skin, and nonpitting edema, are suggestive of hypothyroidism. Additionally, the family history of hypothyroidism further supports this diagnosis. It is important to consider underlying conditions, such as hypothyroidism, in patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis, as it may contribute to the development of this condition.

968
B: Magnetic resonance imaging to rule out myocarditis vs ischemia

Explanation:
Given the patient's clinical presentation and echocardiographic findings consistent with apical akinesis, along with the absence of significant coronary artery disease risk factors, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome) is a possible diagnosis. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes of the symptoms, such as myocarditis or ischemia.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be the most appropriate next step to differentiate between these possibilities. MRI can provide detailed information about myocardial inflammation and perfusion, as well as evaluate for the presence of ischemia. It can help confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy by demonstrating characteristic findings such as myocardial edema and absence of significant coronary artery disease.

Therefore, option B: Magnetic resonance imaging to rule out myocarditis vs ischemia is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.
C

969
The correct answer is C: Lymphangiomatous polyp.

Explanation: The case description presents a young man with an enlarging unilateral tonsil mass. The histologic sections reveal a polypoid structure composed of a fibrovascular core covered by stratified squamous epithelium. A subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue is noted, as well as lymphatic channels accentuated by D2-40 antibody. This description is consistent with a lymphangiomatous polyp.

Fibroepithelial polyp (A) is a benign lesion that typically occurs in the skin and is not commonly seen in the tonsils. Lymphangioma (B) is a benign tumor of lymphatic vessels, but the histologic description in the case does not fit with this diagnosis. Juvenile angiofibroma (D) is a vascular tumor that typically occurs in adolescent males and presents with nasal obstruction and epistaxis, not with tonsillar involvement.
C
970
My diagnosis is D: Solitary cutaneous myxoma.

Explanation: Based on the provided information and the histopathological examination, the characteristics of the mass, including its location on the posterior surface of the auricle, the glistening appearance, and the presence of a gelatinous myxoid matrix, are consistent with a solitary cutaneous myxoma. This is a benign soft tissue tumor composed of hypocellular stroma with scattered bland spindle cells and a myxoid matrix. The absence of mitotic activity and the lack of abnormal pigmentation or cardiac problems also support this diagnosis. Surgical excision is the preferred treatment option for cutaneous myxomas, and the lack of recurrence during the follow-up period is in line with this diagnosis. Epidermoid cysts and dermoid cysts typically have a different histological appearance, and chondromas involve cartilaginous tissue rather than myxoid matrix.
D
971
The correct answer is D: Osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Explanation: The combination of hypercalcemia, significantly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and the presence of lytic bone lesions is highly suggestive of osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is a manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism. Osteitis fibrosa cystica is caused by excessive secretion of PTH by a parathyroid gland adenoma, which leads to bone resorption and the development of cystic lesions. In this case, the technetium Tc 99m sestamibi SPECT/CT scan identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, confirming the diagnosis.
D
972
Based on the provided information and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is C: Multifocal granular cell tumor.

Explanation: 
Multifocal granular cell tumor is a rare neoplasm that predominantly affects the larynx. It presents with hoarseness, dysphonia, and breathing difficulties. In this case, the patient exhibited dysphonia, breathiness in the voice, and laryngeal lesions on flexible laryngoscopy. The biopsy results showed mucosal infiltration by cells with round nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm, which is characteristic of granular cell tumors.

Sarcoidosis is an autoimmune disease that can involve multiple organs, but laryngeal involvement is rare and would not typically present with the described lesions.

Respiratory papillomatosis is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and presents with recurrent papillomas in the larynx. There is no mention of papillomas or HPV in the case description.

Metastatic neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that primarily affects children and originates in the adrenal glands. It would typically present with symptoms related to the primary tumor site and metastasis, rather than the laryngeal findings described in this case.
C
973
The answer is B: Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.

Explanation: The computed tomographic image of the chest reveals a large cystic lesion in the left lung, consistent with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM). CCAM is a lung developmental anomaly characterized by the overgrowth of abnormal lung tissue. It commonly presents in infancy and can lead to respiratory distress, recurrent infections, and lung collapse. In this case, the left lung collapse and the presence of a cystic lesion on CT imaging support the diagnosis of CCAM.
C
974
B: Initiate steroid-sparing immunomodulator 

Explanation: Given the recurrence of symptoms despite treatment with steroids, and the new-onset cranial neuropathies, it suggests that the patient's condition may be refractory to steroids alone. Initiating a steroid-sparing immunomodulator would be the next appropriate step in managing this patient's recalcitrant orbital pain. This approach aims to address the underlying inflammatory process that is driving the symptoms, while minimizing the need for long-term steroid use and its potential side effects.

B: Take the patient to the operating room for a saline washout with an air bubble.

Explanation: In the case of a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface, a washout procedure is typically performed to clear the blood and reposition the detached membrane. The most conservative approach is to perform a saline washout with an air bubble, which helps reattach the Descemet membrane. This procedure can be done in the operating room and may help improve the patient's visual acuity.

C: Instill atropine and IOP-lowering drops and place the patient in a supine position.

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms, including blurry vision, pain, and photophobia, along with the physical examination findings of conjunctival injection, corneal stromal edema, and a lens protruding through the pupil, suggest acute angle-closure glaucoma. The high intraocular pressure (43 mm Hg) in the affected eye further supports this diagnosis. The appropriate initial management for acute angle-closure glaucoma includes reducing intraocular pressure and dilating the pupil to relieve pupillary block. Therefore, instilling atropine and IOP-lowering drops, such as topical beta-blockers, would help to decrease intraocular pressure. Placing the patient in a supine position may also help alleviate the symptoms and prevent further pupillary blockage.

I would choose option D: Fluorescein angiography.

Explanation: Diffuse retinal hemorrhages and disc edema can be signs of retinal ischemia, and fluorescein angiography would provide valuable information about retinal perfusion. This test can help determine if there is any vascular occlusion or leakage contributing to the patient's symptoms. Complete blood cell count and coagulation testing can be considered later if there is suspicion of a hematologic disorder, but fluorescein angiography should be prioritized to assess retinal perfusion. Oral and topical corticosteroids and plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome are not appropriate in this case as there is no evidence to suggest that these treatments would be effective or indicated.

978
B: Lymphoma of the small bowel

Explanation: Given the patient's history of hypochromic microcytic anemia and the presence of an intraluminal hypodense mass causing small-bowel obstruction, lymphoma of the small bowel is a likely diagnosis. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can occur in various parts of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms of cramps, abdominal pain, and anemia are consistent with small-bowel lymphoma. Further diagnostic tests, such as biopsy, will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

The correct answer is C: Cecal diverticulitis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the location and onset of the pain, is consistent with diverticulitis. Cecal diverticulitis refers to the inflammation of diverticula (small pockets) in the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. The thickening of the cecal wall and the hypoechoic area seen on ultrasonography support the diagnosis. The normal findings on rectal examination and negative findings on abdominal radiograph suggest a localized inflammatory process rather than a generalized condition. The patient's elevated white blood cell count, aspartate aminotransferase level, and alanine aminotransferase level are nonspecific and can be associated with the inflammatory process. The presence of hepatic steatosis may be unrelated to the patient's current symptoms.

The diagnosis would be C: Glioblastoma multiforme. 

Explanation: Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive type of brain tumor that commonly presents with rapid enlargement and infiltrative growth. It often involves multiple structures of the brain and can extend extracranially. The MRI findings, including the large enhancing mass, dural thickening, and adjacent edema, are consistent with glioblastoma multiforme. Meningioma typically presents as a well-circumscribed mass and does not typically involve the brain parenchyma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and meningeal sarcoma are less common in the central nervous system and have different imaging features compared to glioblastoma multiforme.

Based on the clinical presentation and the presence of grouped vesicles on the sole of the right foot, the most likely diagnosis is herpes zoster, also known as shingles. This is a viral infection caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which initially causes chickenpox.

Explanation:
B: Initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir.

Herpes zoster is typically a self-limiting condition, but antiviral therapy is recommended to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, especially in immunocompromised individuals or those with severe pain. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication commonly used for the treatment of herpes zoster. It is important to start antiviral therapy within 72 hours of rash onset for maximum benefit.

A: Obtain blood cultures is not necessary in this case because there is no evidence of systemic infection or sepsis.

C: Prescribe an oral antihistamine agent is not indicated in this case as antihistamines are used for allergic reactions, and there is no evidence to suggest this is an allergic response.

D: Prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream is contraindicated in herpes zoster as it can impede the natural healing process and may increase the risk of secondary infection.

Therefore, the correct answer option is B: Initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir.

Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunoassay. Therefore, the answer would be D.

Explanation: The patient presents with fever and a pustular rash, along with elevated inflammatory markers. The absence of organisms in the pustule fluid and negative cultures suggest that this may not be an infection. Additionally, the punch biopsy findings suggest a possible drug-induced eruption. Given the recent use of ibuprofen and the timing of symptoms, an adverse drug reaction is a possibility. However, it is important to consider other causes, such as HIV, which can present with similar symptoms. Therefore, obtaining an HIV immunoassay would be appropriate to rule out HIV infection. Avoiding further ibuprofen use may also be recommended, but it should not be the only step taken at this point. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate management.
Based on the information provided, the next step would be to perform a lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [Option C]. This is necessary to gather more information about the underlying cause of the brain mass and associated symptoms.

Explanation: A lumbar puncture can help diagnose the etiology of the brain mass by analyzing the CSF. It can provide important information about the presence of infection (such as Toxoplasma gondii) or other abnormalities. Given the patient's HIV-positive status and low CD4 cell count, it is important to rule out opportunistic infections, such as CNS toxoplasmosis, which could be causing the brain mass. Starting treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis [Option D] without confirming the diagnosis can lead to potential harm to the patient. Initiating ART [Option A] is an important step in managing HIV infection, but in this case, it is necessary to gather more information about the brain mass before proceeding with treatment. Obtaining a brain biopsy [Option B] is an invasive procedure and can be deferred until the results of the CSF analysis are available.
B: Methimazole-induced vasculitis

Explanation: The patient's history of Graves disease and use of methimazole, along with the appearance of painful ulcers on the lower extremities, suggests the possibility of methimazole-induced vasculitis. Methimazole is an antithyroid medication that has been associated with the development of various skin reactions, including vasculitis. The appearance of discrete ulcers with central eschars, dusky gray borders, and collarettes of scale is consistent with vasculitis. The biopsy findings showing a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and focal abscess further support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms worsening despite treatment with antibiotics for a possible secondary infection also suggest an underlying vasculitic process.

The correct answer is D: Lipoid proteinosis.

Explanation: Lipoid proteinosis, also known as Urbach-Wiethe disease, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deposition of hyaline material in various organs, including the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. It is caused by mutations in the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene.

Clinically, lipoid proteinosis typically presents with a hoarse voice, thickening and scarring of the skin and mucosa, and characteristic papules and plaques on the face, especially involving the eyelids and perioral area. The lesions are usually firm, waxy, and may have a variably verrucous appearance. They tend to coalesce and form plaques.

Skin biopsy findings in lipoid proteinosis show nodular deposits of basement membrane material in the dermis, which stain positively with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and are diastase-resistant. These findings correspond to the nodular deposits seen in Figure C, which is consistent with lipoid proteinosis.

Unlike in lipoid proteinosis, erythropoietic protoporphyria (choice B) typically presents with painful photosensitivity and is characterized by the accumulation of protoporphyrin in the skin, causing erythema, edema, and vesicles upon sun exposure.

Colloid milium (choice C) is a distinct entity characterized by the accumulation of elastin, not hyaline material, within the dermis. It typically appears as yellow-white papules and nodules on sun-exposed areas.

Nodular amyloidosis (choice A) refers to the deposition of amyloid protein within the skin, presenting as waxy, firm, yellow-to-pink nodules. Unlike in lipoid proteinosis, the amyloid deposits in nodular amyloidosis are not diastase-resistant.

The correct answer is C: Erythema multiforme.

Explanation: Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by the development of target-like lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. It is often triggered by infections, medications, or other environmental factors. In this case, the patient's symptoms began with upper respiratory tract symptoms, followed by the development of blisters on the hands and feet. The physical examination findings of pink to violaceous macules, papules, patches, and dusky bullae on the extremities, as well as scattered lesions on the face, neck, trunk, and scrotum, are consistent with erythema multiforme. The presence of white lines in the oral cavity is known as Wickham striae, which can be seen in erythema multiforme. The laboratory findings of an elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count may suggest an underlying inflammatory process. The negative Tzanck smear and the punch biopsy findings support the diagnosis of erythema multiforme.

B: Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome

Explanation: The patient presented with progressive difficulty walking (ataxia), difficulty deciphering speech (hearing impairment), and later developed cognitive decline and personality changes. These symptoms are consistent with the syndrome known as Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CANVAS syndrome). Other potential causes have been ruled out, such as paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia, Wernicke encephalopathy, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The MRI findings and absence of other abnormalities in CSF testing and imaging support the diagnosis of CANVAS syndrome.

The correct answer is A: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including progressive depression, bradyphrenia, dyscalculia, and fatigue, along with the neuroimaging findings of scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter affecting the corpus callosum, bifrontal, and biparietal regions, are consistent with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is a hereditary cerebrovascular disease characterized by mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, leading to degeneration of smooth muscle cells in small arteries and arterioles in the brain and other organs. This can result in subcortical infarcts, white matter abnormalities, and cognitive impairment. The family history of a chronic neuropsychiatric illness also supports the diagnosis, as CADASIL is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

B: Pediculosis corporis

Explanation: The presence of blue-gray macules along with pink papules on the trunk and the description of ill-defined 1-cm blue-gray macules suggests a diagnosis of pediculosis corporis, also known as body lice infestation. Pediculosis corporis is characterized by the presence of blue-gray macules (maculae caeruleae) which are caused by lice feces and are commonly seen in areas of the body that are prone to infestation, such as the trunk. The pink papules with hemorrhagic punctae may represent secondary skin changes from scratching. The history of the cousin with persistent skin lesions and pruritus raises suspicion for a possible lice infestation in the household.

D: Implant a loop recorder.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with exercise-induced syncope and evidence of AV block on ECG suggests a potential bradyarrhythmia as the cause. The abrupt decrease in heart rate during peak exercise further supports this suspicion. To further evaluate and monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm, the next step would be to implant a loop recorder. A loop recorder is a small device placed under the skin that continuously records the heart's electrical activity. It allows for longer-term monitoring and can capture any abnormal rhythms or episodes of bradycardia that may occur during exercise or other activities. This would provide valuable information to guide further management and treatment in this patient.

The diagnosis is A: Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Explanation: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are specialized immune cells. It can affect multiple organ systems, including the bones, skin, and lungs. In this case, the patient has manifestations consistent with LCH involving multiple systems.

The nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and difficulty hearing are due to involvement of the sinuses, mastoid bones, and middle ears. The bony changes seen on radiographs, CT scan, and the varus deformity of the lower extremities are also consistent with LCH.

The macules with irregular borders on the skin are called "café-au-lait" spots and are commonly seen in LCH. Additionally, the asymmetry of the head and prominence of the right temporal and parietal area are likely due to involvement of the skull bones.

Laboratory findings, such as the low thyroid-stimulating hormone level (TSH) and normal thyroid hormone levels, can be seen in cases of LCH.

McCune-Albright syndrome (Choice B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by café-au-lait spots, endocrine abnormalities, and fibrous dysplasia of the bones. However, the presence of multiple macules, bony changes, and involvement of the sinuses and middle ears are not typical of McCune-Albright syndrome.

Juvenile Paget disease (Choice C) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone turnover leading to deformities and fractures. However, the involvement of multiple systems, café-au-lait spots, and the nasal symptoms are not consistent with Juvenile Paget disease.

Ossifying fibromas (Choice D) are benign bone tumors that can cause pain and deformity, but they do not typically involve multiple systems or present with skin findings like café-au-lait spots.
B
992
The diagnosis is D: Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma.

Explanation: The histopathologic images of the excised nasal mass show a disordered admixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures. This is consistent with the features of a rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma. Glioma and rhabdomyosarcoma are unlikely in this case, as they typically present with more aggressive clinical features. A neuromuscular hamartoma would generally involve peripheral nerves and is not commonly seen in the nasal dorsum.
D
993
A: Amyloidosis

Explanation: The presence of an exophytic yellow-white mid-membranous subepithelial lesion on the true vocal folds, along with the histopathologic findings of submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material and needle-shaped birefringent crystals, is consistent with the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition in the vocal folds can cause hoarseness and changes in vocal fold contour and vibration. In this case, the diagnosis is further supported by the negative Congo red stain, which is characteristic of amyloid deposits. Laryngeal gout, rheumatoid nodules, and squamous cell carcinoma would present with different clinical and histopathologic features.

B: Dermoid cyst

Explanation: The patient presented with a painless, progressively increasing swelling in the sublingual area. Physical examination revealed nontender swelling of the floor of the mouth, with elevation of the tongue. CT imaging showed a cystic nonenhancing mass centered in the root of the tongue, with compression of the sublingual glands and effacement of the sublingual spaces. Surgical excision yielded a smooth, well-circumscribed mass. Histologic examination showed keratinizing squamous epithelium.
All these findings are consistent with a dermoid cyst, which is a benign developmental cyst that arises from embryonic tissue trapped during midline fusion. Dermoid cysts commonly occur in the head and neck region, including the oral cavity. They typically present as painless, slow-growing masses and contain various skin appendages, including hair follicles and sebaceous glands.

D: Staging workup (eg, total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging)

Explanation: Given the presence of a dark retinal lesion with well-defined margins and significant protrusion into the vitreous cavity, further staging workup is necessary to determine the nature and extent of the lesion. This can be achieved through total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging, which can help identify any potential systemic involvement or metastasis. Genetic testing may be considered in certain cases where there is suspicion for a hereditary condition, but it is not the initial course of action in this scenario. Observation with normal follow-up can be considered if the lesion is determined to be benign and not causing any visual or systemic symptoms. Surgical excision and histopathologic analysis may be necessary if the lesion is suspicious for malignancy or cannot be definitively diagnosed through non-invasive imaging. However, further staging workup is needed before proceeding with any surgical intervention.

D: Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: Given the optic nerve changes seen in the patient's examination, including nerve hyperemia and elevation of nasal disc borders, it is important to rule out any underlying pathologies that could be causing these changes. Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would help visualize the optic nerve and surrounding structures, providing more information about the cause of the optic nerve changes. This would help in making a more accurate diagnosis and determining the appropriate management plan for the patient.

Answer: C: Biopsy the eyelid

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent corneal erosions, ptosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and meibomian gland dysfunction, along with the presence of scarring in the medial canthal area, suggests the possibility of a masquerade syndrome. Masquerade syndrome refers to the presence of an atypical or uncommon condition mimicking a common ocular disease. In this case, the recurrent symptoms and lack of improvement with standard treatments indicate a need for further investigation.

Given the clinical presentation and history, a biopsy of the eyelid should be performed to evaluate for the presence of an underlying malignancy or other atypical pathology. This will help determine the appropriate treatment approach for the patient.

B: Order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

Explanation: Given the clinical features of optic nerve edema with preserved visual function and associated skin rash, it is important to evaluate for possible causes such as infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Bloodwork including complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody testing can help identify systemic causes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits can provide further information on the structural integrity of the optic nerves and rule out any mass lesions or compressive causes. Lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and cerebrospinal fluid analysis can be considered if the initial evaluation is inconclusive or if suspicion for conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension is high. Molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy may be considered if there is a high index of suspicion based on family history or specific clinical features. Computed tomography of the orbits is not the first-line investigation for this presentation and is less sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging for evaluating optic nerve pathology.

B: Order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits

Explanation: The patient's presentation with unilateral optic nerve edema and preserved visual function, along with the associated skin rash and normal neurological examination, raises suspicion for an underlying systemic cause. Ordering bloodwork can help assess for potential systemic or inflammatory causes of optic nerve edema, such as infectious, autoimmune, or granulomatous diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits can provide additional information on the optic nerve and surrounding structures. Lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be considered if the initial workup is unrevealing, but it is not the next best step in this case. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy typically presents with bilateral visual loss and central vision impairment, which is not consistent with the patient's clinical findings. Therefore, molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is not the next best step. Computed tomography (CT) of the orbits may provide some information, but MRI is preferred for better visualization of the optic nerve and surrounding structures.

B: Order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

Explanation: The presentation of unilateral optic nerve edema with preserved visual function and associated symptoms such as a skin rash raises concern for an underlying systemic or inflammatory condition. Ordering bloodwork, including a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory), angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody, can help identify possible causes such as systemic diseases, infections, or autoimmune conditions. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits can provide further evaluation of the optic nerve and rule out any structural abnormalities or inflammation. Lumbar puncture may be considered if there is high suspicion for elevated intracranial pressure. Molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is not necessary at this time as the presentation does not strongly suggest a mitochondrial disorder. Computed tomography of the orbits is not the preferred imaging modality for evaluating the optic nerve and should be reserved for specific indications such as suspected orbital fracture or foreign body.

B: Foreign body ingestion

Explanation:
The abdominal computed tomography scan shows calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis. This finding is suggestive of a foreign body that has been ingested and has become lodged in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to inflammation and potential complications such as perforation. Stump appendicitis, Crohn's ileitis, and carcinoid would present with different imaging findings and clinical features.

The diagnosis for this case is C: Inclusion cyst.

Explanation: The mobile, smooth-surfaced, polypoid subepithelial lesion at the posterolateral wall of the gastroesophageal junction in addition to the findings on endoscopic ultrasonography (anechoic, loculated, subepithelial lesion within the submucosa of the distal esophagus) are consistent with an inclusion cyst. Mucosal biopsies showing normal squamous mucosal epithelium further support this diagnosis. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (A) and esophageal carcinoma (B) typically present with different clinical and imaging characteristics. Bronchogenic cysts (D) are rare congenital lesions that can occur in the mediastinum or within the wall of the esophagus, but they do not typically present with the same symptoms and imaging findings as described in this case.

My diagnosis is C: Adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Explanation: Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a slow-growing malignant tumor that commonly arises in the salivary glands, including the submandibular and parotid glands. It is characterized by infiltrative growth and perineural invasion. In this case, the patient's symptoms of facial and mandibular swelling, pain with chewing, and weight loss, along with the findings of a firm and fixed mass in the left preauricular space expanding into the temporomandibular joint area and zygoma, are suggestive of adenoid cystic carcinoma. The imaging findings of a lobulated enhancing paramandibular mass extending into the left masticator space and infratemporal fossa, along with erosion of the left mandibular condyle and enlarged lymph nodes, further support this diagnosis. The presence of metabolically active lymphadenopathy in the left mediastinum and intra-abdominal region suggests distant metastasis.

B: Check rapid plasma reagin, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and lead level

Explanation: The patient's presentation with tingling and pain in the hands and feet, along with the loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, skin lesions, and lymphadenopathy, raises concern for a systemic condition. Checking rapid plasma reagin (RPR) is important to evaluate for syphilis, which can cause these findings. Additionally, checking thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is important to assess for thyroid dysfunction, which can also cause hair loss. Lead levels should be checked to evaluate for possible lead poisoning, which can cause neurological symptoms. These initial laboratory tests will help to establish a diagnosis and guide further management.

I would choose answer option D: Equestrian perniosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of working at a horse stable and riding for many hours a day suggests a possible exposure to cold temperatures, which can cause perniosis. The presentation of arcuate to circinate erythematous plaques on the bilateral posterior lateral thighs, along with focal areas of ulceration and scale-crust, further support the diagnosis of perniosis. The biopsy findings may also show features consistent with perniosis.

The answer option is:
B: Pyoderma gangrenosum.

Explanation:
Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, neutrophilic dermatosis that is often associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic disorders. It typically presents as painful, ulcerative skin lesions that are initially papules or pustules and progress to necrotic ulcers. The characteristic feature of pyoderma gangrenosum is its "pathergy phenomenon," where trauma or injury to the skin can trigger the development of new lesions. The clinical presentation, history of associated diseases, and absence of microbial growth on cultures are consistent with the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum in this case. A punch biopsy showing a neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of infection further supports this diagnosis. Treatment often involves systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.

1005
The answer is D: Nodular amyloid. 

Explanation: The clinical presentation, along with the histopathological features shown in the images, suggest the diagnosis of nodular amyloid. Nodular amyloid is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein within the dermis, forming nodules with a smooth and waxy appearance. The histopathology of nodular amyloid typically shows a diffuse infiltrate of pale eosinophilic material with prominent clefts, as seen in the hematoxylin-eosin stain (Figure B). Congo red staining (Figure C) is used to confirm the presence of amyloid, as it will exhibit apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Nodular amyloid can occur in various locations, including the skin, and may be associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as diabetes.

1006
The correct answer is B: Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

Explanation: 

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis that commonly affects children, but can also occur in adolescents and adults. It is characterized by a triad of symptoms including palpable purpura, arthralgias, and abdominal pain. Other common features include renal involvement and occasionally, gastrointestinal bleeding.

In this case, the patient presented with bilateral lower extremity edema, ecchymosis, and arthralgias. The presence of palpable purpura, petechiae, and scattered hemorrhages on examination support the diagnosis of HSP. The hemorrhagic gingivitis and asymmetric pitting edema further suggest a systemic vasculitic process. The associated symptoms of fatigue, decreased appetite, and abdominal discomfort are also consistent with HSP.

The laboratory findings in HSP typically include anemia, elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and sometimes hypoalbuminemia. The normal creatine kinase level and absence of coagulation abnormalities in this patient make hemorrhage secondary to trauma or bleeding disorder less likely.

Imaging findings of diffuse round mildly enhancing bone marrow lesions without vascular changes are not typical of HSP, but can be seen in some cases. However, the characteristic clinical findings and laboratory abnormalities strongly support the diagnosis of HSP in this case.

My diagnosis for this case is:

D: Fecal impaction due to opium addiction.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of constant abdominal pain, lack of bowel movements, and passing gas normally are consistent with fecal impaction. The absence of abnormal intestinal air-fluid levels or free peritoneal air on the CT scan rules out gastrointestinal obstruction due to adhesion band or internal hernia. Body packing is not supported by the clinical presentation or history provided. Given that the patient denies substance abuse or addiction, fecal impaction due to opium addiction is the most likely cause of his symptoms.

cellvalue empty
1008
D: Nodular melanoma.

Explanation: The presentation of a rapidly growing, bleeding mass that is purplish, fungating, and friable with positive immunohistochemistry for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 is consistent with nodular melanoma. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. Nodular melanoma is a subtype of melanoma that typically presents as a rapidly growing nodule, often with bleeding or ulceration. The positive immunohistochemistry staining for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 confirms the melanocytic origin of the lesion. The palpable, hard mass in the left axilla suggests lymph node involvement, further supporting the diagnosis of nodular melanoma. Cavernous lymphangioma is a benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a soft, compressible mass and is not associated with the clinical findings described in this case. Nodular basal cell carcinoma is a type of non-melanoma skin cancer that typically presents as a small, raised, pearly or translucent nodule with telangiectasia and a central ulcer. Squamous cell carcinoma is another type of non-melanoma skin cancer that usually presents as a scaly, erythematous plaque or nodule with central ulceration. Neither of these options is consistent with the clinical findings described in this case.

1009
Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to choose B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dilated pulmonary artery on CT pulmonary angiogram are consistent with pulmonary hypertension. However, the significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery observed during coronary angiography suggests coronary artery disease. The patient's development of deep ST-segment depressions, chest and throat pain, and subsequent ventricular tachycardia indicate ischemia and potential myocardial infarction.

Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the recommended immediate intervention in this critical situation to restore blood flow to the heart and prevent further myocardial damage. Emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (option A) may be considered if stenting is not possible, but stenting is generally the preferred initial approach in acute coronary syndromes. Emergent closure of the atrial septal defect (option C) and pulmonic valve balloon valvotomy (option D) may be addressed following stabilization of the patient's acute coronary syndrome.
API request failed on attempt 1. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery.

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with worsening symptoms, diffuse narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and the development of ST-segment depressions and chest pain during the procedure, it is likely that the left main coronary artery stenosis is causing myocardial ischemia. This is further supported by the resolution of symptoms after administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the most appropriate intervention to restore blood flow and relieve the ischemia.

B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery.

Explanation: The patient presented with diffuse narrowing of the left main coronary artery, which was causing significant cardiac symptoms, including deep ST-segment depressions, pain, and ventricular tachycardia. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the most appropriate intervention to relieve the stenosis and restore blood flow to the heart. This procedure should be prioritized over other interventions such as closure of the atrial septal defect, pulmonic valve balloon valvotomy, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, as immediate relief of the coronary artery obstruction is crucial to prevent further cardiac complications.

The diagnosis is C: Thyroid cartilage fracture.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including sudden voice change, odynophagia, and neck pain following a sneeze, along with tenderness over the thyroid notch and left side of the laryngotracheal complex, are indicative of a thyroid cartilage fracture. The popping sensation during the sneeze and subsequent neck stiffness suggest an acute injury. Flexible laryngoscopy showed hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, which further supports the diagnosis. CT imaging could be obtained to confirm the fracture. Ruptured vocal fold hemangioma, rupture of laryngocele, and traumatic intubation are less likely given the lack of relevant medical history or trauma.
C
1011
The diagnosis is D: Dehiscent carotid canal.

Explanation: This case presents a patient with objective tinnitus and vertigo episodes. On physical examination, objective, intermittent, clicking tinnitus at a frequency of 1 click per second was noted. The patient's prior imaging, including a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head, was normal.

During middle ear exploration, incidental findings were observed, which are shown in the intraoperative photograph. These findings, along with the multiplanar reconstructions of the CT image, reveal a dehiscent carotid canal (arrows). This finding suggests that the patient's symptoms may be related to pulsatile tinnitus caused by the close proximity of the carotid artery to the middle ear.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D: Dehiscent carotid canal.
B
1012
The correct answer is C: Glomus tumor.

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient presented with a cervical tracheal mass that was incidentally found on imaging, but she did not experience any associated symptoms such as dyspnea, hoarseness, dysphagia, hemoptysis, or chest pain. Flexible fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy revealed a smooth hypervascular mass arising from the posterior membranous trachea. The patient underwent tracheostomy and complete excision of the mass, and histopathologic images confirmed the diagnosis of a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare neoplasms arising from glomus bodies, which are involved in the regulation of blood flow. They are typically benign and hypervascular, and can occur in various locations, including the head and neck region.
C
1013
The answer is C: Fibrovascular polyp.

Explanation: Based on the description of the intraluminal tubular mass extending through the entire esophagus, along with the necrotic polypoid lesion protruding from the esophagogastric junction, and the CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is a fibrovascular polyp. Fibrovascular polyps are rare, benign lesions that typically arise in the hypopharynx or cervical esophagus. They are composed of fibrous and vascularized connective tissue, covered by squamous and respiratory epithelium. These polyps can have a variable presentation, but they can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and bleeding.

Squamous papilloma is another benign lesion, but it typically presents as a solitary or multiple exophytic mass in the larynx, vocal cords, or oropharynx. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, but it is less likely in this case given the description and location of the lesion. Lipomas are rare in the esophagus, and they usually present as submucosal masses.
C
1014
C: Obtain carotid Doppler

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a retinal vascular disorder, specifically central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). However, it is important to rule out any underlying systemic causes that may contribute to this condition. Obtaining a carotid Doppler ultrasound will help assess the blood flow in the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the retina. This can help identify any potential underlying carotid artery disease, such as atherosclerosis or stenosis, which may be contributing to the CRVO.

B: Corneal topography

Explanation: Corneal topography is the appropriate next step in evaluating this patient. Corneal topography can provide detailed information about the curvature and shape of the cornea, which can help identify the cause of the bilateral blurred vision. This test can assist in diagnosing conditions such as corneal ectasia, keratoconus, or corneal edema. By analyzing the corneal topography, the ophthalmologist can determine if surgical intervention such as Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty is necessary or if conservative management and observation are appropriate. Additionally, corneal topography can help monitor the patient's condition and assess the effectiveness of any treatment that is initiated.

B: Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits and maxillofacial region

Explanation: Given the patient's persistent symptoms and the presence of a peripherally enhancing mass on the computed tomographic scan, it is important to further evaluate the extent and nature of the mass using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI can provide detailed images of soft tissues, including the orbit and periorbital region, which can help identify the characteristics of the mass and guide further management decisions.

B: Genetic testing.

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms, including vision loss, dysarthria, balance difficulties, and slowed saccades, suggest a progressive neurologic disorder. The retinal abnormalities and abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) findings also indicate a retinal degenerative process. Given the patient's age, the absence of acute vision changes after the concussion, and the lack of a family history of inherited retinal degeneration, genetic testing should be pursued to evaluate for potential inherited retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. This can help identify any specific genetic mutations and aid in diagnosis and management. Further neurological and auditory evaluations may also be warranted, but genetic testing is the most appropriate initial step in this case.
B

1018
Based on the information provided, the correct answer is B: Plaque psoriasis.

Explanation: The description of the yellow hyperkeratotic plaques on the patient's lower extremities is consistent with plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition characterized by raised red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells. The presence of pruritus (itchiness) also supports the diagnosis of psoriasis.

The other options, A: Squamous cell carcinoma, C: Hypertrophic lichen planus, and D: Keratoacanthoma, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and the information provided. Squamous cell carcinoma typically presents as a tumor or ulcer rather than hyperkeratotic plaques. Hypertrophic lichen planus usually presents as thickened, flat-topped papules that are violaceous in color and typically not hyperkeratotic. Keratoacanthoma typically presents as a rapidly growing dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin-filled crater, which is different from the description provided in the case.

The answer is D: Diagnose refractory CDI and consider fecal microbiota transplantation.

Explanation: The patient initially presented with symptoms of CDI and was successfully treated with metronidazole. However, six weeks later, he had a recurrence of symptoms and a positive stool test for C difficile toxin PCR. This suggests that the infection has returned and may be refractory to treatment with metronidazole alone. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a potential treatment option for refractory CDI, as it can help restore the normal balance of bacteria in the gut and eradicate C difficile. Therefore, considering FMT would be the appropriate next step in management.

A: Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome

Explanation: Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of multiple blue or purple papules or nodules on the skin, especially on the extremities and face. These lesions often have a cobblestone-like appearance. They are caused by dilated and malformed veins in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The lesions are usually painful, and the pain can worsen throughout the day. The ability to compress the lesions may vary, with some being partially compressible. Duplex ultrasonography and skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis. Other features of BRBNS may include gastrointestinal involvement with venous malformations, which can lead to bleeding and anemia. Genetic mutations have been associated with BRBNS, although the exact cause is not fully understood.

Based on the clinical presentation of multiple facial papules that have been present since childhood and have progressively increased in number, as well as the involvement of other body parts and the presence of similar lesions in a sibling, the most likely diagnosis is Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (Answer A).

Explanation: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign skin tumors called fibrofolliculomas. These papules typically appear during adulthood, but in some cases, they may be present since childhood. The lesions are usually small, skin-colored or erythematous, and located on the face, neck, and upper trunk. 

In this case, the clinical presentation of multiple facial papules that have been present since childhood and are progressively increasing in number, along with the involvement of other body parts and a similar presentation in the sibling, strongly suggests Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. The histopathological findings of the biopsy samples would likely show features consistent with fibrofolliculomas. However, further investigations would be needed to confirm the diagnosis, such as genetic testing to identify mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.
B: Paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum

Explanation:
Based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum. The presence of chronic ulcers at surgical sites and on the back, along with an ill-appearing patient and elevated inflammatory markers, is highly suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum. Additionally, the positive c-ANCA testing and CT scan findings of sinusitis further support this diagnosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is known to be associated with systemic diseases, including malignancies such as lung cancer. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of the underlying malignancy is crucial in managing pyoderma gangrenosum.

The correct answer is D: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

Explanation: This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of acute onset severe neck pain progressing to weakness and sensory impairment in the arm and leg, along with imaging findings. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a spinal cord lesion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra, as seen on MRI. The multiple abnormal signals throughout the brain on MRI also indicate cerebral involvement. The laboratory findings are suggestive of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory response, with elevated protein and lactate levels.

Amyloid angiopathy typically presents with intracranial hemorrhages, which are not described in this case. Multiple cavernous malformations would present with multiple well-defined vascular lesions, which are not visualized on the brain MRI. Metastatic melanoma would present with similar symptoms, but it is less likely given the lack of a known primary melanoma and the pattern of brain and spinal cord lesions seen on MRI.

B: Eczema herpeticum

Explanation: The presentation of discrete clusters of monomorphic pink to violaceous papulovesicles with surrounding erythema is suggestive of eczema herpeticum. Eczema herpeticum is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that occurs in patients with pre-existing eczema or dermatitis. It typically presents as grouped vesicles or papules on an erythematous base, commonly seen in areas affected by eczema. The central punctate hemorrhagic crust seen in this case is also consistent with herpetic infection. Other options such as microcystic lymphatic malformation, herpes zoster, and hypersensitivity reaction do not fit the clinical presentation described.

B: Eczema herpeticum

Explanation: Eczema herpeticum is a cutaneous viral infection that occurs in individuals with pre-existing eczema. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and typically presents with clustered vesicles or papulovesicles with surrounding erythema. The lesions can be painful and may have a central punctate hemorrhagic crust. In this case, the patient had a recent influenza vaccination, which could have served as a trigger for the development of eczema herpeticum. It is important to consider this diagnosis and perform appropriate testing, such as viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to confirm HSV infection and guide treatment.

The correct answer is D: Leiomyosarcoma.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is leiomyosarcoma. The patient presented with abdominal discomfort, a large umbilical hernia, early satiety, night sweats, and weight loss, which are all concerning for a retroperitoneal mass. The laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia are consistent with the presence of a large tumor. The imaging studies showed a 25-cm retroperitoneal mass encasing the left kidney, indicative of a malignant tumor.

Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of smooth muscle origin that can occur in various locations, including the retroperitoneum. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms and can be associated with a mass effect on adjacent organs.

Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy that typically presents with symptoms related to excess hormone production or mass effect on adjacent structures. Liposarcoma is a soft tissue tumor that typically presents as a painless, slow-growing mass. Lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system and typically presents with lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms (such as fever and night sweats), and organ involvement. None of these diagnoses would explain the patient's specific clinical findings and imaging findings.

A: Cecal volvulus

Explanation: Cecal volvulus occurs when the cecum, a part of the large intestine, twists upon itself, causing a blockage and impaired blood supply to the intestine. This can lead to acute abdominal pain, distension, and tenderness. In this case, the abdominal examination revealed a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant, consistent with cecal volvulus. Abdominopelvic computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis by showing the dilated cecum. Treatment typically involves emergency surgery to correct the volvulus and restore blood flow to the affected area.

1028
B: Lymph node biopsy

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation of bilateral recurrent gingivitis, reactive lymphadenopathy, and negative infectious and cytologic studies, a lymph node biopsy would be the next appropriate step in the evaluation. This could help determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and aid in guiding further management. Biopsy of the iris nodule may also be considered, but given the extensive lymphadenopathy, a lymph node biopsy would be a more comprehensive approach. Antibiotic treatment with intravitreal vancomycin and ceftrazidime may be considered as a supportive treatment, but it would not address the underlying cause. Obtaining bacterial and fungal blood cultures would not be the primary next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms appear to be localized to the eyes and lymph nodes.

C: Obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement

Explanation: Given the patient's history of mitral valve replacement, the presence of severely restricted leaflet movement and elevated gradient across the prosthesis on echocardiogram, and the development of hemodynamic instability and refractory pulmonary edema, there is a high suspicion for prosthetic valve dysfunction. IV unfractionated heparin or thrombolysis may be considered for prosthetic valve thrombosis if the patient is stable, but in this case, the patient is unstable and surgical intervention is warranted. Therefore, obtaining a consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement is the most appropriate next step.

Answer: B: Tracheocele

Explanation: Based on the imaging findings and histopathologic analysis, the expansile mass identified at the level of the thoracic inlet is consistent with a tracheocele. Tracheoceles are cystic dilations of the trachea that arise from the disruption of the mucosal lining of the trachea, allowing air to accumulate within the cystic cavity. In this case, the tracheocele is likely a result of the previous surgical intervention in the central compartment, specifically the total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection. The communication of the tracheocele with the right posterolateral aspect of the trachea is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The correct diagnosis is B: Granular cell tumor. 

Explanation: Granular cell tumors are rare neoplasms that can occur in various locations, including the larynx. They are benign in nature and arise from Schwann cells. In this case, the submucosal mass found on laryngoscopy, as well as the histological findings of spindle cells with angulated nuclei in a stroma of variable coarse collagen and loose myxoid matrix, are consistent with a granular cell tumor. The brown macules on the skin also suggest the possibility of multiple cutaneous granular cell tumors, which can be associated with this type of tumor. Laryngeal sarcoidosis, laryngeal rhabdomyosarcoma, and laryngeal neurofibroma are less likely given the clinical and histological findings in this case.
D
1032
The correct answer is C: Mucus retention cyst.

Explanation: The patient's history and imaging findings are consistent with a mucus retention cyst in the right sublingual space following the Wharton duct. The initial excision of the submandibular gland likely led to altered drainage of saliva, resulting in the formation of a cyst. The recurrent floor of mouth swelling and subsequent excision of the sublingual gland further support the diagnosis. Pathologic analysis confirmed the presence of a cystic structure with compressed granulation tissue, consistent with mucous extravasation.
A
1033
Answer: C: Pseudomembranous epiglottitis

Explanation: 
Based on the patient's symptoms (sore throat, dysphagia, dyspnea, dysphonia, and neck pain), the presence of erythema, edema, and patchy necrosis of the epiglottis, and findings from flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, the most likely diagnosis is pseudomembranous epiglottitis. Pseudomembranous epiglottitis is a rare condition characterized by inflammation and infection of the epiglottis, most commonly caused by Candida species. It typically presents with rapid progression of symptoms and airway compromise. Treatment usually involves antifungal therapy and airway management, which may include intubation or tracheostomy.
D
1034
B: Check antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme.

Explanation: Given the patient's presenting symptoms of decreased vision, cognitive decline, and retinal abnormalities, it is important to pursue further diagnostic testing to identify potential underlying causes. This includes checking for autoimmune markers such as antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, which can help determine if there are any autoimmune or inflammatory disorders contributing to the patient's condition. Additionally, checking angiotensin-converting enzyme levels can help evaluate for the possibility of sarcoidosis, which can also present with ocular manifestations.

C: Refer for magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of retinal detachment in her father, as well as her own ocular findings, including engorged vessels, tractional retinal detachment, and orange masses in the peripheral retina, the next step in the management of this patient would be to refer her for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This is to evaluate for the presence of any underlying tumors or masses, which may be causing her symptoms of foggy vision and headaches. Genetic testing can also be considered later on, depending on the findings of the MRI. However, conducting a complete blood cell count or performing a retinal biopsy would not be necessary at this stage.

I would choose answer option B: Add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with fever, weakness, dyspnea, tachycardia, increased work of breathing, and bibasilar crackles on examination, along with the bilateral ground glass opacities on chest CT, is consistent with a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). This is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, especially those who have undergone stem cell transplantation. The presence of graft-vs-host disease and high-dose prednisone further increase the patient's risk for PJP. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice for PJP, and corticosteroids are often added to reduce inflammation. Therefore, adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids would be the appropriate next step in management.

1037
The diagnosis is C: Leukemia cutis.

Explanation:
Leukemia cutis refers to the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin. In this case, the patient presented with skin bumps on the forearm and calf, which were found to be infiltrated with large mononuclear cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio on histologic evaluation. Immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD4 cells and myeloperoxidase, further supporting the diagnosis of leukemia cutis.

The negative work-up for infectious causes, absence of peripheral blasts on complete blood cell counts, and the patient's history of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia all point towards leukemia cutis as the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Answer: D: The patient does not have a clotting factor inhibitor.

Explanation: A mixing study is performed to evaluate for the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor. In this case, the mixing study results suggest that there is no significant correction of the prolonged clotting time after mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma. This indicates that the patient's clotting abnormality is not due to the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor.

D: Perform a diagnostic test to clarify the diagnosis.

Explanation: It is important to perform a diagnostic test to clarify the diagnosis before initiating any treatment. The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a possible fungal infection, but it is necessary to confirm the presence of a fungal infection through laboratory tests such as a fungal culture or a microscopic examination of nail clippings. This will help in determining the appropriate treatment approach for the patient's long-standing onychodystrophy.

The correct answer is A: Amelanotic melanoma.

Explanation: Longitudinal erythronychia refers to the presence of longitudinal red or pink bands or streaks in the nail. It is a concerning finding that can be associated with various nail disorders, including benign conditions like onychopapilloma and glomus tumor, as well as malignant conditions like squamous cell carcinoma in situ and amelanotic melanoma.

In this case, the patient's history of a chronic split in the nail, intermittent pain, and exacerbation of symptoms by cold weather raises suspicion of a malignant etiology. The presence of longitudinal erythronychia further supports the diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma, as melanomas can sometimes lack pigmentation and present with red or pink discoloration.

Furthermore, the MRI findings of a nail matrix lesion and the histopathological analysis of the excised specimen can confirm the diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma.

It is important to note that amelanotic melanomas can be challenging to diagnose and may be easily overlooked, as they lack the characteristic pigmentation. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial for improving outcomes in patients with melanomas. Therefore, referral to a specialist or dermatologist is necessary for further evaluation and management.

The correct answer is: A: Superficial spreading melanoma

Explanation: The patient's presentation with diffuse progressive proliferation of dark papules, along with the presence of pruritic and removable lesions, is characteristic of superficial spreading melanoma. The fact that the lesions initially appeared after a sunburn suggests a possible triggering event. The histopathologic examination revealed a circumscribed proliferation of pigmented epithelioid melanocytic nests with moderate cytologic atypia, consistent with melanoma. The lack of melanocytic confluence at the dermal-epidermal junction seen on the Melan-A immunostain also supports the diagnosis of melanoma. Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi, dermatosis papulosa nigra, and metastatic melanoma are not consistent with the clinical and histopathologic findings in this case.

1042
The correct answer is D: Verrucous hemangioma.

Explanation:
Based on the provided clinical photograph and histopathological examination results, the most likely diagnosis is a verrucous hemangioma. Verrucous hemangioma is a rare, congenital vascular malformation characterized by slow-growing, erythematous plaques with verrucous or wartlike features. It typically presents in childhood or early adulthood and commonly affects the lower extremities.

The clinical presentation of a large, verrucous plaque with wartlike features, history of recurrent infections, and oozing and bleeding after minimal trauma is consistent with a verrucous hemangioma. The soft, compressible nodules overlying the plaque further support the diagnosis.

Histopathological examination of the deep punch biopsy specimen shows epidermal verrucous hyperplasia, acanthosis, papillomatosis, and hyperkeratosis. Additionally, dilated vessels are seen in the dermis, extending deep to the base of the specimen. These findings are indicative of a vascular malformation, confirming the diagnosis of verrucous hemangioma.

The negative D2-40 stain also helps to rule out a lymphatic malformation, which can have a similar clinical appearance.

B: Tuberculous spondylitis

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this 11-year-old boy with intermittent, worsening lower back pain, especially that wakes him from sleep, along with the presence of a paravertebral mass, destruction of ribs, compression fractures, and bony erosion of vertebrae seen on imaging are suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis. Tuberculous spondylitis, also known as Pott's disease, is a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that affects the spine. It commonly presents with back pain, especially at night, and can lead to bony destruction, abscess formation, and spinal deformities.

Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that usually occurs in children and adolescents, but it typically presents with localized pain and a soft tissue mass. The presence of fever, weight loss, cough, or rash would be uncommon in Ewing sarcoma.

Discitis is an infection or inflammation of the intervertebral discs and is usually associated with a recent history of trauma or infection. Fever and elevated inflammatory markers are typically seen with discitis.

Pyogenic osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone, which can occur at any age. While it can cause back pain and bony destruction, it is less likely to present with paravertebral abscesses and involvement of multiple vertebrae as seen in this case.

Given the history, clinical findings, and imaging findings, tuberculous spondylitis is the most likely diagnosis.

The correct answer is B: Thymolipoma.

Explanation: Thymolipoma is a rare benign tumor composed primarily of mature adipose tissue (fat). It is considered a variant of thymoma, which is a tumor originating from the thymus gland. Thymolipomas typically present as anterior mediastinal masses and can compress adjacent structures, such as the heart. They often contain areas of nodular soft tissue elements, which can sometimes be mistaken for malignant components. However, in this case, the tumor marker levels were within reference ranges, further supporting the benign nature of the mass. Thymolipomas are typically managed with surgical resection.

The answer is C: Prolonged ileus secondary to retained intraluminal old blood.

Explanation: The patient presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and underwent unsuccessful endoscopic treatment followed by embolization of a right colic artery branch. Despite the successful embolization, the patient developed abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and right lower quadrant tenderness. These symptoms are indicative of an ileus, which is a functional obstruction of the intestines. In this case, the prolonged ileus is likely due to the presence of retained intraluminal old blood. This is supported by the history of rectal bleeding and poor colonoscopy visualization with fresh blood and clots noted in the ascending colon. The computed tomographic angiogram also showed pooling of contrast in the right colon, suggesting the presence of blood in the intestinal lumen. Therefore, choice C is the correct diagnosis.

B: Initiate uveitis workup and begin topical glucocorticoid therapy 

Explanation: The patient presents with reduced visual acuity in the right eye along with other ocular findings such as conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber cells, vitreous haze, optic disc edema, and chorioretinal lesions with hemorrhage. These findings suggest uveitis, which is inflammation within the eye. Uveitis can be caused by various underlying systemic conditions, infections, or autoimmune diseases. Given the patient's recent history of urologic procedures and subsequent systemic symptoms, it would be prudent to initiate an uveitis workup to investigate for any underlying infectious or systemic etiologies. This can include blood tests, imaging studies, and consultation with other specialists as needed. Additionally, topical glucocorticoid therapy can help reduce ocular inflammation and manage the patient's symptoms. Options A, C, and D are not indicated initially in this case.

The answer is B: Test the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1.

Explanation: Given the patient's history and clinical findings, including corneal changes and iridocorneal touch, there is a suspicion of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Testing the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. HSV-1 is a common cause of anterior uveitis and can lead to the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and corneal changes.

1048
B: Start systemic corticosteroids. 

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of unilateral proptosis, redness, diplopia, numbness, and the imaging findings of extraocular muscle enlargement and enhancement, as well as a dilated superior ophthalmic vein, the most likely diagnosis is orbital inflammatory syndrome. This is a condition characterized by inflammation of the orbital tissues, including the muscles and blood vessels. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for orbital inflammatory syndrome and can help reduce inflammation and related symptoms. Orbital biopsy may be considered if there is a concern for a specific underlying cause, but it is not the first-line approach in this case. Systemic antibiotics would not be appropriate since there are no signs of infection. Catheter cerebral angiography would not be necessary as there is no evidence of an arteriovenous fistula or vascular abnormality.

B: Computed tomography scan of the orbits without contrast

Explanation: Given the patient's history of trauma and the presence of a white cataract along with other symptoms such as tearing, photophobia, and burning, it is important to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits without contrast can help evaluate the structures of the eye, including the lens and surrounding tissues, and identify any potential abnormalities or complications from the trauma. This will provide additional information to guide further management and treatment options.

The Answer: D: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Explanation: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome, is a transient disorder characterized by acute regional left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. It is typically triggered by a stressful event and can present with symptoms similar to myocardial infarction, such as chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes. In this case, the patient developed acute pulmonary edema and new cardiomegaly with biventricular failure after the lung transplantation. The electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes with T-wave inversion, and transesophageal echocardiography revealed dilation of the left ventricle with reduced ejection fraction and global hypokinesis, which are characteristic features of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This diagnosis is supported by the absence of atherosclerosis on pretransplantation coronary angiography and negative cardiac enzyme levels.

The correct answer is A: Solitary fibrous tumor. 

Explanation: The key features in this case that point towards a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor include a subcutaneous mass infiltrating the parotid gland, spindle cell tumor histopathology with a storiform pattern, diffuse positivity for CD34, and a t(17;22) translocation with COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (B) typically presents as a well-demarcated plaque or nodule on the trunk or extremities, with characteristic storiform pattern histopathology and a COL1A1/PDGFB fusion gene detected by FISH. Malignant melanoma (C) is an aggressive skin cancer that typically presents with pigmented skin lesions with asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, and enlargement. Spindle cell carcinoma (D) is a rare malignant tumor that can arise in various organs including the skin and salivary glands, but the clinical and histopathologic findings in this case are not consistent with spindle cell carcinoma.
B
1052
The answer is A: Bilateral otosclerosis.

Explanation: The patient presented with bilateral conductive hearing loss and delayed speech development. Initial examinations and imaging did not reveal any abnormalities. Genetic evaluation also did not show any abnormalities. The repeated CT scan of the temporal bones showed the characteristic findings of otosclerosis, with bilateral involvement of the bony otic capsule, resulting in fixation of the stapes footplate. This leads to conductive hearing loss as sound is not transmitted effectively to the inner ear. The patient and family decided to continue with hearing aids as the hearing loss was stable and there was improvement in school performance. Surgical treatment may be considered in the future if there is a decline in hearing.
B
1053
The correct answer is B: Supraglottic paraganglioma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of intermittent dysphagia, dry cough, foreign-body sensation in the throat, and dyspnea on effort along with the findings on oral endoscopic examination and fiber-optic laryngoscopy suggest a neoplasm in the supraglottic area. The characteristic feature of this case is the highly vascularized appearance of the neoplasm, as seen on narrowband imaging and confirmed on contrast MRI. This vascular pattern is a characteristic feature of paragangliomas. Surgical excision using transoral robotic-assisted surgery (da Vinci robotic system) was performed, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Supraglottic hemangioma, rhabdomyoma of the epiglottis, and laryngeal squamous papilloma are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.
B
1054
Answer: C: Parathyroid lipoadenoma 

Explanation: The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest primary hyperparathyroidism. However, the normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and the absence of a definitive lesion on imaging make parathyroid adenoma less likely. Parathyroid lipohyperplasia is characterized by nonencapsulated parathyroid glands with varying amounts of adipose tissue. In this case, there is an ovoid soft tissue mass consistent with parathyroid lipoadenoma. The presence of intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles on intraoperative touch preparation and the histological findings support the diagnosis. Parathyroid carcinoma is excluded based on the histologic features and absence of invasion into adjacent structures.
C
1055
The correct diagnosis is B: Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

Explanation: Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PCALCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma primarily involving the skin. It commonly presents as solitary or grouped erythematous papules, nodules, plaques, or tumors. PCALCL usually affects adults and is characterized by cytotoxic CD30-positive T lymphocytes with atypical morphology, as seen in the pathology findings. It is a distinct entity from systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, which involves lymph nodes and extracutaneous sites. The absence of systemic involvement and negative T-cell receptor gene rearrangement supports the diagnosis of PCALCL in this case. Treatment typically involves local therapies such as surgery, radiation, or topical therapies. Systemic therapy may be considered for extensive or relapsing disease.

1056
Answer: C: The patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and does not need a repeat testing of a TSH level.

Explanation: Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a mildly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with normal free thyroxine (T4) levels. In this case, the patient's TSH level is elevated at 7.5 mIU/L (reference range: 0.45-4.5 mIU/L), while her free T4 level is within the normal range at 1.0 ng/dL (reference range: 0.8-1.8 ng/dL).

The patient's symptoms of hair thinning, itchy scalp, and cold sensitivity are suggestive of hypothyroidism. Additionally, her body mass index indicates obesity, which is commonly associated with subclinical hypothyroidism. However, she does not have other typical symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, depression, memory problems, dry skin, or constipation.

Since the TSH level is already elevated, there is no need to repeat the test in 1 to 3 months. Instead, further evaluation and treatment may be considered based on the patient's clinical symptoms and risk factors.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to choose option C: Start parenteral thiamine.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, specifically the nystagmus, lower extremity hyperalgesia, and memory impairment, along with the abnormal signals seen on brain MRI, suggest a thiamine deficiency or Wernicke encephalopathy. This condition can occur in patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, or prolonged intravenous therapy without thiamine supplementation. It is important to administer parenteral thiamine promptly to prevent progression to irreversible neurologic damage. Option A (intravenous acyclovir) would be considered if the patient's symptoms were consistent with viral encephalitis, which is not indicated in this case. Option B (intravenous thrombolysis) would be considered for acute ischemic stroke, which does not fit with the patient's symptoms. Option D (systemic corticosteroids) is not appropriate in this situation.

Answer: A: Guttata hypomelanosis

Explanation: Guttata hypomelanosis is a common benign skin condition characterized by multiple small, hypopigmented macules. These macules typically appear on sun-exposed areas such as the face and arms. The lesions are usually round or oval and can range in size from a few millimeters to centimeters in diameter. They are symmetrically distributed and can gradually coalesce over time. There is no associated hair loss or other symptoms. Guttata hypomelanosis is commonly mistaken for other conditions such as vitiligo or tinea versicolor, however, a skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options for guttata hypomelanosis include topical corticosteroids, retinoids, or cryotherapy for cosmetic purposes.

Based on the given information and the clinical features, the correct answer is C: Antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis.

Explanation: The patient presents with several symptoms including fatigue, exertional dyspnea, arthralgias, hand swelling, tender ulcerations, hair loss, and weight loss. These symptoms, along with the physical examination findings, suggest a connective tissue disease. However, the negative findings for various antibodies and normal imaging results rule out other possibilities such as Sarcoidosis, lymphoma syndrome, Immunoglobulin G4-related disease, and Systemic lupus erythematosus.

The presence of MDA5 antibodies, normal aldolase levels, and muscle strength being 5 of 5 throughout, indicate that the patient has antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis.

It is important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario and a proper diagnosis should be made by a medical professional after a thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms, medical history, and additional diagnostic tests.

The correct answer is C: Crystal-storing histiocytosis.

Explanation: Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of crystals within histiocytes, leading to tissue damage. In this case, the patient's history of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, bone marrow infiltration, and IgM-κ paraproteinemia suggests the possibility of crystal-storing histiocytosis. The biopsy findings of deeply eosinophilic cells with interstitial infiltrate in the dermis and subcutis further support this diagnosis. Crystal-storing histiocytosis can occur in various organs, including the skin, and can present with erythema and other skin manifestations. Other options, such as Wells syndrome, cutaneous amyloidosis, and erysipelas, do not explain the characteristic histopathological findings observed in this case.

Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for this case is B: Urea cycle disorder.

Explanation: The patient's recurrent coma episodes, elevated ammonia levels, and rapid decline in mental status despite treatment with lactulose are indicative of a urea cycle disorder. Urea cycle disorders are a group of metabolic disorders that impair the body's ability to break down nitrogen waste products, leading to hyperammonemia. The symptoms can range from mild to severe and may be triggered by factors like illness, fasting, or increased protein intake. The fact that the patient did not improve with lactulose and required hemodialysis suggests a severe presentation of the disorder. Additional testing with plasma amino acids and urine organic acids would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

B: Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The patient presented with fever, sore throat, periorbital edema, eyelid ecchymoses, and bilateral conjunctival hemorrhage. These symptoms are consistent with those seen in infectious mononucleosis, which is commonly caused by EBV infection. The positive rapid antigen detection test for group A Streptococcus is likely a false positive, as it is known to have a high rate of false-positive results. The patient also did not have typical findings of streptococcal pharyngitis, such as exudative tonsillitis or palatal petechiae. The laboratory findings, including leukocytosis with lymphocytic predominance, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, are consistent with EBV infection. Additionally, the patient had completed a course of antibiotics for acute otitis media, making streptococcal infection less likely. Neuroblastoma and viral hepatitis are less likely given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.

1063
The correct answer is C: Blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of longstanding dyspnea on exertion, chest discomfort, and episodes of small-volume emesis, in addition to the findings on imaging, suggest a diaphragmatic hernia. The presence of bowel sounds on chest auscultation further supports this diagnosis. In this case, the patient's history of a motorcycle crash with a brief loss of consciousness suggests a potential blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm as the cause of the hernia. A type IV hiatal hernia is not likely given the absence of symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux or heartburn. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia usually presents in infancy and is unlikely in an adult patient without a history of neonatal respiratory distress. Diaphragm eventration is a condition characterized by a thin and elevated diaphragm, which would not explain the large air-fluid level seen on imaging.

B: Apical aneurysm with thrombus formation

Explanation: The patient's history of myocardial infarction, the presence of tachycardia, tachypnea, and bilateral rales, along with the persistent ST-T segment elevation on ECG, are suggestive of complications related to the previous myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography findings demonstrate a hypoechoic mass and a hypodense lesion surrounding the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle and apex, consistent with an apical aneurysm. Thrombus formation within the aneurysm can explain the patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea at rest and the faint S1 and S2 heart sounds.

Answer: C: Prescribe oral aciclovir

Explanation: The presentation of target lesions, burning sensation, and involvement of the conjunctiva suggest a viral etiology, most likely herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Therefore, prescribing oral aciclovir would be the most appropriate course of action. Aciclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against HSV, and can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Additionally, it is important to start treatment early to prevent complications and minimize the risk of spread to other individuals. Antibiotics like flucloxacillin would not be effective against a viral infection, and cimetidine is not indicated in this case. Observing without treatment may lead to worsening of symptoms and potential complications.

Answer: C

Explanation: The most appropriate next step in this case would be to start topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops. The patient's symptoms, including photophobia and punctate keratitis, suggest the presence of a corneal surface disorder, such as superficial punctate keratitis. Topical steroids can help reduce inflammation, while cyclosporine A can help improve tear film stability and reduce symptoms of dryness. This treatment approach is often effective in managing symptoms related to surface disorders of the cornea. A follow-up evaluation should be scheduled to assess the patient's response to treatment. Electroretinogram and corneal cultures are not indicated based on the clinical presentation described, and observation alone without intervention would not address the patient's symptoms.
I would choose option A: Continue anticoagulation and monitor closely in an outpatient clinical setting.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of transverse sinus thrombosis and the worsening symptoms, it is likely that the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has extended and caused mastoiditis. This can lead to otitis media and subsequent worsening of symptoms such as headache, blurred vision, and nausea. Continuing anticoagulation is important to treat the thrombosis, and close monitoring in an outpatient clinical setting will allow for observation of the patient's progress and response to treatment. Lumbar puncture or radical mastoidectomy may not be necessary at this point and should be considered if symptoms worsen or do not improve with conservative management.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Horner syndrome, which may be caused by a lesion affecting the sympathetic pathway in the brain, brainstem, or cervical region. To identify the underlying cause, further imaging studies such as MRI and MRA of the brain and cervical spine are necessary. These tests can help identify any anatomical abnormalities or lesions that may be responsible for the patient's symptoms. Performing a lumbar puncture may not be necessary at this time as there are no clinical indications for it. An apraclonidine test may be used to confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome but is not necessary in this case. Ordering tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and syphilis serologies may be considered later if there is suspicion of an infectious or inflammatory cause.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including left-sided hemibody paresthesia, dysphagia, ataxia, and binocular diplopia, suggest a possible central lesion involving the brain or cervical spine. It is important to rule out any structural abnormalities or vascular abnormalities that may be causing the Horner syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) will provide detailed images of the brain and cervical spine to evaluate for any abnormalities.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including hemibody paresthesia, dysphagia, ataxia, and diplopia, suggest a neurological issue. Horner syndrome, which is characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis, has been identified in the right eye. This syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic nerves of the eye. However, in this case, there are additional neurological symptoms that require further investigation with imaging studies (MRI and MRA) to evaluate the brain and cervical spine. These tests can help identify any structural abnormalities, tumors, or vascular issues that may be causing the symptoms.

I would choose answer option D: Perform serum and urine immunofixation and light chain determination.

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of progressive shortness of breath, elevated troponin levels, ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram, restricted diastolic filling with low ejection fraction, and the findings on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showing a sawtooth pattern of hyperenhancement in the left ventricular epicardium and myocardial edema, it is important to investigate the possibility of an underlying systemic disease causing cardiac involvement.

Performing serum and urine immunofixation and light chain determination can help identify any abnormal proteins or monoclonal gammopathies that may indicate the presence of an underlying systemic disorder such as amyloidosis or cardiac sarcoidosis. These tests can help guide further diagnostic and treatment decisions.

While positron emission tomographic/CT imaging may be useful in certain cases, the presence of extensive myocardial edema on CMR suggests active inflammation and the need for further investigation before considering steroid treatment. Close follow-up and providing medical treatment alone may not be sufficient without identifying and addressing the underlying cause. Initiation of steroid pulse therapy should be based on a confirmed diagnosis, which requires additional tests.

D: Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a painful swelling in the hard palate, along with malocclusion and upper lip numbness, suggests an aggressive tumor involving the maxillary bone. The imaging findings of a heterogeneously ossified lesion filling the left maxillary sinus, with local destruction of hard palate and alveolar bone, are consistent with an aggressive tumor. The positron emission tomographic scans showing fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nature of the tumor and associated cervical lymphadenopathy further support a malignant tumor. 

The histopathologic features of a tumor with lobular architecture, an incomplete peripheral ossified rim, focal areas of osteoid matrix, and atypical cells with increased mitotic activity in a myxoid stroma are consistent with a malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor. Immunostains were negative for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP, ruling out other differential diagnoses. Chondroblastic osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma are less likely based on the histopathologic findings. Malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland is also less likely since the lesion is originating from the maxillary bone.

My diagnosis is A: Lipoma.

Explanation: The description and images provided suggest a laryngeal mass with a pedunculated stalk originating from the left anterior false vocal fold. The pathologic examination reveals a mass with a papillary-like architecture, expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue (lipoma), and mild chronic submucosal inflammation. Lipomas are benign tumors composed of mature fat cells and can occur in various parts of the body, including the larynx. The clinical presentation, laryngoscopic findings, and histopathology support the diagnosis of a laryngeal lipoma.

B: Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery

Explanation: The findings on the CT and MRI scans, including the double-lined appearance of the sinus walls, bony defects next to the cavernous sinus, concentric multistratified appearance of the sinus content on MRI, and intense enhancement of the oval black area in the upper part of the sinus after gadolinium administration, are suggestive of an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness and headache.
B
1073
B: Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia

Explanation: The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic features are suggestive of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). ALHE is a benign vascular tumor characterized by infiltrating blood vessels with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including eosinophils. It typically presents as a slow-growing mass on the head and neck region, commonly affecting the parotid gland and surrounding lymph nodes. The histopathology of ALHE is characterized by thickened vessel walls with prominent endothelial cell proliferation, eosinophilic infiltrate, and fibrosis in the stroma. The presence of germinal centers with lytic changes and intrafollicular eosinophils is a characteristic feature but should not be mistaken for Castleman disease, which typically presents with highly hyalinized germinal centers. Kimura disease is another similar entity but typically presents with subcutaneous nodules and lymphadenopathy, along with a more pronounced eosinophilic infiltrate. Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia is a malignant tumor and the presence of normal facial nerve function makes it less likely in this case.
C
1074
Answer: C: Laryngeal saccular cyst

Explanation: The presentation of a right-sided submucosal mass expanding the aryepiglottic fold with hoarseness is consistent with a laryngeal saccular cyst. The cystic nature of the mass seen on CT scan, as well as the benign pathology findings, support this diagnosis. Laryngeal carcinoma would typically present with more concerning symptoms such as weight loss, dysphagia, and lymphadenopathy, and would have a different appearance on imaging and pathology. Laryngocele typically presents as a submucosal air-filled dilatation of the laryngeal saccule, which would not match the description of the mass in this case. Thyroid cartilage chondroma would present differently and typically occurs in older patients.
C
1075
The correct answer is C: Idelalisib-induced colitis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stools, along with the normal hematological, renal, and hepatic function, are consistent with drug-induced colitis. Idelalisib, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, is known to cause gastrointestinal toxicity, including colitis, in patients with lymphoma. The absence of infectious etiologies such as CMV infection, negative stool C. difficile toxin assay, and absence of pathogenic organisms on stool culture suggests that an infectious cause is less likely. The histopathology findings shown in the Figure are consistent with idelalisib-induced colitis. Lymphomatous polyposis is typically associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and is characterized by multiple polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Ischemic colitis would have a different clinical presentation and would be unlikely given the absence of risk factors such as advanced age, atherosclerosis, or use of vasoconstrictive drugs.

D: Swab lesions and send for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus (ie, hand-foot-mouth disease).

Explanation: In this case, the patient's presentation of painless blisters on the hands, presence of milia, and absence of pruritus or history of trauma or contact with allergens or irritants, along with the history of working outdoors, suggest a viral etiology. Hand-foot-mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus is a viral infection that typically affects children but can also occur in adults. It presents with vesicular eruptions on the hands, feet, and mouth. Swabbing the lesions and sending for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis.

D: Swab lesions and send for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus (ie, hand-foot-mouth disease).

Explanation: The patient's presentation with painless blisters on the hands, absence of pruritus or history of trauma or contact with allergens or irritants, and occupational exposure suggest a viral etiology. Coxsackievirus infection, particularly hand-foot-mouth disease, can present with vesicular eruptions on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa. Swabbing the lesions and sending for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus can help confirm the diagnosis. Other options (A, B, and C) are not indicated based on the given clinical presentation and would not be the next appropriate step in management.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
D: Swab lesions and send for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus (ie, hand-foot-mouth disease).

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of painless blisters on the hands, scattered erosions, and milia, along with the patient's occupational exposure and lack of pruritus or history of trauma, hand-foot-mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus should be considered. Swabbing the lesions and sending for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus can confirm the diagnosis. Other answer options are not consistent with the clinical presentation or indications for further testing.

The answer is D: The patient has antiglomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture syndrome).

Explanation: The presence of blood-streaked sputum, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, new bilateral opacities on chest x-ray, and diffuse crackles on examination suggest a pulmonary and renal involvement. The positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test, specifically the presence of anti-GBM antibodies, is highly specific for antiglomerular basement membrane (Goodpasture) disease. Goodpasture syndrome is characterized by the presence of antibodies against type IV collagen in the basement membrane of the kidney and lungs. This autoimmune disorder can lead to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.

A: Follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris

Explanation: The patient's presentation of folliculocentric, octagonal scaly papules is consistent with follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP). PRP is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by follicular hyperkeratosis, erythematous scaly plaques, and palmoplantar keratoderma. It typically affects the trunk and extremities and can present with varied morphology, including papules, plaques, and corn-like follicular hyperkeratotic lesions. The absence of systemic symptoms, as well as the benign course of individual lesions, differentiates PRP from other conditions such as lymphomatoid papulosis.

The correct answer is C: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.

Explanation: Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple cutaneous lesions, including fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, as well as an increased risk of developing renal tumors and pulmonary cysts. The skin nodules in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome typically appear on the face, neck, and upper torso. In this case, the patient presented with painful nodules on the lower extremities, neck, and jawline, and a biopsy of the jawline nodule confirmed the diagnosis. Neurofibromatosis type I is associated with café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and skinfold freckling. Reed syndrome, also known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome, is characterized by cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma. Tuberous sclerosis typically presents with facial angiofibromas, ash-leaf spots, and shagreen patches, as well as renal angiomyolipomas and intracranial hamartomas.
B

1080
D: Necrobiosis lipoidica

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a large annular plaque with raised borders and an atrophic and wrinkled center, as well as the absence of other mucosal or skin lesions, suggests the diagnosis of necrobiosis lipoidica. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a chronic granulomatous skin disorder that typically presents as erythematous plaques with raised borders and an atrophic center. It commonly affects the lower extremities but can rarely occur on the upper extremities as seen in this case. Biopsy findings, including the presence of necrobiotic collagen and chronic inflammation, can help confirm the diagnosis. Granuloma annulare, annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma, and annular lichen planus are less likely diagnoses based on the clinical presentation described in the case.
B

1081
The correct answer is A: Neonatal varicella syndrome.

Explanation: Neonatal varicella syndrome is caused by maternal varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection during pregnancy. In this case, the newborn presents with a diffuse, papulovesicular rash on the arms, legs, face, scalp, and trunk, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of varicella. The palms, soles, and oral mucosa being spared also support the diagnosis of VZV infection.
Other differential diagnoses can be ruled out based on the absence of certain clinical features. Disseminated herpes infection usually presents with a vesicular rash with involvement of the oral mucosa and/or genitalia, which is not seen in this case. Congenital syphilis can present with a diffuse rash, but it usually spares the palms and soles, which is not the case here. Langerhans cell histiocytosis typically presents with solitary skin lesions and would not explain the widespread rash seen in this patient.

1082
The diagnosis in this case is B: Gallstone ileus.

Explanation:
Gallstone ileus is a rare but serious complication of cholecystectomy, where a gallstone migrates from the gallbladder stump into the intestinal tract. The migrated gallstone can cause obstruction, typically in the small bowel, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and distension. CT imaging is often used to confirm the diagnosis, which typically shows evidence of intestinal obstruction and a gallstone in the bowel lumen.

In this case, the patient presented with progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which is consistent with gallstone ileus. The initial CT scan revealed a calcified mass in the left hemiabdomen, suggesting a lost gallstone. The subsequent CT scan likely showed evidence of intestinal obstruction and further supported the diagnosis of gallstone ileus.

Other answer options:
A: Intra-abdominal abscess - There is no mention of infection or signs of an abscess in the provided information.
C: Gallstone granuloma - This refers to chronic inflammation around a retained gallstone, but it does not explain the symptoms of progressive abdominal pain and obstruction in this case.
D: Eroded gallstone into the abdominal wall - This is not supported by the CT imaging findings, which show the gallstone within the intestinal lumen, not within the abdominal wall.
B

1083
The correct answer is C: Pancreatic pseudocyst.

Explanation: 
The patient's history of acute pancreatitis and prolonged alcohol abuse suggests that the abdominal lump is likely related to his pancreas. The physical examination findings of a nontender, nonpulsatile, fixed lump further support this. The routine blood test revealing leukocytosis is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in various conditions.

The CT scan of the abdomen shows a well-defined enhancing wall, encysting a homogeneous collection of fluid. This is consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common complication of pancreatitis and typically develop within 4-6 weeks after an episode of acute pancreatitis. They are fluid-filled collections that lack an epithelial lining, which differentiates them from true cysts. Pancreatic pseudocysts can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fullness, and discomfort.

Mesenteric cysts typically present as intra-abdominal masses that are mobile and compressible. Gastric duplication cysts appear as cystic structures in the gastric wall. Walled-off pancreatic necrosis is characterized by a collection of pancreatic necrotic debris surrounded by a wall of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells. None of these findings are consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case.

A: Continue to observe and hope the implant settles down or moves away from the visual axis.

Explanation: In this case, the patient complained about a large, linear "floater" in his central vision after receiving a fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant. Although the hope was that the implant would settle down or move out of the visual axis within 2 weeks, it did not happen. Therefore, the next step would be to continue observing the patient in the hope that the implant eventually settles down or moves away from the visual axis without any intervention. This approach is less invasive and allows for further evaluation of the patient's symptoms and the implant's impact on visual acuity before considering other treatment options.

1085
B: Schedule the patient for lensectomies with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation with bilateral lens dislocation into the anterior chamber with lenticulocorneal touch suggests ectopia lentis. This is a rare condition, often associated with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or homocystinuria. In this case, there are no apparent extraocular manifestations or relevant family history to suggest a connective tissue disease. However, given the high likelihood of underlying systemic disorder, it is prudent to proceed with definitive surgical management to prevent further complications such as corneal endothelial damage or glaucoma. Lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement would correct the refractive error and restore vision, and referral for connective tissue disease workup can be arranged after the surgery. Observing and reevaluating the patient in 2 months without surgical intervention may lead to worsening vision and potential complications. Pharmacologically redilating the pupils and positioning the patient supinely may provide temporary relief but do not address the underlying lens dislocation.

B: Examine under anesthesia with peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser

Explanation: The presenting symptoms of leukocoria and decreased vision, along with the findings on fundus examination of a dome-shaped, white-yellow mass lesion in the macula, are consistent with a possible diagnosis of retinoblastoma in this 2-year-old boy. To further diagnose and manage this condition, the next step would be to perform a comprehensive examination under anesthesia, including peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser treatment as necessary. This will provide a more detailed evaluation of the tumor and its extent, and guide further management options such as chemotherapy or enucleation if needed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits may be performed later to assess for metastasis, but it is not the next immediate step in the management of this patient. Intraocular injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medication may be considered in some cases of retinoblastoma, but it is not the next appropriate step in this case. Genetic testing is often performed in patients with retinoblastoma to determine if they have an inherited genetic predisposition, but it is not the next immediate step in the management of this patient.

Answer: B

Explanation: The next step would be to obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy. This imaging technique will provide more detailed information about the extent and nature of the iris lesion. It will help to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors, determine the depth of invasion, and guide further management options. It is a non-invasive and reliable method for assessing iris lesions.
C: Perform ECG using posterior leads.

Explanation: The presentation of a complicated myocardial infarction case with ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and reciprocal ST-segment depressions in the anterior precordial leads suggests an acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction. In this scenario, it is important to obtain additional information to evaluate the extent of the infarction and its impact on the patient's condition. Performing an ECG using posterior leads will help to assess the involvement of the posterior wall of the heart, which is not adequately represented in the standard 12-lead ECG.

By adding posterior leads (V7-9) to the standard leads, any ST-segment depressions or elevations in these leads will provide valuable information about the involvement of the posterior wall. This will help in determining the size and location of the infarction, which in turn can guide further management decisions.

Bedside echocardiography could provide information about the patient's left ventricular function and wall motion abnormalities, but it may not provide specific details about the posterior wall involvement. In this case, the patient's blood pressure is already low, so performing another coronary angiography may not be necessary at this point.

Performing an ECG with right precordial leads (V3R and V4R) may provide information about the right ventricular involvement but does not assess the posterior wall specifically. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.
D

1089
Answer: B: Teratoma

Explanation: Based on the description of the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a teratoma. Teratomas are germ cell tumors that can occur in various locations in the body, including the neck. They can have both solid and cystic components and can contain multiple tissue types, as seen in the pathological results. The presence of calcifications within the mass, as demonstrated on the CT scan, is also consistent with a teratoma.
B
1090
The correct answer is C: Cystic ameloblastoma.

Explanation:
The history of a well-differentiated squamous cyst on fine-needle aspiration, along with the imaging findings of a well-defined hypodense mass in the masticator space, suggests a diagnosis of ameloblastoma. The presence of remodeling of the left mandibular ramus, absence of the second mandibular molar, and adherence to surrounding tissues also support this diagnosis.

Lymphangioma (option A) is a benign malformation of lymphatic vessels, which presents as a multilocular cystic lesion. Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (option B) typically presents as a unilocular or multilocular radiolucent lesion, commonly associated with the posterior mandible. Cystic schwannoma (option D) is a benign tumor arising from peripheral nerve sheaths, which would typically present with neurologic symptoms. These options do not match the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Cystic ameloblastoma (option C).
B
1091
The correct answer is D: Metastatic breast adenocarcinoma.

Explanation:
The patient's history of breast adenocarcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma with metastasis suggests the possibility of metastatic disease. The findings of soft, tender nodules on the forehead and right orbit, proptosis, hypesthesia in a V1 distribution, and involvement of multiple craniofacial bones on imaging are consistent with metastasis.

The fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy established the diagnosis, showing loose billowing clusters of epithelial cells involved by strands of magenta extracellular tissue, abundant cytoplasm with coarse and fine textures, and large round nuclei with occasional conspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10, and PAX-8, which are consistent with breast adenocarcinoma.

Therefore, the diagnosis in this case is metastatic breast adenocarcinoma.
B
1092
The correct answer is C: Eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and histological analysis suggest the presence of two distinct tumor types. The singular umbilicated ulcerated papular lesion on the left temple is consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma, as indicated by the biopsy findings of vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium arising from multiple points along the epidermis. Additionally, the computed tomographic image with contrast reveals an abnormal mass in the site of the lesion.

The concurrent well-differentiated carcinoma and the observation of ductal differentiation on high power indicate the presence of an eccrine syringofibroadenoma. This diagnosis is supported by the intervening fibrovascular stroma seen in the biopsy.

Therefore, the appropriate diagnosis for this case is Eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma (option C).
C
1093
The answer is D: Epithelioid sarcoma.

Explanation: Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically affects young adults. It commonly presents as a painless subcutaneous lump or ulceration. The histopathologic features of epithelioid sarcoma include epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. In this case, the biopsy showed these characteristic features, along with areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated strong cytoplasmic staining for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin, and loss of INI-1 immunostaining. This combination of findings is consistent with the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma.
D
1094
B: Evaluate for primary adrenal insufficiency with a 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including chronic fatigue, weight loss, and hyperpigmentation, is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. A 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test can help evaluate for primary adrenal insufficiency, which is characterized by deficient cortisol production. This test involves administering synthetic ACTH (corticotropin) and measuring serum cortisol levels before and after stimulation. If the cortisol response is inadequate, it suggests primary adrenal insufficiency. The other options are less likely based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described.

1095
Choice B: Erythropoietic protoporphyria

Explanation: The patient's presentation of hand and foot swelling and painful skin eruptions in areas of sun exposure, along with a history of milder eruptions with sun exposure in the past, suggests a photosensitivity disorder. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (choice B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired synthesis of heme, resulting in the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. When exposed to sunlight, protoporphyrin IX causes skin damage, leading to painful swelling and redness. The clinical images show edema with petechial eruptions on the hands and feet, which are consistent with erythropoietic protoporphyria. The punch biopsy also reveals thickening of vessel walls with extravasation of erythrocytes and fibrin thrombus formation, further supporting this diagnosis. 

Hereditary angioedema (choice A) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of localized edema in various parts of the body, including the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. Although it can be triggered by sunlight, the absence of gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms in this case makes hereditary angioedema unlikely.

Urticarial vasculitis (choice C) is a rare condition characterized by urticarial lesions that last longer than 24 hours and are associated with small blood vessel inflammation. The clinical presentation and biopsy findings in this case do not support this diagnosis.

Acrodynia (choice D) is a condition primarily seen in children and is characterized by generalized symptoms such as irritability, pink discoloration of the hands and feet, and desquamation of the skin. The clinical presentation in this case does not align with acrodynia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is erythropoietic protoporphyria (choice B).

The correct answer is C: Multiple mucosal neuromas in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the marfanoid habitus, disproportionate limbs, enlarged face, and distinctive orolabial lesions, is consistent with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN 2b). The presence of multiple small nodules on the tongue, known as mucosal neuromas, is highly characteristic of this condition. Other findings associated with MEN 2b include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and gastrointestinal ganglioneuromatosis. Biopsy results from the tongue tissue would likely reveal histopathological findings consistent with mucosal neuromas. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (choice A) is characterized by a triad of recurrent facial paralysis, orofacial edema, and fissured tongue, which are not present in this case. Crohn disease (choice B) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that does not typically involve the oral cavity. Lipoid proteinosis (choice D) is a rare disorder that primarily affects the skin and mucous membranes, but does not typically present with marfanoid habitus or distinctive orolabial lesions.
C

1097
The answer is C: Bacillary angiomatosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of end-stage liver disease and alcoholic cirrhosis, along with the clinical presentation of multiple purple papules with central black and hemorrhagic crusts, is suggestive of bacillary angiomatosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is an infectious disease caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, which usually affects immunocompromised individuals. The skin lesions typically appear as nodules or papules with a purplish hue, often with a crusted or eroded center. The diagnosis can be confirmed by histopathologic analysis and culture of biopsy specimens. Disseminated tinea infection is unlikely in this case as the presentation does not match with the typical features of fungal skin infections. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents with violaceous plaques or nodules, which may be seen in immunocompromised patients, but the characteristic central black and hemorrhagic crusts seen in this case are not typical of Kaposi sarcoma. Leukemia cutis refers to cutaneous involvement by leukemia cells, which can present as erythematous or violaceous plaques, papules, or nodules, but it is less likely given the history of liver disease and the absence of other systemic symptoms.

1098
C: Metastatic carcinoma.

Explanation: The history of colon cancer in the patient's family and the imaging findings of an intra-axial necrotic lesion with adjacent edema suggest the possibility of metastatic carcinoma. Metastatic lesions to the brain can occur in patients with a history of cancer and can present with neurological symptoms such as slurred speech, weakness, and sensory changes. Other options, such as hemorrhagic brain infarct, nocardial brain abscess, and mixed bacterial abscess, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings provided.

1099
(Explanation) D: Obturator hernia

Explanation:

Based on the presented case, the most likely diagnosis is an obturator hernia. Obturator hernias are a rare type of hernia that occurs when a portion of the small intestine or other abdominal contents protrude through the obturator foramen, which is an opening in the pelvic bone. This type of hernia is more common in older women with a thin body habitus.

The patient in this case has a history of progressive abdominal distention and nausea, along with anorexia and crampy abdominal pain. These symptoms are consistent with small bowel obstruction, which can occur in obturator hernias due to the compression and impingement of the herniated contents on the surrounding structures.

Physical examination findings in this case include a distended abdomen and hyperactive bowel sounds, which further support the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. The patient also reports dull pain below the pelvic bone, which is a characteristic symptom of obturator hernias.

Abdominal radiography revealed segmental dilatation of the small bowel, which is a common finding in small bowel obstructions. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of a mass lesion in the right lower pelvic wall, consistent with an obturator hernia.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis in this case is D: Obturator hernia.

The answer option is:

A: Retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease)

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease) is the most likely diagnosis. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is characterized by the formation of fibrotic tissue in the retroperitoneal space, often causing compression or displacement of nearby structures, such as the ureters, causing obstructive uropathy. In this case, the mass has displaced the patient's descending colon and enveloped the left kidney without evidence of hydronephrosis. This is consistent with the typical findings seen in retroperitoneal fibrosis. Renal cell carcinoma typically presents as a renal mass without displacement of adjacent structures. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors and retroperitoneal liposarcoma can cause mass effect, but their imaging characteristics and clinical presentations are different from what is described in this case.

I would choose answer option C: Perform vitrectomy.

Explanation: The patient presents with decreased visual acuity and extensive strands and veils throughout the vitreous cavity, which can indicate the presence of a possible postoperative complication such as vitreous hemorrhage, vitreous opacities, or secondary membrane formation. Since the patient has already undergone vitrectomy in the right eye previously and had improvement in visual acuity, performing vitrectomy in the left eye can help alleviate the vitreous opacities and improve visual acuity. Additionally, the presence of mild hyperemia with foci of subconjunctival hemorrhage may be indicative of an inflammatory response, which can be addressed during the vitrectomy procedure. Therefore, performing vitrectomy would be the appropriate next step in managing this case.

C: Neuropsychological testing

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including visual field defect, difficulties with reading comprehension, memory problems, and getting lost while driving, suggest a neurological condition affecting the parieto-occipital lobes. Neuropsychological testing can help evaluate cognitive function and identify any specific deficits, which can be helpful in diagnosing the underlying cause of these symptoms. This can provide additional information to guide further investigations and potential treatment options.

B: Adjust topical medications to decrease intraocular pressure and perform visual field testing

Explanation: The patient's elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the right eye is concerning and may be contributing to his symptoms of blurry vision and headaches. Adjusting topical medications to decrease IOP is a priority in the management of glaucoma, which can cause optic nerve damage if left untreated. Visual field testing should also be performed to assess for any visual field defects. This will help determine the extent of optic nerve damage and guide further management decisions.
D

1104
B: Urgent MRI

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including ptosis, anisocoria, intermittent esotropia, and the presence of residual tumor in the right cavernous sinus raise concern for involvement of the oculomotor nerve (CNIII) and abducens nerve (CNVI). The intermittent nature of the symptoms may suggest compression of the cranial nerves by the residual tumor. An urgent MRI is necessary to evaluate the size and location of the tumor and determine if it is causing compression or impingement on the cranial nerves. This will help guide further management and treatment options. Further diagnostic tests, such as a topical apraclonidine test or carbamazepine, may be considered depending on the MRI findings. Extraocular muscle surgery would not be the next appropriate step without further imaging and evaluation.

The correct answer is B: Sweet syndrome.
Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Sweet syndrome is characterized by painful, raised, circular papulonecrotic lesions with surrounding erythema and induration. Biopsy findings typically show a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. Other findings in this patient, such as normocytic anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are also consistent with Sweet syndrome. Pyoderma gangrenosum is unlikely in this case because the lesions are not ulcerative and do not progress to necrotic ulcers. Papillary dermal edema and pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta are incorrect choices as they do not fit the clinical presentation.

C: Discontinue flecainide, start amiodarone and warfarin

Explanation: Based on the given case, the patient has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) and has previously been treated with flecainide and warfarin. However, her symptoms have continued with nonexertional chest pain, exertional dyspnea, and a decline in exercise capacity. Additionally, the electrocardiogram shows prolonged QT interval (QTc up to 594 milliseconds) which can be a potential side effect of flecainide.

Considering these factors, discontinuing flecainide is appropriate. Amiodarone can be considered as a substitute antiarrhythmic medication for AF management. Warfarin should be restarted since the patient has a history of recurrent AF and evidence of dilated atria, pulmonary veins, and abnormal diastolic filling on imaging studies. It is important to continue anticoagulation to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.

Implanting a cardioverter-defibrillator and evaluating for cardiac transplantation may be premature at this stage since the patient's symptoms can potentially be managed with appropriate medication adjustments. Proceeding with an electrophysiology study and AF ablation can be considered if medication management fails or if there are specific indications for these procedures. However, based on the available information, starting with medication adjustments (discontinuing flecainide, starting amiodarone and warfarin) is a reasonable next step.

The correct answer is A: Proliferative myositis.

Explanation: Proliferative myositis, also known as nodular fasciitis, is a benign reactive process characterized by spindle cell proliferation. It typically presents as a rapidly growing mass and can occur in various locations, including the supraclavicular region. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings, along with the imaging and biopsy results, are consistent with proliferative myositis. The benign spindle cell proliferation with a tissue-culture-like pattern and myxoid to collagenous stroma on biopsy is characteristic of proliferative myositis. Immunohistochemical stains showing positivity for actin and negativity for cytokeratin and S100 protein further support this diagnosis. Myositis ossificans is a different entity characterized by heterotopic ossification, which is not seen in this case. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a malignant tumor with distinct histopathological features, and the presentation in this case does not fit. Nodular fasciitis, also known as proliferative myositis, is a synonym and is the correct answer.
D
1108
The correct answer is C: Odontogenic myxofibroma.

Explanation: 

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic analysis suggest the diagnosis of odontogenic myxofibroma. Odontogenic myxofibroma is a benign, locally aggressive tumor that arises from the mesenchymal cells of the dental follicles or periodontal ligament. It commonly presents as a slowly enlarging unilateral facial mass, usually in the pediatric or young adult population. On imaging, it appears as an expansile radiolucent lesion with erosion or thinning of surrounding bone. It may be associated with the roots of adjacent teeth. Histologically, odontogenic myxofibroma demonstrates a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with a variable extracellular matrix ranging from loose myxoid to fibromyxoid and collagenous. There is often permeation of adjacent bone marrow spaces. Treatment typically involves surgical excision.

Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder that may lead to expansion and deformity of affected bones, but it does not typically present as a mass lesion associated with dental roots. Ameloblastic fibroma is a benign odontogenic tumor characterized by a fibrous stroma and odontogenic epithelium, but it does not usually present as an expansile lesion with erosion of bone. Giant cell granuloma is a locally aggressive lesion composed of multinucleated giant cells, but it does not typically present with the radiographic features described in this case.

The answer is C: Tularemia.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe sore throat, fevers, chills, night sweats, and neck swelling with large bilateral necrotic cervical lymph nodes is consistent with tularemia. Tularemia is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis. The high serum antibody titers in this case support the diagnosis. Other possible diagnoses such as tuberculous lymphadenitis (A), Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (B), and cat-scratch disease (D) do not match the clinical findings or serologic results.
C
1110
The correct answer is C: Sarcoidosis.

Explanation: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the respiratory tract, eyes, skin, and salivary glands. In this case, the patient presented with symptoms consistent with chronic rhinosinusitis, including nasal congestion, facial pressure, and purulent rhinorrhea, as well as ocular symptoms such as epiphora and ocular crusting. The presence of bilateral turbinate hypertrophy and nasal crusting on endoscopy, along with diffuse mucosal thickening on CT scan, is consistent with the manifestations of sarcoidosis in the upper respiratory tract. Additionally, the patient developed bilateral parotid swelling, which is a characteristic feature of sarcoidosis affecting the salivary glands. The negative results of various tests, including autoimmune workup, tuberculosis testing, and viral testing, help exclude other potential diagnoses. The biopsy findings of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation further support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
C
1111
The answer is B: Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's clinical history and imaging findings are consistent with a cystic parotid lesion. Fine-needle aspiration revealed a cystic oncocytic neoplasm, and subsequent pathological analysis confirmed a cystic, cribriform, papillary neoplastic growth with low-grade cytologic features and myoepithelial rims. This is characteristic of a low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma. Other options such as papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma, Warthin tumor, and mammary analogue secretory carcinoma can be ruled out based on the specific histopathological features mentioned in the case.
B
1112
B: Obtain serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay

Explanation: The patient's presentation of fevers, cutaneous necrosis of the ears, pleuritic chest pain, and deep venous thrombosis suggests possible systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is helpful in the evaluation of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. The lupus anticoagulant assay is specifically used to detect the presence of lupus anticoagulant antibodies, which are commonly associated with APS. These tests can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management in this patient.

The most appropriate answer is B: Her ascites is primarily due to chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart.

Explanation:
The patient has long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is known to cause chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart. This can lead to right heart failure and subsequent ascites formation. The physical examination findings of jugular venous distension, accentuated P2, and a holosystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border are consistent with right heart failure.

The diagnostic paracentesis revealed an elevated serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of ≥1.1 g/dL, indicating that the cause of the ascites is portal hypertension. The Doppler ultrasound findings of splenomegaly and an irregular liver echo pattern without lesions further support the diagnosis of cirrhosis, which can occur as a consequence of long-standing right heart failure.

The absence of any personal or family history of liver disease, as well as the absence of laboratory findings suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or abdominal malignancy, makes options A and C less likely.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's ascites is chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart, leading to right heart failure and subsequent portal hypertension.

I would recommend choosing option D: Perform a punch skin biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with fevers, lethargy, polyarticular arthralgias, and a painful rash on the extensor surfaces of his lower and upper extremities suggests a systemic inflammatory condition. Given his history of autoimmune hepatitis and recent initiation of azathioprine, it is important to consider drug-induced hypersensitivity as a possible etiology.

Performing a punch skin biopsy would allow for histopathologic examination of the skin lesions and help determine the underlying cause. From the provided information, it is not possible to definitively diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms. Additional investigations may be required to establish a diagnosis.

Checking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is not indicated based on the presented scenario, as there are no clinical features to suggest sarcoidosis, a condition commonly associated with ACE level abnormalities.

Stopping azathioprine may be considered if drug-induced hypersensitivity is suspected, but without more information, it is premature to make that decision. A skin biopsy would provide valuable information to guide further management.

Commencing corticosteroids could potentially be an appropriate treatment option if autoimmune or inflammatory etiologies are confirmed; however, initiating treatment prior to establishing a diagnosis based on biopsy results may not be the best approach. Confirming the diagnosis through a biopsy would help ensure appropriate and targeted therapy.

Therefore, given the patient's clinical presentation and history, performing a punch skin biopsy would be the most appropriate next step.

1115
Answer: B: Lynch syndrome is suspected.

Explanation: In the given case, the tumor was screened for Lynch syndrome using immunohistochemistry staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins and microsatellite instability testing. The results of these tests (Table 1) suggest the possibility of Lynch syndrome. However, further confirmation is required, such as genetic testing for specific Lynch syndrome mutations, to definitively confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, Lynch syndrome is suspected based on the test results, but it is not ruled out or confirmed at this point.

1116
Based on the provided information and the images, the most likely diagnosis is D: Secondary syphilis.

Explanation: 
Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It typically occurs a few weeks to a few months after the initial exposure to syphilis. The characteristic clinical features include a widespread rash that can present as papules, nodules, or plaques. The lesions are usually non-pruritic and can have a yellowish crust. They commonly involve the trunk, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. The rash can also be present on the face and genitals, as seen in this case. Mucosal involvement can lead to ulceration, as observed on the patient's left lower lip.

The diagnosis of secondary syphilis is confirmed through a combination of clinical findings, serology (specifically Treponemal and Non-Treponemal antibody tests), and in some cases, biopsy. The Warthin-Starry silver impregnation stain used on the biopsy specimen may demonstrate the presence of spirochetes, further supporting the diagnosis.

Treatment for syphilis involves administering appropriate antibiotics, typically with a penicillin derivative. In this case, the patient should be further evaluated and treated for syphilis to prevent the progression of the disease and potential complications.

1117
C: Granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease

Explanation: The patient's clinical history of Crohn disease, along with the presence of perianal papules and a plaque, is suggestive of a granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. The histopathology findings of a dermal perivascular and nodular infiltrate composed of aggregates of histiocytes and numerous multinucleate giant cells surrounded by mature lymphocytes further support this diagnosis. Fibroepithelial polyps and external hemorrhoids typically do not present with granulomatous inflammation. Condyloma acuminata, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), usually presents as exophytic, cauliflower-like growths rather than the cobblestone-like appearance seen in this patient.
C
cellvalue empty
1118
The correct answer is C: Cutaneous sparganosis.

Explanation: Cutaneous sparganosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of Spirometra tapeworms. It is acquired through ingestion or penetration of the skin by infected copepods or water fleas found in contaminated water sources. The serpiginous plaque on the trunk, along with the presence of eosinophilia and the history of living in a farm community with well water as the source of drinking water, are consistent with cutaneous sparganosis. The histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen demonstrating eosinophilic cuticle and calcareous bodies further supports this diagnosis. Gnathostomiasis (A) is a similar parasitic infection caused by Gnathostoma larvae, but it is typically associated with a migratory, serpiginous rash and systemic symptoms. Myiasis (B) is caused by invasion of tissue by fly larvae and typically presents as a painful, pruritic, or erythematous lesion. Strongyloidiasis (D) is caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis and does not typically present as a serpiginous plaque.
C

1119
The correct answer is A: Calcified hydatid cyst.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of upper abdominal pain, tenderness in the epigastrium, and anemia is concerning for a possible abdominal pathology. The abdominal radiography shows a rounded radio-opaque lesion with a lesion-in-lesion appearance, which is consistent with a calcified hydatid cyst, caused by the parasite Echinococcus granulosus. This cyst typically forms in the liver, but can also be found in other organs such as the lungs and abdomen. The patient's occupation as a sheep breeder and close contact with animals increases the likelihood of exposure to the parasite. Further diagnostic tests such as abdominal ultrasound or CT scan should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the cyst.
B

1120
The answer is B: Congenital splenic cyst.

Explanation: The presence of a large, well-defined cystic mass with mural calcification in the spleen is indicative of a congenital splenic cyst. The absence of symptoms, history of trauma, infection, or surgery, as well as the normal laboratory test results, further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the appearance of the cyst during laparotomy, with its eggshell-like calcification and yellowish opalescent fluid containing cholesterol-like crystals, corresponds to the characteristics of a congenital splenic cyst. Echinococcal disease, secondary splenic cyst, and splenic abscess would typically present with different clinical features and findings.

1121
D: Obtain erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of bilateral vision loss and postmenopausal bleeding, as well as the findings of optic nerve pallor and attenuated retinal vessels on examination, the most likely diagnosis is ischemic optic neuropathy. In this case, the next step would be to obtain erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level to assess for inflammation, which can help differentiate between arteritic and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy. High levels of ESR and CRP would suggest arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, which requires further evaluation and treatment, such as temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and initiate corticosteroid therapy.

1122
I would choose answer option D: Schedule transscleral or transvitreal biopsy.

Explanation: Given the presentation of a painless loss of vision in a young woman with an elevated whitish lesion in the superotemporal quadrant of the right eye, associated with subretinal fluid at the fovea, a biopsy is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the intraocular tumor. A transscleral or transvitreal biopsy allows for direct sampling of the lesion, which can then be examined by a pathologist to provide a definitive diagnosis. This is important for guiding further management and treatment options. Magnetic resonance imaging (option A) may be useful in certain cases, but a biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Referring to oncology for metastatic workups (option B) may be premature as the presentation does not suggest metastasis and requires further investigation. Starting oral prednisone therapy (option C) should only be considered after ruling out infectious or neoplastic causes through a biopsy.
C

1123
I would choose Option C: Obtain a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion.

Explanation: Given the indeterminate diagnosis and the lack of response to initial treatment, obtaining a biopsy sample of the lesion would be the next appropriate step. This would allow for further analysis and identification of the causative agent, which can help guide targeted treatment. Additional testing, such as vitreous polymerase chain reaction, can also be considered after obtaining the biopsy sample.
D
cellvalue empty
1124
C: Embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy

Explanation: Given the history and imaging findings, the most appropriate next step would be embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy. The presence of a well-demarcated, enhancing mass displacing the globe suggests the possibility of a vascular tumor, such as a hemangioma. Embolization can be done to reduce blood supply to the mass, followed by surgical removal (orbitotomy) and biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not recommended in this case as it may not provide sufficient tissue for accurate diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography is primarily used to assess blood flow within the retina and choroid and is not indicated in this case. Observation alone is not appropriate as the presence of a mass causing proptosis and visual changes warrants further evaluation and intervention.
C
cellvalue empty
1125
D: Pityriasis lichenoides.

Explanation: 
The clinical presentation of widespread red scaly patches and plaques in a 2-month-old infant is consistent with pityriasis lichenoides. Pityriasis lichenoides is a self-limiting inflammatory skin condition that typically presents with pink to brown scaly patches and plaques. It can affect various parts of the body, including the scalp, face, trunk, axillae, and inguinal creases, which matches the distribution observed in this case.

Psoriasis is less likely since it typically presents later in childhood or adolescence. Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a rare condition, usually presents with destructive bone lesions and other systemic symptoms, which are not seen in this case. Congenital syphilis is typically associated with different skin manifestations, such as vesicles, maculopapular rash, or condyloma lata, which are not described in this patient.
A
1126
Based on the information provided, the diagnosis is D: Wide-open tricuspid regurgitation.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe lower extremity edema, dyspnea on exertion, and a history of previous cardiac surgeries suggests the possibility of a cardiac-related cause. The neck examination demonstrates a regular carotid pulsation and discernible internal jugular venous pulse, which indicates that there is significant pressure in the right atrium. The hemodynamic data from left and right heart catheterization (as shown in Figure 1B) would also support this diagnosis. Wide-open tricuspid regurgitation refers to a significant backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium due to a poorly functioning tricuspid valve. This can lead to increased right atrial pressure and subsequent symptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as lower extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion.
B
cellvalue empty
1127
The correct answer is C: Amyloidosis.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of an abnormal protein called amyloid in various tissues and organs. In this case, the patient presented with a slowly enlarging left facial mass, which was found to arise from the left parapharyngeal space. The loss of fat plane between the parapharyngeal space and masticator space, inflammation of the pterygoid space, and effacement of the pharyngeal mucosa are consistent with the mass effect of the amyloid deposit.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsies were nondiagnostic, but the surgical resection of the mass allowed for further evaluation. Histopathological examination showed sections of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign-body giant cell reaction and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, which are characteristic of amyloid deposits.

To confirm the diagnosis, Congo red stain was performed, which demonstrated apple-green birefringence under polarized microscopy. This is a specific finding for amyloid deposits.

Pleomorphic adenoma (A) is a benign salivary gland tumor that typically presents as a painless, slowly growing mass, however, it does not cause loss of the fat plane or inflammation of adjacent spaces.

Paraganglioma (B) is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from extra-adrenal paraganglia. It usually presents as a slow-growing, painless mass as well. The imaging findings and histopathological features described in the case do not align with paraganglioma.

Schwannoma (D) is a benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in various locations, including the parapharyngeal space. However, the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case do not strongly suggest a schwannoma.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological features, the most appropriate diagnosis is C: Amyloidosis.
C
1128
C: Myeloid sarcoma of the larynx

Explanation: The patient's history of AML and the presence of mononuclear myeloid cells positive for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD68, and CD33 suggests a myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma, also known as chloroma or granulocytic sarcoma, is an extramedullary deposit of leukemic cells that can occur in various tissues, including the larynx. The presentation of hoarseness, throat pain, and dysphagia are consistent with a laryngeal mass. The histopathologic findings confirm the presence of neoplastic cells expressing myeloperoxidase, further supporting the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Laryngeal lymphoma and extramedullary plasmacytoma are less likely in this case based on the histopathologic findings. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma could be considered but is less likely given the patient's history of AML and the histopathologic features.
C
1129
B: Osseous choristoma

Explanation: The histopathologic examination revealed a proliferation of mature bone with overlying stratified squamous epithelium. This is consistent with an osseous choristoma, which is a benign tumor-like mass composed of mature bone in an inappropriate location. Pleomorphic adenoma is a tumor of salivary gland origin and would not present as osseous tissue. Dermoid cysts are typically lined by squamous epithelium and contain a variety of different types of tissues, including skin appendages. Pyogenic granuloma is a reactive, vascular lesion that typically presents as a friable mass. None of these diagnoses are consistent with the clinical and histopathologic findings described in the case.
B
1130
Diagnosis: A: Thornwaldt cyst

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a Thornwaldt cyst. Thornwaldt cysts, also known as nasopharyngeal bursitis or cysts, are benign cystic lesions that develop from remnants of the notochord. They are usually located in the midline of the nasopharynx, and their size can vary. The cysts can cause symptoms such as nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, and chronic throat discomfort. Imaging studies, such as CT and MRI, can help in confirming the diagnosis and characterizing the cyst. Treatment typically involves conservative management with nasal irrigations and occasionally, surgical intervention may be necessary if symptoms persist or worsen. Other options listed in the question, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, extraosseous chordoma, and meningocele, are less likely based on the clinical and imaging findings described.
C
1131
C: Refer to urology for cystoscopy to evaluate the source of hematuria.

Explanation: Hematuria (blood in the urine) can be caused by various conditions, including urinary tract infections, kidney stones, bladder or kidney infections, and even malignancies. In this case, further evaluation is needed to determine the source of hematuria. Cystoscopy, which involves visualizing the urinary tract using a thin, flexible tube, can help identify any abnormalities such as tumors or other structural causes of hematuria. Therefore, referring the patient to urology for cystoscopy is the appropriate next step.

The answer is B: Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome).

Explanation: The patient's presentation of irregular, well-demarcated dark brown macules within areas of prior blistering and scarring is consistent with the characteristic findings of Goltz syndrome, also known as focal dermal hypoplasia. This rare genetic disorder primarily affects females and is associated with a mutation in the PORCN gene. Clinical features of Goltz syndrome include mottled pigmentation, atrophic plaques, and soft tissue abnormalities such as syndactyly and pterygium. The histopathologic features of dermal hypoplasia observed on skin biopsy are supportive of the diagnosis. The other answer options (A: Epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation, C: Incontinentia pigmenti, D: Nevus lipomatosus superficialis) do not fully align with the clinical presentation and findings described in the case.
B

1133
C: Incontinentia pigmenti 

Explanation: Incontinentia pigmenti is a genetic disorder characterized by skin abnormalities that affect females more often than males. The vesicular lesions, which form whorls and swirls, are seen during the neonatal period. Over time, these lesions heal and leave behind hyperpigmented macules, which are present in a linear arrangement. This is consistent with the clinical presentation described in the case.
C
cellvalue empty
1134
B: Eruptive xanthomas

Explanation: The clinical presentation of eruptive and painless reddish-yellow papules in the axillae, along with the presence of foam cells and histiocytes on histopathological analysis, is consistent with eruptive xanthomas. Eruptive xanthomas are a cutaneous manifestation of hypertriglyceridemia, which was seen in this patient with mildly elevated triglyceride levels. The immunohistochemistry positive for CD68 antibody staining confirms the presence of histiocytic cells, further supporting the diagnosis of eruptive xanthomas. Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by velvety hyperpigmentation and thickening of the skin, usually occurring in the neck, axillae, and groin. Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare systemic disorder characterized by multiple, widespread xanthomatous lesions, which are typically not pedunculated. Axillary granular parakeratosis presents as erythematous, warty papules in the axillae, however, no granules or parakeratosis were mentioned in the description of this case.
C

1135
B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including unilateral headache, ipsilateral lacrimation, red eye, and periorbital swelling, along with the absence of ptosis or other neurological findings, are consistent with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. This is a rare condition characterized by non-specific inflammation of the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure, leading to painful ophthalmoplegia. The absence of nasal congestion, vomiting, or photophobia makes options A (cluster headache) and D (angle-closure glaucoma) less likely. There is no evidence to suggest a space-occupying lesion in the nasopharynx (option C).
The answer option is A: Right inguinal hernia.

Explanation: From the given information, the patient presents with a pain in the right groin that radiates to the leg, nausea, and a history of chronic constipation. The absence of inguinal protrusion or mass and normal physical examination findings make inguinal hernia a likely diagnosis. Furthermore, the abdominal computed tomographic scans may confirm the presence of a right inguinal hernia, providing further evidence for the diagnosis.
B
cellvalue empty
1137
The diagnosis is C: Duodenal web.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presented with a history of epigastric pain, weight loss, and nausea/vomiting, along with anemia on blood tests. The upper gastrointestinal series and computed tomography confirmed an intraluminal narrowing in the second part of the duodenum without signs of a mass. Gastroduodenoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer with pinpoint stenosis. Multiple biopsies were negative for cancer. 

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a duodenal web, which is a congenital thin membrane or band of tissue located in the lumen of the duodenum. This can cause partial or complete obstruction of the gastric outlet, leading to symptoms such as epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. The diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopy or contrast studies.

The other answer options can be ruled out based on the absence of findings consistent with them. Chronic peptic ulcers can cause fibrosis, but in this case, there are no signs of fibrosis or a mass. Duodenal carcinoma would typically present with more pronounced signs of malignancy on imaging or biopsies. Annular pancreas refers to a congenital anomaly where a band of pancreatic tissue wraps around the second part of the duodenum, causing compression, but this is not seen in the imaging or endoscopic findings in this case.

1138
I would choose answer option D: Perform Mohs micrographic surgery followed by reconstruction with flap.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and the photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen, the presence of ulceration, necrotic epithelium, and multinucleated keratinocytes with cytoplasmic inclusions suggests a possible viral etiology, specifically herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV infections commonly present with painful, ulcerative lesions and can involve the eyelid margin. The enlarged preauricular lymph node also supports the possibility of an infectious etiology.

Mohs micrographic surgery is a specialized technique used for precise and complete removal of skin cancers with high cure rates. In this case, performing Mohs surgery would allow for optimal tumor removal while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible. Given the potential infectious etiology, reconstruction with a flap may be necessary to achieve appropriate cosmetic and functional outcomes.

Although wide local excision with map biopsies could be an option, Mohs surgery is generally preferred for eyelid margin lesions to ensure complete tumor removal. Initiation of oral valacyclovir, an antiviral medication, would be more appropriate if a definitive diagnosis of HSV infection is confirmed. Cryotherapy is not typically the first-line treatment for eyelid margin lesions and may not be effective for larger ulcerated lesions such as the one described in the case.

A: Obtain a corneal culture

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), a viral infection caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. In addition to the characteristic vesicular rash, the presence of dendritic keratitis on examination raises concern for corneal involvement, which is a common and potentially sight-threatening complication of HZO. A corneal culture should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management, such as determining the sensitivity of the virus to antiviral medications.

B: Obtain aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction/culture/cytology.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of HIV infection and prior CMV retinitis, it is essential to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative agent for the atypical retinitis. Obtaining aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and cytology will help determine the presence of CMV or other infectious agents causing the retinitis. This will guide appropriate treatment and management of the patient.

B: Perform incisional biopsy of the left lacrimal gland

Explanation: The patient presented with proptosis, decreased vision, and orbital pain, which is concerning for an orbital mass. The initial MRI showed a well-defined mass in the lacrimal gland. With persistent symptoms and unchanged MRI findings, the next step would be to perform an incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland to obtain tissue for histopathological examination. This will help in establishing a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Other options, such as ordering a gallium scan, initiating antiviral therapy, or increasing the dosage of oral prednisone, are not appropriate in this case without a clear indication.

The correct answer is A: Coxsackievirus A6–associated exanthem.

Explanation: 
The presentation of a pruritic rash on the arms, neck, axillae, and face, starting as pink bumps and spreading to the neck and upper chest, is consistent with a viral exanthem. The presence of black streaks on the right arm is known as "necrotic dermatitis" and is a characteristic feature of Coxsackievirus A6 (CA6)-associated exanthem. These black streaks are often seen during the acute phase of the illness and can persist for several weeks as hyperpigmented macules.

Phototoxic dermatitis (phytophoto) can occur due to exposure to certain plants or chemicals and typically presents as a burning or stinging rash that is confined to the areas exposed to sunlight. It does not cause black streaks.

Black-spot poison ivy dermatitis refers to the black spots that can occur in a poison ivy rash as a result of secondary infection. However, the presentation described does not fit with the typical appearance of poison ivy dermatitis.

Nickel contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction that occurs due to exposure to nickel-containing objects. It typically presents as an itchy, red rash in areas of skin contact with the allergen. Nickel contact dermatitis does not cause black streaks.

Overall, the clinical presentation and the presence of black streaks point towards a diagnosis of Coxsackievirus A6–associated exanthem.

The answer option is D: FFR with adenosine should be remeasured after placing a stent in the distal lesion to better assess the proximal lesion.

Explanation: In this case, the FFR measurement was performed after inducing maximal hyperemia using adenosine, and it revealed a nadir value of 0.43 across both lesions in the ramus branch. This indicates that both lesions are causing a significant reduction in blood flow, making them ischemic. However, the slow pull-back maneuver across the distal lesion demonstrated that the proximal lesion had an FFR value of 0.82, suggesting that the proximal lesion may not be as critical as initially thought.

To better assess the severity of the proximal lesion and determine if stenting is necessary, it is recommended to first place a stent in the distal lesion. This can potentially improve blood flow and normalize FFR in the distal segment. After stenting the distal lesion, FFR should be remeasured to reassess the proximal lesion and determine if further intervention is required.

1144
The correct answer is C: Osteosarcoma.

Explanation: This case presentation describes a rapidly enlarging forehead mass in a young retinoblastoma survivor with a history of treatment for bilateral retinoblastoma and a previous diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma. The initial histologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed multinucleated giant cells and atypical stromal cells, which were initially interpreted as treatment effect and chronic sinusitis. However, subsequent examination of another biopsy specimen revealed osteoid formation with fine calcifications, severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures, and osteoid-entrapped, malignant-appearing cells, consistent with osteosarcoma. This diagnosis is further supported by the radiographic findings of an irregular mass in the frontal, maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses with surrounding sclerotic and erosive bony changes. Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that commonly arises in the long bones of adolescents and young adults, but can also occur in the head and neck region. Recurrent retinoblastoma would typically present with intraocular tumor recurrence, whereas recurrent olfactory neuroblastoma would present as nasal or sinus masses. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor, not a bone tumor.
C
1145
The answer is D: Low-grade chondrosarcoma.

Explanation: The patient presented with a deep nasal septal mass that was incidentally found on a CT scan. The mass measured 1.9 × 2.4 cm and showed internal matrix mineralization. The histological specimen confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade chondrosarcoma. Chondroma (option A) is a benign cartilaginous tumor, while chondroblastoma (option B) is a rare, benign tumor typically found in the epiphysis of long bones. Cavernous hemangioma (option C) is a benign vascular tumor that is unlikely to be seen in the nasal septum.
C
1146
D: Atypical meningioma.

Explanation: The case description mentions that the retropharyngeal mass is centered at the atlantoaxial joint and causing erosion of the upper dens, anterior arch of C1, and the basion. These findings suggest an infiltrative lesion arising from the meninges, which is consistent with an atypical meningioma. Hemangioma and vascular hamartoma are unlikely as they typically do not cause erosion of adjacent bone structures. Chordoma typically arises from the clivus or sacrum and would be an unusual location for this presentation.
B
1147
The answer is C: Metastatic disease.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with purulent ear drainage and imaging findings of middle ear, mastoid, and infralabyrinthine involvement, along with meningitis and a large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement, are highly suggestive of metastatic disease. Metastatic disease refers to the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. In this case, the primary tumor site is not mentioned but could be the source of the metastasis to the ear and cerebellum. Further evaluation and investigation would be required to determine the primary tumor site.
B
1148
The diagnosis is D: Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Explanation: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell, in various tissues of the body. LCH can affect multiple organs, including the bones, skin, and central nervous system.

In this case, the patient presented with progressive left-sided facial palsy, hearing loss, and decreased facial sensation. The imaging findings, including a well-circumscribed lesion with a fluid-fluid level and displacement of adjacent cranial nerve V, are consistent with LCH involving the petrous apex and internal auditory canal.

Surgical excision of the lesion resulted in the resolution of all cranial nerve deficits and hearing loss, further supporting the diagnosis of LCH.

Options A, B, and C are less likely because they do not typically present with the characteristic features seen in this case. Cholesterol granuloma and aneurysmal bone cysts are typically benign bone lesions, while endolymphatic sac tumors are rare tumors that present with symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus. However, none of these options explain the specific imaging findings and response to surgery seen in this case.

B: Solitary plasmacytoma of bone

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is solitary plasmacytoma of bone. The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening leg pain and impaired movement, along with the findings on radiographs and increased uptake on the bone scan, are highly suggestive of a bone lesion. The absence of metastatic disease on the CT scan and negative lymph node findings indicate a localized process. Additionally, the patient's laboratory findings, including anemia and elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), are consistent with an underlying plasma cell disorder. The CT-guided needle biopsy of the left femur would provide a definitive diagnosis. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a localized plasma cell neoplasm that may progress to multiple myeloma over time, although in some cases it may remain localized. Treatment options typically include radiation therapy and/or surgical resection.

A: Perform skin biopsy

Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with a persistent rash despite multiple treatments, including oral antifungal agents and antibiotics. The rash is accompanied by diffuse alopecia, which raises concerns for a more complex underlying pathology. To further evaluate the cause of the rash and alopecia, a skin biopsy should be performed. This will provide histopathological evidence and help guide the diagnosis and management of the condition.

A: The patient has a low-normal serum erythropoietin level. She should be tested for JAK2V16F mutation status.

Explanation: A low-normal serum erythropoietin level suggests that the body is not producing enough erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production. This can be seen in conditions such as familial polycythemia. Testing for JAK2V16F mutation status can help confirm the diagnosis. Genetic counseling is recommended because familial polycythemia is a hereditary condition.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to order urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement (Option B).

Explanation: The patient's unresponsiveness, low blood pressure, and heart rate of 36/min suggest that he may be experiencing symptomatic bradycardia, which can lead to hemodynamic instability. Urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement is indicated in this situation to correct the bradycardia and stabilize the patient's condition. This intervention takes priority over ordering an emergency coronary angiogram, as there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction in this case. Additionally, active rewarming and urgent hemodialysis are not indicated based on the information provided.
My diagnosis is B: IgG4-related skin disease.

Explanation:
IgG4-related skin disease is characterized by the formation of tumors or nodules in various organs, including the skin. It is a systemic fibro-inflammatory disorder that is characterized by infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells. This condition commonly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, and the majority of cases are reported in Japan. The clinical features include erythematous papules or plaques on the cheeks, as seen in this case, and they can recur despite treatment with topical steroids. Other organs, such as the parotid gland and lymph nodes, can also be involved, as suggested by the CT findings in this patient. Serum protein electrophoresis typically reveals polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry for IgG4 can confirm the diagnosis. In this case, the skin biopsy showed dense lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and eosinophils, and immunohistochemistry staining revealed positive staining for IgG4. Therefore, the diagnosis in this case is IgG4-related skin disease.

1154
The correct answer is C: Leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis.

Explanation: The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and relapse, along with the presence of myeloid blasts expressing specific markers, indicates a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. Leukemia cutis refers to the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin.

The tender purpuric papules and plaques with central necrosis and hemorrhagic crusting on the scalp and other areas are consistent with leukemic vasculitis. Leukemic vasculitis is a rare complication of leukemia and presents with skin lesions that are often painful and appear with necrosis and hemorrhage.

The punch biopsy specimens from the lesions and immunohistochemical assessment are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of leukemia cutis and rule out other differential diagnoses.

Options A, B, and D are not correct because disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and cutaneous mucormycosis do not fully explain the patient's clinical presentation and underlying diagnosis.
C
cellvalue empty
1155
B: Mucormycosis

Explanation: Based on the description of the lesion and the histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals. The characteristic findings include friable nodules with rolled borders and edema. Histopathology typically shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, ulceration, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The presence of neutrophils, plasma cells, histiocytic cells, and multinucleate giant cells containing refractile spore-like structures is consistent with mucormycosis.

C: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation: The patient's new symptom of severe headaches, along with the bilateral visual disturbances and hearing loss, raises concern for possible involvement of the central nervous system. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the next appropriate step to evaluate for any underlying structural abnormality, such as a cerebral infarction or other causes of ischemia or inflammation. Additionally, MRI can help rule out conditions such as acute retinal necrosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis that may present with similar ocular findings.

I would choose answer option A: Observe, because her symptoms are likely from her prior posterior vitreous detachment.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a prior posterior vitreous detachment and the absence of any findings suggestive of acute pathology, such as retinal tears or detachments, it is reasonable to initially observe the patient. Symptoms of flashes and floaters are commonly associated with posterior vitreous detachment and usually improve with time. However, close follow-up is important to monitor for any changes in symptoms or the development of new findings.

1158
A: Start systemic and topical antibiotics

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation with conjunctival hyperemia and foreign body sensation in the left eye, along with the presence of red spots on his arms and legs, the most likely diagnosis is conjunctivitis with associated skin lesions. These findings are consistent with a condition called erythema migrans, which is often caused by insect bites, such as ticks.

Given the possibility of an infectious etiology, starting systemic and topical antibiotics would be appropriate. This would help address any potential bacterial infection that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and skin lesions. Removing the foreign body with forceps or excising the affected conjunctiva would not be necessary in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest the presence of a foreign body or the need for surgical intervention. Performing a computed tomographic scan of the orbits would also not be indicated at this stage, as the patient's symptoms can be adequately managed with conservative treatment.
C

1159
I would choose option C: Biopsy lesions to rule out malignancy or premalignancy.

Explanation: The presence of bilateral conjunctival lesions with a foamy appearance and diffuse punctate keratopathy warrants further investigation to rule out malignancy or premalignancy. Performing a biopsy of the lesions will provide histopathological examination of the tissue and help establish a diagnosis. This will guide appropriate management and treatment of the patient's condition.

Based on the given information and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is A: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST).

Explanation: 
- The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting, along with a history of gastric surgery, are concerning for a possible gastric pathology.
- The epigastric tenderness could be related to the presence of a mass in the stomach.
- The unremarkable blood tests help rule out acute pancreatitis and other common causes of acute abdomen, but do not specifically point to a diagnosis.
- The contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (not provided) may have shown a gastric mass with characteristic features of a GIST, such as a well-defined soft tissue mass, heterogeneous enhancement, and possibly areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
- Gastric bezoar is typically made up of undigested material and would not present as a mass on imaging.
- Jejunogastric intussusception would typically present with symptoms of bowel obstruction, which are not described in the case.
- Gastric polyp with bleeding is another possible diagnosis; however, GIST is a more common cause of an abdominal mass and is compatible with the patient's history of gastric surgery.
C

1161
The correct answer is C: Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Explanation: The patient's elevated serum calcium level, low serum phosphate level, and bilateral obstructing calculi suggest primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is typically caused by an adenoma of the parathyroid glands, leading to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Elevated PTH levels increase calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, reabsorption from the renal tubules, and resorption from bone. This results in hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and the formation of renal calculi. The patient's symptoms of headache, facial swelling, anorexia, and malaise may also be attributed to hypercalcemia.

Hypervitaminosis D would result in elevated serum calcium and phosphate levels, but it would not explain the obstructing calculi seen on imaging. Malignant neoplasm or sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia, but they would not typically present with obstructing calculi at the ureteropelvic junctions.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is primary hyperparathyroidism.
C

1162
The correct answer is D: PTH resistance.

Explanation: PTH resistance, also known as pseudohypoparathyroidism, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by target organ unresponsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH), resulting in hypocalcemia. It is caused by mutations in the PTH receptor or downstream signaling pathways. The clinical presentation often includes symptoms of hypocalcemia, such as muscle cramps, tetany, and carpopedal spasm, which can be seen in this case. In addition, physical examination findings such as wide wrists and prominent styloid processes of the radius and ulna, as well as abnormal radiographs with widening of the physes and cupping of the metaphyses, are consistent with the skeletal abnormalities seen in PTH resistance. The elevated PTH level in this patient is also indicative of PTH resistance, as the body is producing more PTH in response to low calcium levels, but the target organs are not responding appropriately. Refractory hypocalcemia in this case despite calcium supplementation further supports the diagnosis of PTH resistance.

My diagnosis based on the given information would be: A: Acute viral pericarditis.

Explanation: 
The patient's clinical presentation, including fever, chest discomfort, and diffuse ST-segment elevation on the ECG, is consistent with acute pericarditis. Additionally, the elevated C-reactive protein level suggests an inflammatory process. The absence of murmurs or rub during chest auscultation and normal cardiac enzyme levels make acute myocardial infarction less likely. Acute aortic dissection is typically associated with severe chest pain and often presents with asymmetric blood pressure readings, which are not observed in this case. Pericardial tumor is a rare condition and less likely to present with fever and symptoms of pericarditis. The CT scan may help to confirm the diagnosis of pericarditis and rule out other possible causes.

The correct diagnosis is C: Gardner syndrome.

Explanation: Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple osteomas (such as the frontal sinus osteoma in the case), as well as other features including epidermal cysts, desmoid tumors, and colorectal polyps. This syndrome is caused by a mutation in the APC gene. The patient in the case had a positive genetic analysis for a mutation in the APC gene, confirming the diagnosis of Gardner syndrome.
C
1165
The correct answer is C: Laryngeal schwannoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of globus sensation in the throat and throat pain, along with the findings of a submucosal swelling in the right aryepiglottic fold on laryngoscopy and a soft-tissue mass causing deviation of the right aryepiglottic fold on imaging, are consistent with a supraglottic mass. Laryngeal schwannoma is a benign tumor derived from Schwann cells that can occur in the larynx. The positive S100 protein immunostain is supportive of this diagnosis. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma would typically present with different histopathologic findings, such as malignant squamous cells. Laryngeal neurofibroma and laryngeal paraganglioma are also possible, but based on the information given in the case, laryngeal schwannoma is the most likely diagnosis.
C
1166
The correct answer is C: Primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea and nonproductive cough, along with the findings on flexible laryngoscopy and videostroboscopy (vocal fold polyp and desquamation), suggest involvement of the larynx. The noncontrast CT scan revealing numerous calcified subglottic and tracheal nodules extending from the cricoid to the left mainstem bronchus is consistent with the diagnosis of primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis.

Biopsy specimens showing amorphous, eosinophilic material with calcification, metaplastic ossification, and multinucleated foreign-body giant cells further support the diagnosis. Treatment with debulking of the lesions and airway dilation provided symptomatic relief.

Endobronchial sarcoidosis (A) would typically show noncalcified granulomatous nodules without metaplastic ossification. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (B) would manifest with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis. Tracheobronchial osteochondropathia (D) is a rare condition characterized by calcified nodules in the tracheobronchial tree, but it typically does not involve the larynx.
C
1167
D: Reaction to radiotherapy

Explanation: The pustules and papules on the skin of the right breast, developing two months after the last dose of radiation, are most likely a reaction to the radiotherapy. This is a known side effect of radiotherapy, known as radiation dermatitis or radiation-induced dermatitis. It commonly presents as erythema, dryness, desquamation, and sometimes pruritus. The patient's history of a cold sore several years ago is not relevant to this presentation.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the intraoral mass associated with myelodysplastic syndrome is B: Myeloid sarcoma.

Explanation: Myeloid sarcoma, also known as chloroma or granulocytic sarcoma, is a rare extramedullary manifestation of myeloid neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It presents as a localized mass of immature myeloid cells in various tissues, including mucosal surfaces. Patients with myeloid sarcoma can have cytopenias, as seen in this case, along with symptoms such as fatigue. The fact that the mass has increased in size after the recent biopsy raises suspicion for an aggressive neoplastic process like myeloid sarcoma. Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a possibility, but typically it presents differently and does not progress rapidly in the manner described. Invasive aspergilloma (choice C) is unlikely as it usually occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Condyloma acuminatum (choice D) is caused by human papillomavirus and typically presents as genital warts, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

A: Complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. No further testing is indicated.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with early-stage Lyme disease. The annular skin lesion with central clearing is characteristic of erythema migrans, a common early manifestation of Lyme disease. Serologic testing has already been ordered and treatment with doxycycline has been prescribed based on the clinical suspicion of Lyme disease. No further testing is necessary at this time, and the patient should complete the full course of antibiotics.

D: Send parvovirus B19 serologies and polymerase chain reaction for viral DNA

Explanation: Based on the clinical history and laboratory findings, the patient's pancytopenia (decreased leukocyte count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level) along with the presence of microcytes, macrocytes, teardrop cells, and megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow biopsy suggestive of ineffective erythropoiesis, suggest a peripheral destruction of blood cells. The elevated LDH level and decreased haptoglobin also support a hematological etiology.

Parvovirus B19 infection can cause transient aplastic crisis, leading to pancytopenia, especially in patients with underlying hematological disorders or immunocompromised states. Serologies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for parvovirus B19 can help confirm or rule out this viral infection as the cause of pancytopenia in this patient.

I would choose answer option B: Obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation; monitor for multiorgan damage. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with altered mental status, acute kidney injury, and skin discoloration on the distal extremities suggests a potential systemic complication known as postprocedural blue toes syndrome. This syndrome is often associated with emboli formation due to dislodgement of atheromatous material during arterial catheterization or surgery. It is important to assess for multiorgan damage, including liver involvement, as elevated liver function tests may indicate ischemic injury. Additionally, evaluation of lipase levels can help identify potential pancreatic involvement. Ophthalmologic evaluation is necessary to assess for embolic events in the eye. Early identification and monitoring of multiorgan damage are crucial in managing this syndrome.

1172
B: Acute intermittent porphyria

Explanation: The patient's presentation of blue discoloration of the ears along with dark brown deposits on the conjunctivae suggests a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria. This rare metabolic disorder is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to the accumulation of porphyrins and their metabolites. This can result in various clinical manifestations, including skin changes (such as blue discoloration), neurologic symptoms, and abdominal pain. The patient's history of knee arthralgia and the use of NSAIDs are consistent with the musculoskeletal symptoms commonly seen in acute porphyria. No other pigmentary changes or family members affected point away from other potential diagnoses such as argyria (silver deposition) or diffuse melanosis in metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, the patient's history of dark discoloration in infancy points away from alkaptonuria, a rare genetic disorder characterized by dark urine and connective tissue pigmentation. A punch biopsy specimen from the pigmented area on the left ear would show evidence of porphyrin accumulation, further supporting the diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria.

The answer is D: Congenital cutaneous candidiasis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple pink papules and vesiculopustules on the trunk, arms, and extensor thighs, sparing the diaper area, is consistent with cutaneous candidiasis. The presence of yeast forms on potassium hydroxide staining confirms the diagnosis. The negative bacterial cultures and absence of bacterial or viral pathogens in the PCR testing support the diagnosis of a fungal infection. The pathology images of the umbilical cord section are not provided to make the diagnosis.

The correct diagnosis is C: Classic Dowling-Degos disease.

Explanation:
Dowling-Degos disease is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation and the presence of comedo-like lesions on the flexural areas. It most commonly affects the face, neck, trunk, and flexural areas of the extremities. The reticulate hyperpigmentation appears as brown macules, often in a reticulated pattern. In this case, the patient has a 20-year history of slowly progressive reticulate hyperpigmentation involving multiple sites, consistent with Dowling-Degos disease.

Histologic examination of a punch biopsy specimen reveals hyperorthokeratosis, epidermal acanthosis, elongated epidermal rete ridges with bud-like filiform projections, and suprapapillary plate thinning. There may also be focal acantholysis without dyskeratosis, as seen in this case.

Galli-Galli disease is a subtype of Dowling-Degos disease that is associated with mutations in the KRT5 gene, and it typically presents in the intertriginous areas. Grover disease is a transient acantholytic dermatosis that presents with itchy papules on the trunk. Kitamura disease is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and follicular atrophy. None of these conditions match the clinical presentation and histologic findings in this case.

B: Repeat vitreous biopsy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics

Explanation: The patient has presented with chronic recurrent pseudophakic endophthalmitis, which is characterized by the presence of inflammation and white precipitates on the intraocular lens. The initial treatment with intravitreal antibiotics improved the patient's visual acuity and decreased the inflammation, but the recurrence of anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation with mild cystoid macular edema indicates that the infection has not been fully eradicated. Therefore, a repeat vitreous biopsy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics are warranted to identify the specific causative organism and provide targeted treatment.
D
cellvalue empty
1176
B: Reposition the tube

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has presented with severe right eye pain and an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) following the repositioning of the Baerveldt drainage implant. This suggests an obstruction or malposition of the tube, leading to inadequate aqueous drainage.

Applying digital pressure over the plate may help to dislodge the obstruction temporarily, but it is not a definitive solution and the obstruction may recur. Therefore, it is not the preferred immediate next step.

Performing laser iridotomy or iridoplasty may be indicated in cases of acute angle closure glaucoma, but in this case, the patient's history indicates mixed-mechanism glaucoma with chronic angle closure. Therefore, laser treatment is not likely to alleviate the increased IOP caused by the obstruction.

Performing vitrectomy is not indicated as the primary treatment in this case, as the obstruction of the drainage implant is causing the rise in intraocular pressure.

The most appropriate next step is to reposition the tube of the Baerveldt drainage implant. This will involve manipulating the tube in order to ensure proper positioning and adequate aqueous drainage, thus lowering the intraocular pressure.

B: Refer for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation

Explanation: The retinal findings described in the case, including outer retinal hypopigmentation, clumped pigment deposits, outer retinal foveoschisis and thinning, and abnormal hyperautofluorescence, are consistent with the diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP is a genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the retina, leading to visual impairment. The presence of a ring of abnormal hyperautofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence is a characteristic feature of RP with an NR2E3 mutation.

Therefore, the next step would be to refer the patient for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation. This would help confirm the diagnosis of RP and provide important information for the management and prognosis of the patient. Intravitreous injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of angiographic macular edema or disc leakage on fluorescein angiography. Testing for antirecoverin antibodies is not warranted as the patient's history and presentation do not suggest a paraneoplastic etiology. Performing a vitreous biopsy is also not necessary as there are no indications of intraocular inflammation or infection.

A: Administer an intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent in the left eye

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings of bilateral macular edema and serous neurosensory detachment in the left eye, along with the presence of microaneurysms and dot hemorrhages throughout the posterior pole, the most appropriate next step would be to administer an intravitreous anti-VEGF agent in the left eye. This treatment can help reduce the macular edema and improve visual acuity in the affected eye. Neuroimaging of the brain and orbits, obtaining serum chemistry with radiographs of the extremities, and obtaining serum titers of viral antibodies are not indicated based on the given information.

A: Carotid artery dissection

Explanation: The imaging findings of near occlusion of the proximal left internal carotid artery and the string sign in the cerebral arteriogram are consistent with carotid artery dissection. This occurs when there is a tear in the lining of the carotid artery, leading to the formation of a blood clot that can block or narrow the artery, causing symptoms such as discoordination and paresthesia. Other causes such as carotid atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or carotid aneurysm are less likely given the imaging findings.

1180
The answer is C: Streptococcus pyogenes.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of severe exudative pharyngitis and oral candidiasis, along with laboratory findings such as low absolute neutrophil count and elevated C-reactive protein level, suggests a bacterial infection. The progression of the lesions from purple spots to firm, nontender purpuric nodules, followed by the emergence of multiple discrete ulcers involving various areas, indicates a rapidly deteriorating condition. These symptoms, along with the presence of septic shock and a decline in white blood cell count, are suggestive of a severe bacterial infection.

Among the answer options provided, Streptococcus pyogenes is the most likely pathogen causing this condition. This bacterium is commonly associated with tonsillitis and can lead to severe symptoms and complications such as septic shock. The absence of pus and the presence of multiple ulcers with an erythematous rim are consistent with Streptococcus pyogenes infection.

Options A (Herpes simplex virus), B (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and D (Neisseria meningitidis) are less likely in this case. Herpes simplex virus typically presents with vesicular lesions, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis are not commonly associated with this clinical presentation.

B: Add a second antiarrhythmic drug and reassess the need for epicardial intervention after 3 to 6 months.

Explanation: Since the patient's symptoms did not improve with the initial prescription of sotalol, it would be appropriate to try a second antiarrhythmic drug before considering further interventions. After 3 to 6 months, the patient's response to the second antiarrhythmic drug can be assessed, and if necessary, the need for epicardial intervention can be reconsidered.

The answer is A: Paget disease. 

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of gradual-onset hearing loss, tinnitus, and otalgia, along with the presence of a smooth mass behind the tympanic membrane and erosion into the otic capsule, is most consistent with Paget disease. Paget disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to weakened and enlarged bones. In the temporal bone, it can cause osteolytic lesions and involvement of structures such as the cochlea and facial nerve canal. The expansile ground-glass density lesion seen on computed tomographic scan, along with the technetium bone scan showing increased uptake in the temporal bone, further support this diagnosis. Bony sampling confirmed woven bony tissue with mild osteocyte nuclei enlargement and hyperchromasia, consistent with Paget disease.

1183
The answer is A: Angiosarcoma. 

Explanation: The patient presented with a rapidly growing vascular mass within the thyroid, which was confirmed by multiple imaging studies. The surgical specimen revealed an encapsulated, predominantly hemorrhagic, necrotic nodule without identifiable thyroid parenchyma. Histological examination showed pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, increased mitotic activity, and evidence of angiogenesis. Immunoreactivity to CD31 confirmed an endothelial origin of the lesion, indicating that it was an angiosarcoma rather than a benign hemangioma.
A
1184
The correct answer is: A) Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of worsening hoarseness over several years, along with the finding of a white sessile lesion on the vocal folds, is highly suspicious for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm of the larynx, typically associated with long-term smoking and excessive alcohol use. The gross appearance and histopathologic images shown in the figure are consistent with this diagnosis. Laryngeal actinomycosis is a rare, chronic, granulomatous infection caused by Actinomyces species and is not consistent with the findings in this case. Laryngeal candidiasis typically presents with white plaques or erythematous patches, but without a sessile lesion involving the vocal folds. Laryngeal amyloidosis would show deposits of amyloid on histopathology, which is not evident in the images provided.
The diagnosis is A: Thymoma.

Explanation:
Thymoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Thymomas are tumors that arise from the epithelial cells of the thymus gland located in the anterior mediastinum. These tumors are slow-growing and are commonly found incidentally on radiographic imaging. The presenting symptoms may vary, but commonly include symptoms related to compression of adjacent structures, such as mild orthopnea in this case. Thymomas are typically not associated with weight loss, muscle weakness, or diplopia. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for thymomas. Intraoperative dissection following median sternotomy (Figure B) is a characteristic step during the surgical removal of thymomas.

Answer: C: Radiation-induced myositis

Explanation: The patient presented with severe right shoulder pain that developed approximately 5 months after definitive lung radiotherapy. The pain was localized to the right scapula and radiated down the extensor surface of the arm, ending at the elbow. The diagnostic imaging, including CT and MRI, was obtained to evaluate the right shoulder. These findings suggest radiation-induced myositis, which is characterized by inflammation of the muscles in the radiation field. This can cause localized pain and discomfort. Metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and rib fracture would present with different symptoms and would not be consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. While polymyalgia rheumatica is another possible diagnosis, it is less likely given the patient's history of lung cancer and recent radiotherapy treatment. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is radiation-induced myositis.

The answer is C: The result is equivocal and repeat testing is needed.

Explanation: The immunohistochemistry (IHC) result for ERBB2 (HER2) is scored as 1+, which is considered equivocal. This means that the test result is not definitively positive or negative for the presence of the ERBB2 protein. To clarify the HER2 status, repeat testing is necessary. This could involve additional IHC testing or alternative methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to get a more accurate assessment of the HER2 status in this breast cancer case.

C: Obtain a skin biopsy from the upper back.

Explanation:
Given the patient's symptoms of neck pain, stiffness, periorbital edema, thickening of the skin, and limited range of motion, a skin biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the cause of his symptoms. A skin biopsy can help determine if there is any underlying dermatological condition contributing to his symptoms, such as dermatomyositis or eosinophilic fasciitis. It can also help evaluate for any underlying inflammation or fibrosis in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. This information can guide further management and treatment decisions for the patient.

The diagnosis is: C) Petrified ear.

Explanation: The patient in this case presented with bilateral auricular rigidity and immobility, along with increased rigidity of nasal cartilage. The biopsy of the left auricle showed regions of ossification and calcification, which was confirmed by the computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head showing extensive calcification in the area of the auricles. These findings are consistent with petrified ear.

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis chronicus is a painful nodule on the helix or antihelix of the ear and does not present with auricular rigidity or immobility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by recurrent inflammation and destruction of cartilage in various parts of the body, including the ears. However, it typically presents with ear pain, redness, and swelling, which were not seen in this case.

Scleroderma is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects the skin, blood vessels, and multiple organs. While it can cause fibrosis and thickening of the skin, it does not typically lead to calcification and rigidity of the auricles.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis in this case is C) Petrified ear.
The correct answer is B: Lucio phenomenon.

Explanation: Lucio phenomenon, also known as Lucio's leprosy or Lucio's phenomenon of leprosy, is a severe and rare form of lepromatous leprosy. It is primarily seen in Mexico and Central America. The clinical presentation includes necrotic and ulcerated plaques, especially on the face and extremities. The lesions are often bizarrely shaped and have a purpuric appearance. Other features include scaly plaques, ulceration, and eschar formation.

Histopathological examination typically reveals diffuse infiltration of the dermis with macrophages, lepra cells, and necrotic debris. The presence of diffuse infiltration, along with thickened nerves seen on peripheral nerve examination, supports the diagnosis of Lucio phenomenon. Additionally, the patient's history of hypoesthesia, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms are consistent with this condition.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (A) is an immune complex-mediated reaction that can occur in lepromatous leprosy, characterized by painful erythematous nodules. Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (C) and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (D) are vasculitic conditions that typically present with palpable purpura or nodules, but they do not fully explain the specific findings in this case.

The correct answer is C: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation described, including the presence of erythematous plaques and violaceous nodules on extensor surfaces, as well as the absence of other systemic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is multicentric reticulohistiocytosis.

Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare systemic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple reddish-brown papules, plaques, and nodules on the skin, predominantly affecting the extensor surfaces. The nodules can range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters and are typically non-tender and firm.

MRH is also associated with symmetric arthritis that primarily affects small joints, especially the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. However, in this case, the patient denied arthritis symptoms.

Punch biopsy of skin lesions in MRH typically shows a dense infiltrate of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells within the dermis, along with fibrosis and vasculopathy.

Erythema elevatum diutinum (option A) is a chronic form of leukocytoclastic vasculitis that typically presents as red-brown plaques and nodules on extensor surfaces. However, it is generally not associated with arthritis.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (option B) is a destructive neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by painful ulceration with undermined violaceous edges. It is not typically associated with nodular lesions or arthritis.

Sweet syndrome (option D), also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by the sudden onset of tender erythematous plaques or nodules, usually accompanied by fever and peripheral leukocytosis. Unlike MRH, it is not associated with nodules on extensor surfaces or arthritis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (C).

The correct answer is B: Carcinomatous meningitis - primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with progressive cranial neuropathies, lumbosacral radiculopathies, weight loss, and urinary incontinence is concerning for a systemic malignancy with metastasis to the central nervous system. The leptomeningeal enhancement seen on MRI and the CSF findings of lymphocytic predominance, elevated protein, and low glucose are consistent with carcinomatous meningitis. The negative CSF cytology for malignant cells does not exclude the diagnosis, as the sensitivity of CSF cytology is often low. The whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography showing extensive leptomeningeal and nerve root hypermetabolism further supports a metastatic process. Given the patient's smoking history and absence of other risk factors, the most likely primary malignancy is lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma.

Option D: Treat with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injection.

Explanation: Given the presence of exudative macular detachment, neurosensory retinal detachment, and retinal hemorrhages, along with the patient's acute vision loss and recent history of fevers, upper respiratory tract symptoms, and rash, these findings are consistent with a viral illness-related exudative macular detachment. The treatment of choice for this condition is intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection, which helps reduce vascular permeability and resolve the macular detachment. This treatment has been shown to be effective in improving vision in cases of exudative macular detachment associated with viral illnesses.

Based on the provided information, it is not mentioned that the intraocular mass is causing any symptoms or complications. The patient is asymptomatic, and the lesion was incidentally discovered during examination. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to choose option C: Observation.

Explanation: Observation would involve regular monitoring of the mass and the patient's overall ocular health. This approach is suitable in cases where there are no symptoms or signs of malignancy or complications. If there are no changes in size, symptoms, or any other concerning developments during subsequent evaluations, conservative management can be continued. However, if there are any worrisome changes, further interventions such as biopsy or brachytherapy may be considered. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is not mentioned as a necessary step in the given scenario.

1195
D: Digital subtraction angiography with embolization of carotid cavernous fistula.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the audible bruit, thrill, pulsatile proptosis, and engorged orbital veins, suggest the presence of a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). A CCF is an abnormal connection between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, which can lead to increased pressure in the orbital veins and subsequent proptosis. The enlarged superior orbital fissure seen on the CT scan is consistent with a CCF.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a diagnostic procedure that can confirm the presence and location of a CCF. It involves injecting contrast material into the blood vessels and then taking X-ray images to visualize the flow of blood. DSA can provide details about the anatomy of the fistula and the vessels involved, which is important for planning the treatment approach.

In this case, DSA with embolization of the CCF is the appropriate next step. Embolization involves using a catheter to deliver materials (such as coils or a muscle patch) to block the abnormal connection between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. This procedure aims to restore normal blood flow and relieve the symptoms associated with the CCF.

The other options, including surgical plugging of the fistula with a muscle patch, conservative management, and trabeculectomy or drainage procedure, are not the ideal choices for addressing a carotid cavernous fistula. Surgical plugging may be considered if embolization is not feasible or fails, but in this case, DSA with embolization is the recommended initial approach. Conservative management may be insufficient to alleviate the symptoms, and trabeculectomy or drainage procedures are not directly related to treating the CCF.

The correct answer is D: Acute demyelinating disorder.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute demyelinating disorder, most likely acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). The patient has a history of trisomy 21 and underwent a scrotal lipoma resection without complications. He developed symptoms postoperatively, including somnolence, paucity of speech, right-hand, and face weakness. These focal neurologic deficits, along with the appearance of new sign language attempts, suggest a focal brain lesion. The presence of fever, scrotal swelling, and pain may initially lead to concern for infection, but the neuroimaging findings confirm an underlying neurologic etiology.

The MRI of the brain (Figure 1) shows multifocal T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense lesions involving the gray and white matter, consistent with areas of demyelination. ADEM is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that typically occurs postinfection or vaccination. It is characterized by multifocal demyelination due to an autoimmune reaction directed against myelin antigens.

Options A and B are incorrect because the presentation is not consistent with opiate-induced anamnestic recall or focal seizures with postictal hemiparesis. Option C is less likely because there is no evidence of a vascular occlusion on brain imaging, and the symptoms developed acutely rather than in a stepwise manner.

The diagnosis is D: Acinic cell carcinoma. 

Explanation: Acinic cell carcinoma is a low-grade salivary neoplasm that commonly presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland, but it can also arise from minor salivary glands in the floor of the mouth. The characteristic histopathologic features include well-differentiated papillary structures with hyalinized fibrovascular cores. Immunophenotypically, acinic cell carcinomas are negative for markers such as TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin, which helps to differentiate them from other salivary neoplasms. Excision of the mass is the treatment of choice, and a level I neck dissection may be performed if there is evidence of lymph node involvement.
B
1198
The correct answer is A: Complications of otitis media.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a 5-year-old girl with a bulging, hyperemic tympanic membrane, along with a history of otitis media and recent fevers, suggests complications of otitis media. The CT scan of the temporal bones may show potential clinically significant ear abnormalities associated with otitis media, such as mastoiditis or a subperiosteal abscess. Langerhans cell histiocytosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma are less likely in this age group and would usually present with different clinical features.
A
1199
The correct diagnosis is D: Middle ear adenoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including long-standing discharge, hearing loss, and the presence of a soft-tissue mass in the mastoid and middle ear cavity, is consistent with a middle ear adenoma. Histopathological examination revealed papillary architecture with central fibrovascular cores, dilated glandular structures, and a single layer of high columnar/cuboidal epithelial cells. Additionally, immunostaining showed positivity for cytokeratin-7. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of middle ear adenoma. Endolymphatic sac tumor, choroid plexus papilloma, and papillary meningioma are less likely due to the absence of relevant clinical and histological features.
A
1200
The correct answer is B: Isolated anosmia.

Explanation: Based on the patient's history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is isolated anosmia, which is the selective loss of the sense of smell. The patient's history of minor trauma to the nose at a young age, along with the absence of major head trauma, suggests that the anosmia is not due to significant structural damage. The patient also has a history of frequent coughs and congestion, seasonal allergies, and nose congestion at night, which may contribute to her diminished sense of smell. The normal family history and the ability to detect strong odors but not subtle ones further support the diagnosis of isolated anosmia.

The physical examination findings, including a hump on the dorsum of the nose consistent with prior trauma, and the absence of masses or polyps in the nose on flexible fiber-optic examination are also consistent with isolated anosmia.

The magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the anterior skull base confirms the diagnosis, showing absent olfactory sulci and minimal tissue in the olfactory grooves. This finding indicates a lack of development of the olfactory bulbs, which are responsible for transmitting smell signals to the brain.

Cerebrospinal fluid leak (choice A) is unlikely in this case as the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of a leak, such as clear fluid dripping from the nose or headache associated with bending over.

Sarcoidosis (choice C) typically presents with multiple systemic symptoms and is associated with bilateral enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes on chest imaging, which is not mentioned in the case.

Upper respiratory infection (choice D) would not explain the chronic or long-standing nature of the patient's diminished sense of smell.
B
1201
The answer is B: Branchial cleft fistula.

Explanation: A branchial cleft fistula is a congenital anomaly that occurs due to the incomplete closure of the embryonic branchial clefts in the neck. It typically presents with a small opening in the lateral side of the neck that produces chronic discharge. The CT findings of infiltration of subcutaneous tissues and a small tract extending from the skin to the strap muscles are suggestive of a branchial cleft fistula. Fistulography and CT imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually involves surgical excision to prevent recurrent infections and drainage.
A
1202
A: Middle aortic syndrome.

Explanation: Middle aortic syndrome is a rare condition characterized by narrowing (stenosis) of the abdominal aorta, often involving the renal arteries. This results in decreased blood flow to the lower extremities, leading to symptoms such as lower extremity pain, weak femoral pulses, and absent pedal pulses. The elevated ESR in this case suggests an inflammatory process, further supporting the diagnosis of middle aortic syndrome. The MRA findings of mild stenosis of bilateral subclavian arteries and an abnormal-appearing infrarenal aorta are consistent with this diagnosis.

The correct answer is D: Spontaneous liver bleeding.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of sudden-onset back and abdominal pain, along with hypotension, suggests a significant acute event. The computed tomography imaging shows a large hepatic mass with evidence of intrahepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The active contrast extravasation from the right hepatic artery suggests arterial bleeding. Liver bleeding can occur spontaneously, especially in patients with underlying liver disease such as hepatitis C cirrhosis. In this case, the patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and the subsequent delayed liver resection support the diagnosis of spontaneous liver bleeding. It is important to note that the other answer options (A, B, and C) are not appropriate in this case as they do not explain the patient's findings of a large liver mass with acute hemorrhage.

Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of a CARD11 mutation is associated with ibrutinib resistance, therefore ibrutinib should not be used. This is an important consideration for treatment decisions in this case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
C: Order carotid ultrasound 

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has metabolic syndrome and uncontrolled hypertension. The blurry vision could be a result of hypertensive retinopathy or other vascular abnormalities. The next step would be to evaluate for carotid artery disease, which can lead to retinal changes and contribute to visual symptoms. A carotid ultrasound can help assess the degree of stenosis or occlusion in the carotid arteries and determine if this is contributing to the patient's symptoms. An MRI of the brain may be considered if there are specific indications, such as suspected intracranial pathology, but carotid ultrasound is a more appropriate initial step in this case.

Answer: A

Explanation: The elevated testosterone level is consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, which can manifest as excessive hair growth (hirsutism), acne, and male-pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). Elevated testosterone levels are often seen in women with PCOS. Other symptoms include oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, as seen in this case. However, it's important to note that the diagnosis of PCOS requires additional criteria, such as the exclusion of other causes of hyperandrogenism and the documentation of polycystic ovaries by ultrasonography, as mentioned in option D.
The answer is D: Transcellular potassium shift.

Explanation:
- The patient has risk factors for hyperkalemia, including CKD and use of medications such as lisinopril and furosemide that can increase potassium levels.
- The recent diagnosis of cellulitis and initiation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can cause transcellular potassium shifts, leading to hyperkalemia.
- The patient's neurologic examination is normal, indicating that he does not have pseudohyperkalemia, which is characterized by artifactual elevation of potassium levels due to hemolysis during blood sampling.
- Excessive potassium intake is unlikely in this case, as there is no history of significant dietary changes or potassium supplementation.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hyperkalemia is a transcellular potassium shift due to the recent initiation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for cellulitis.

The answer is B: Bullous amyloidosis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with blistering and ulcers in the groin, along with macroglossia and glossitis, suggests a diagnosis of bullous amyloidosis. Bullous pemphigoid, another blistering disorder, typically presents with tense bullae rather than the hemorrhagic flaccid bullae seen in this patient. Herpes simplex infection would typically present with grouped vesicles and is unlikely to cause the extensive involvement seen in this case. Cutaneous candidiasis does not typically present with purpura or hemorrhagic bullae. The biopsy findings of subepidermal blistering and eosinophilic amorphous bands are consistent with the diagnosis of bullous amyloidosis. Additionally, the low serum zinc levels suggest malnutrition, which is a known risk factor for developing amyloidosis.

The correct answer is C: Granulomatous cheilitis.

Explanation:
Granulomatous cheilitis, also known as Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by chronic, non-tender swelling of the lips. It is a granulomatous inflammation that predominantly affects the orofacial region. The exact cause of granulomatous cheilitis is unknown, although it is believed to have an immune-mediated component.

In this case, the patient's history of verruca vulgaris, dyshidrotic eczema, and HIV infection may contribute to the development of granulomatous cheilitis. The presence of erythematous papules at the vermillion border and edema of the lower lip, along with the histologic findings of a nodular, nonnecrotizing granulomatous dermatitis with epithelioid histiocytes and lymphocytes, support the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis.

Other answer options:
A: Oral sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can affect multiple organ systems, including the oral mucosa. However, sarcoidosis typically presents with non-caseating granulomas and involvement of other organs, which are not seen in this patient.

B: Postherpetic granulomatous reaction: Postherpetic granulomatous reactions can occur after herpes zoster infection, but the clinical presentation and histologic findings in this case are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D: Crohn's disease: Crohn's disease can cause orofacial manifestations, including lip swelling. However, the histologic findings of nonnecrotizing granulomatous dermatitis and the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms make Crohn's disease less likely in this patient.

The correct answer is D: Basal cell nevus syndrome.

Explanation: Basal cell nevus syndrome, also known as Gorlin syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts, palmar/plantar pits, and skeletal abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the PTCH gene, a tumor suppressor gene within the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. Patients with this syndrome have an increased risk of developing various malignancies, including BCC, medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's history of multiple rapidly growing skin lesions, including the nodule on her upper cutaneous lip, along with her family history of cancer, suggest the diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome.

Explanation: Mitochondrial optic neuropathies, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), can present with bilateral optic nerve pallor and central visual loss. LHON typically affects young males and can be associated with other systemic symptoms, including cardiac conduction defects and peripheral neuropathy. Testing for mitochondrial DNA mutations, specifically the common LHON mutations, is indicated in this case. Other mitochondrial disorders should also be considered based on the clinical presentation.

1212
C: Refer for rheumatologic workup

Explanation: The patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing, and symptoms of fatigue while eating suggest a possible underlying systemic inflammatory condition. Rheumatologic workup including tests for autoimmune diseases such as giant cell arteritis (GCA) should be pursued to investigate the cause of the nerve fiber layer infarcts and rule out any potential systemic disorders. A temporal artery biopsy may be considered if GCA is suspected; however, further evaluation by a rheumatologist is the priority in this case. It is also important to continue managing the patient's hypertension, but this can be addressed by referring the patient to his primary care physician. Observation and reevaluation in 2 months may delay the identification and treatment of the underlying cause of the visual symptoms.

1213
D: Perform skin biopsy for immunofluorescence.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune blistering disorder. BP typically presents with tense bullae on the skin and erosions in the oral cavity. The presence of crusted plaques on the scalp suggests secondary bacterial infection. The elevated serum creatinine level and positive urinalysis findings are concerning for renal involvement. Renal biopsy may be needed to evaluate the extent of renal disease and guide management.

Performing a skin biopsy for immunofluorescence is the next appropriate step to confirm the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and evaluate the immunofluorescence patterns. Direct immunofluorescence can reveal linear deposition of IgG along the basement membrane zone, a characteristic finding in BP.

Treatment options for bullous pemphigoid may include oral corticosteroids as the first-line therapy and immunosuppressive agents if necessary. However, further diagnostic confirmation through skin biopsy is essential to guide the choice of treatment. Oral acyclovir would not be appropriate in this case as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a herpetic infection.

The diagnosis is B: Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome, characterized by destruction or loss of intrahepatic bile ducts leading to cholestasis and jaundice. The findings on physical examination, including scleral icterus and jaundice, along with the laboratory results indicating elevated bilirubin levels are indicative of cholestasis. The presence of a fixed right supraclavicular lymph node conglomerate, extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and multiple splenic lesions seen on imaging are consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma. The liver biopsy showing a portal tract containing both hepatic artery and hepatic vein branches is also consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.

My diagnosis is: C: Gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's medical history includes a previous diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma in the left knee, and the high-resolution computed tomographic scan showed a mass in the gastric fundus with slightly enlarged lymph nodes along the lesser curvature. The positron emission tomography results also confirmed the presence of a metabolically active mass in the gastric fundus with intense uptake of a radiolabeled peptide specific for neuroendocrine tumors. These findings are consistent with gastric metastasis of the Merkel cell carcinoma.

The answer is D: Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia.

Explanation:
Based on the provided information, the incidental finding of a mass in the tail of the pancreas on computed tomography (CT) scan, in addition to the thrombosis of the splenic vein, raises suspicion for a pancreatic neoplasm. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) is a type of pancreatic cystic neoplasm that is characterized by the growth of papillary structures within the pancreatic ducts. It can involve the main pancreatic duct or its branches. The presence of a mass in the pancreas along with the absence of weight loss and normal tumor markers like cancer antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels suggests a low suspicion for malignancy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is main duct IPMN.

A: Cystadenoma: Although cystadenomas are benign cystic tumors of the pancreas, they typically do not present as large masses like the one described in the case.

B: Cystadenocarcinoma: Cystadenocarcinomas are malignant cystic tumors of the pancreas. However, the absence of weight loss and normal tumor markers makes this diagnosis less likely.

C: Hydatid cyst of the pancreas: Hydatid cysts are caused by an infection with the parasite Echinococcus granulosus. They usually present as multiloculated cysts and have a characteristic appearance on imaging, which is not described in this case.

D: Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the given information. IPMN is a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas characterized by the growth of papillary structures within the pancreatic ducts. The presence of a mass in the tail of the pancreas on CT scan supports this diagnosis.

It is important to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made through further evaluation, such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the cardiac masses in this case is C: Rhabdomyoma. Rhabdomyomas are rare benign tumors that arise from cardiac muscle cells. They typically present as multiple intramyocardial masses and can be associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The patient's history of an ovarian cyst and breast augmentation is not directly related to the cardiac masses. The other options of A: Lymphoma, B: Melanoma, and D: Metastatic carcinoma are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings described. Biopsy of the left ventricular mass was nondiagnostic, which is consistent with the difficulty in obtaining a pathological diagnosis for rhabdomyomas. Further evaluation and follow-up may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's slow rise in PSA level and enlarged prostate are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, a non-cancerous condition. The probability of prostate cancer is less than 10% in this case.
D: Further testing is needed because inferolateral ST depressions indicate obstructive coronary artery disease in the right coronary artery, the left circumflex artery, or both arteries.

Explanation: The presence of ST depressions during exercise or recovery on an exercise treadmill test can indicate myocardial ischemia, which suggests the possibility of obstructive coronary artery disease. Inferolateral ST depressions specifically suggest involvement of the right coronary artery, the left circumflex artery, or both arteries. Therefore, further testing is necessary to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries and confirm or exclude the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease.

The diagnosis for the case described is C: Ulerythema ophryogenes.

Explanation: Ulerythema ophryogenes is a rare disorder characterized by spiny follicular papules and hyperkeratotic plaques primarily affecting the forehead and eyebrows. The rough, sandpapery texture of the skin, as described in the case, is consistent with the clinical presentation of Ulerythema ophryogenes. Other findings, such as the involvement of the neck, upper chest, and forearms, are also in line with this condition.

The absence of pruritus or pain, as well as the lack of improvement with previous treatments, further support the diagnosis of Ulerythema ophryogenes.

The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimens would likely show hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, and mild inflammatory infiltrate, which are typical features of Ulerythema ophryogenes.

B: Ecthyma gangrenosum

Explanation: 
The patient's history of traveling to a region where the disease is endemic, along with the presence of ulcerated nodules with a grayish membrane, is highly suggestive of ecthyma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous infection most commonly caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although other bacteria can also be responsible. It typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions. The characteristic appearance of ulcerated nodules with a grayish membrane distinguishes it from other conditions such as cutaneous tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, and cutaneous diphtheria. However, definitive diagnosis would require histopathologic analysis and microbiologic culture, as mentioned in the case.

The correct answer is D: Hurler-Scheie syndrome.

Explanation: The presence of multiple polycyclic brown macules on the skin, coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, distinctive lumbar kyphosis, and muscular hypotonia are consistent with the diagnosis of Hurler-Scheie syndrome. Hurler-Scheie syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, leading to the accumulation of complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides) in various tissues of the body. This accumulation results in characteristic physical features, including coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and organ enlargement. The presence of dermatological findings, such as the macules described, can help in the early diagnosis of this syndrome. Dermoscopy showing nonhomogeneously distributed light brown pigment is also compatible with this diagnosis.

C: Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of rapid nystagmus in an emaciated infant with an abnormal growth pattern, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine is the most appropriate next step. This is important to evaluate for any structural abnormalities, such as a suprasellar mass, that could be causing the nystagmus and failure to thrive. The presence of a large globular suprasellar mass seen on MRI could provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Electrooculography and visual evoked potential tests may also be useful in evaluating nystagmus, but they would not provide information about underlying structural abnormalities. Blood culture may be considered if there were clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of infection, but the given information does not indicate such signs.

Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the isolated pustular nodule on the thumb is C: Orf.

Explanation: Orf, also known as contagious ecthyma, is a viral infection caused by the parapoxvirus. It is commonly seen in farm animals, particularly sheep and goats, and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated objects. The infection typically presents as a single pustule or nodule on the skin, often on the hands or fingers.

In this case, the patient's direct contact with sheep and cows on the farm increases the likelihood of encountering the orf virus. The history of a recent injury and frequent nail-biting may have provided an entry point for the virus. The erythematous, enlarging lesion with central crusting and surrounding inflammation are consistent with the clinical presentation of orf. The presence of tender lymphadenopathy is also a characteristic finding.

Herpetic whitlow, caused by the herpes simplex virus, typically presents with painful vesicles on the fingertips rather than a single pustular nodule. Cutaneous anthrax typically presents with a black eschar, which was not described in this case. Sporotrichosis usually presents as a painless, nodular, or ulcerated skin lesion that spreads along lymphatic channels, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation in this case.

The correct answer is C: True vocal fold myxoma.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings from the exams, the patient's symptoms, including dysphonia, dry cough, and the sensation of a lump in the throat, along with the videostroboscopic examination revealing a broad-based submucosal mass in the anterior two-thirds of the right true vocal fold, are consistent with a true vocal fold myxoma.

A true vocal fold polyp would typically present as a unilateral, localized mass on the vocal fold surface, which is not seen in this case. Vocal fold squamous cell carcinoma would usually present with different symptoms such as hemoptysis, neck masses, or pain, which the patient denied having. Thyroarytenoid muscle rhabdomyoma is a rare benign tumor and is not a likely diagnosis in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided is a true vocal fold myxoma.

The diagnosis is C: Nasal angioleiomyoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation, including acute epistaxis, a soft-tissue mass in the left nasal cavity, and the absence of other sinonasal symptoms or history of trauma or surgery, is suggestive of a nasal angioleiomyoma. The noncontrast paranasal sinus computed tomography showed a 1.2 × 0.8-cm soft-tissue mass opacifying the posterior aspect of the left nasal vestibule. Histopathologic examination of the tissue specimen confirmed the diagnosis of nasal angioleiomyoma. This is a rare, benign tumor that arises from smooth muscle cells and blood vessels in the nasal cavity. The patient's symptoms resolved after endoscopic excision, supporting the diagnosis.
C
1232
The correct diagnosis is C: Esthesioneuroblastoma.

Explanation: 
The presentation of hyponatremia with symptoms such as dizziness, vomiting, and headaches, along with the presence of a mass in the maxillary sinus, suggests the diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a malignant tumor that originates from the olfactory epithelium in the upper nasal cavity. It often presents with symptoms related to nasal obstruction or mass effect, such as headache, facial pain, or epistaxis. Additionally, it can cause hyponatremia due to the secretion of antidiuretic hormone or ectopic production of arginine vasopressin. The histopathological appearance of esthesioneuroblastoma typically shows small, round cells with pseudorosette formation and neurofibrillary matrix, as seen in the image provided. Immunohistochemical staining for synaptophysin is positive, indicating neuroendocrine differentiation, while staining for cytokeratin is negative, ruling out other forms of carcinoma.
C
1233
My diagnosis would be B: Lymphoma. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of painless, enlarging cervical lymphadenopathy with central necrosis on CT scans is highly suggestive of lymphoma. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, causing abnormal growth and enlargement of lymph nodes. The bilateral involvement of cervical lymph nodes, including fixed and bulky nodes in level IB and IIA, along with nontender level IV and V nodes, is consistent with lymphoma. In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma would typically present with a primary lesion in the oral cavity or pharynx and may cause regional metastasis to lymph nodes. Tuberculous lymphadenitis would require a history of tuberculosis exposure, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Papillary thyroid carcinoma would present as a thyroid nodule, not as cervical lymphadenopathy.
C
1234
The correct diagnosis is B: Aberrant internal carotid artery.

Explanation: The patient's clinical history, along with the endoscopic and imaging findings, suggest an aberrant internal carotid artery. This condition occurs when the internal carotid artery takes an abnormal course, often passing through the retropharyngeal space, leading to the presence of a submucosal pulsatile mass in the oropharynx. The three-dimensional reconstruction and T1-weighted gradient echo magnetic resonance angiography images confirm the aberrant course of the internal carotid artery in this case. Arteriovenous malformation, cavernous hemangioma, and internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.
B
1235
B: Melanoma metastasis

Explanation: The patient in the case has a history of advanced melanoma and is undergoing treatment with ipilimumab, a drug used for melanoma. The MRI of the brain reveals a lesion with contrast enhancement, which is consistent with a metastasis. The patient's symptoms, such as headaches and fatigue, can also be attributed to the metastatic melanoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is melanoma metastasis to the brain.
C

1236
C: Anal adenocarcinoma

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is anal adenocarcinoma. The patient presented with a painful anal mass, fecal incontinence, and bleeding from the rectum after defecation. The physical examination revealed a hard mass on the left side of the anus, which was ulcerated and covered by purulent exudate. The computed tomographic scan showed a hypodense mass extending to the anus, anal canal, and lower perirectal space. These findings are consistent with a malignant tumor in the anal region, and adenocarcinoma is a common subtype. The patient's risk factors, such as heavy smoking, may contribute to the development of anal adenocarcinoma.
C

1237
Answer: D: Gossypiboma

Explanation: A gossypiboma refers to a retained surgical sponge or towel within the body cavity after a surgery. In this case, the patient previously underwent a splenectomy and hepatic biopsy which might explain the presence of the hepatic mass. The mass seen on the imaging is likely a result of surgical material left behind in the liver. The absence of symptoms, normal blood tests, and the lack of other significant medical history further support this diagnosis.
D

1238
The answer is D: Order testing for anti–Mi-2 and anti–Jo-1 antibodies.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a widespread scaly eruption along with elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titer and a speckled pattern, along with elevated SS-A levels, suggests a possible diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder that can present with characteristic skin findings, such as the annular and polycyclic scaly patches seen in this patient. In addition, the elevated ANA titer and speckled pattern, along with the presence of antibodies against Mi-2 and Jo-1, are associated with dermatomyositis.

Further testing for anti–Mi-2 and anti–Jo-1 antibodies is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. In addition, these antibodies are associated with specific clinical features and prognosis in dermatomyositis. Prompt diagnosis and management are important to prevent complications and manage the patient's symptoms.

Other answer options:

A: Obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate progression of sarcoidosis - While the patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, there are no worsening respiratory symptoms reported, and the primary concern in this scenario is the widespread scaly eruption. Therefore, obtaining a chest radiograph at this point is not the most appropriate next step.

B: Discontinue pantoprazole - There is no evidence to suggest that pantoprazole is contributing to the patient's skin findings. Discontinuing the medication would not address the underlying cause of the eruption.

C: Start oral prednisone - While oral prednisone may be a treatment option for dermatomyositis, it is important to confirm the diagnosis before initiating therapy. Starting prednisone without a confirmed diagnosis could potentially lead to unnecessary treatment and side effects.

In summary, ordering testing for anti–Mi-2 and anti–Jo-1 antibodies is the most appropriate next step in this case to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.

1239
Answer: D

Explanation: The patient presented with symptoms of persistent fatigue, vision loss, and low libido, along with bitemporal visual field defects on confrontation testing. Laboratory tests revealed low serum testosterone and thyrotropin and elevated serum prolactin levels, indicating hyperprolactinemia. These findings, along with the presence of a pituitary adenoma on MRI, suggest that the patient has hyperprolactinemia due to a prolactinoma. Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas typically do not secrete prolactin, ruling out option A. Thyroid disease is not the cause of the hyperprolactinemia in this case, ruling out option B. There is no evidence to suggest that sertraline, the patient's medication for anxiety disorder, is causing the hyperprolactinemia, ruling out option C.
I would choose answer option B: Obtain a detailed procedural history.

Explanation: In this case, given the patient's recurrent painful rash in the same location, obtaining a detailed procedural history is important. This will help identify any potential triggers or underlying causes for the rash. The patient denies any trauma or topical application, so it is important to investigate other possible factors such as recent procedures or interventions that may have contributed to the rash.

1241
The correct answer is A: Calciphylaxis.

Explanation:
The presence of stellate purpura with central flaccid bullae on the ankle, along with laboratory findings of neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis, suggests calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare disorder characterized by small blood vessel calcification and subsequent ischemic necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues.

Patients with calciphylaxis typically have underlying risk factors such as end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and vascular disease. The condition often presents with painful, violaceous, non-healing skin lesions that progress to necrosis and ulceration. Punch biopsy of the affected skin reveals calcium deposition in the vessel walls, thrombosis, and ischemic changes. Transesophageal echocardiography may be performed to rule out cardiac sources of emboli.

Septic emboli (B) would present with findings consistent with infection, such as systemic signs of infection and laboratory findings of infection such as leukocytosis, but typically without the characteristic purpuric skin lesions seen in this case.

Vasculitis (C) would typically present with a more widespread distribution of skin lesions, not confined to a unilateral location, and may have associated systemic symptoms such as fevers and joint pain. Biopsy findings would show evidence of inflammation within the vessel walls, which is not seen in this case.

Necrotizing fasciitis (D) would present with severe pain, local signs of inflammation, and systemic signs of infection. Physical examination would reveal signs of necrotizing soft tissue infection, such as crepitus and skin necrosis. Biopsy findings would show necrotic soft tissue with infiltrating bacteria, which is not seen in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is calciphylaxis (A), given the clinical presentation and characteristic skin findings.
B

1242
The diagnosis is B: Erythema dyschromicum perstans.

Explanation: Erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP) is a chronic, idiopathic dermatosis characterized by persistent, asymptomatic, hyperpigmented macules and plaques with a violaceous or gray-blue hue. It primarily affects individuals of Hispanic, Asian, and Indian descent.

The characteristic clinical findings of hyperpigmented annular plaques with violaceous borders on the scalp and the superior part of the forehead, as well as violaceous papules on the hands, extensor surfaces of the arms, and the nape of the neck, are consistent with the diagnosis of EDP.

Histopathologic evaluation typically shows a superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with the absence of epidermal changes. This was demonstrated in the provided histopathologic analysis, which showed a lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction.

Discoid lupus erythematosus may present with similar cutaneous findings, but the absence of epidermal changes on histopathologic evaluation distinguishes EDP from discoid lupus erythematosus.

Lichen planus actinicus is a variant of lichen planus that is triggered by sun exposure. The clinical presentation described in the case does not fit the criteria for lichen planus actinicus.

Polymorphous light eruption is a photodermatosis characterized by a pruritic papular rash that occurs after sun exposure. It typically presents with a different clinical appearance compared to the hyperpigmented annular plaques and violaceous papules seen in this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Erythema dyschromicum perstans (B).

The diagnosis is B: Lupus erythematosus.

Explanation: The patient's presentation and clinical features, including pruritic, pink scaling plaques on the face, neck, chest, abdomen, and back, along with flaring with sun exposure, are consistent with lupus erythematosus (LE). The photodistributed pattern of the lesions is a characteristic feature of LE. Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, lymphopenia, and normocytic anemia further support the diagnosis of lupus. The negative or within normal limits results for specific autoantibodies, complement levels, and other laboratory tests do not exclude the diagnosis of lupus. A biopsy specimen was obtained to confirm the diagnosis, showing findings consistent with lupus erythematosus.

C: Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G

Explanation: Given the patient's history of HIV infection and the presence of bilateral vitritis, hyperemic optic nerves, and extensive retinal whitening, it is necessary to consider infectious causes for the patient's symptoms. Checking the laboratory results will help identify any specific pathogens that may be causing the retinitis. Adding IV penicillin G is a reasonable step, as it can cover for potential bacterial causes of retinitis, such as syphilis.
API request failed on attempt 1. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Answer: D: Vitreous tap/biopsy

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation and history of HIV infection, the bilateral uveitis, vitritis, optic nerve hyperemia, and extensive retinal whitening could be suggestive of a serious intraocular infection. Despite the initial treatment with IV acyclovir and oral prednisone, the patient's condition did not improve after 48 hours, indicating the need for further investigation. A vitreous tap/biopsy would allow for the collection of a sample from the vitreous cavity for microbiological analysis, which can help identify the causative pathogen and guide appropriate treatment. It is important to rule out infectious causes, such as bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis, to ensure the patient receives the necessary treatment for resolution of the ocular symptoms.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with bilateral anterior uveitis and retinitis, which could be indicative of a presumed infectious etiology. Given the patient's immunocompromised status and history of HIV infection, it is important to evaluate for potential infectious causes. Checking laboratory results would allow for identification of any specific pathogens that are causing the retinitis. Adding IV penicillin G would provide broad-spectrum coverage against many bacterial pathogens. Once the laboratory results are available, the treatment can be adjusted accordingly. Pursuing a vitreous tap/biopsy at this point may not be necessary since treatment should be empirical based on clinical suspicion and available laboratory results.

B: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical presentation, including vision loss, paresthesias in the left hand, and retinal findings, suggest a neurological cause for the symptoms. To further evaluate the underlying cause, obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain would be the next appropriate step. The MRI can help identify any structural abnormalities or lesions in the brain that could be responsible for the patient's symptoms. This will help guide further management and treatment options.

1246
Answer: B: Ehrlichiosis.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is ehrlichiosis. Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacteria Ehrlichia chaffeensis or Ehrlichia ewingii. Common symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, and leukopenia. The bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, shotty bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and diffuse abdominal tenderness seen in this case are consistent with ehrlichiosis. The elevated liver transaminases, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are also commonly seen in ehrlichiosis. The patient's history of living in the southeastern United States, where ehrlichiosis is endemic, further supports this diagnosis. Adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Parvovirus B19 typically do not cause the combination of symptoms and findings seen in this case.
B
cellvalue empty
1247
The diagnosis is D: Sarcomatoid carcinoma.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, a sarcomatoid carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis. The large, progressively enlarging mandibular mass with involvement of the alveolar ridge, along with areas of calcification, ossification, and necrosis seen on contrasted computed tomography, are consistent with an aggressive malignant neoplasm.

The previous biopsy demonstrating squamous mucosa with ulceration and chronic inflammation is also suggestive of a malignancy, as chronic inflammation is often seen in carcinomas. The histopathologic image of the second biopsy would confirm the presence of malignant cells.

Parosteal osteosarcoma is a type of osteosarcoma that arises from the surface of the bone, typically the cortex, which is not consistent with the imaging findings in this case.

Peripheral ossifying fibroma is a benign fibrous lesion originating from the gingiva, and it does not exhibit the aggressive behavior or imaging findings described here.

Periosteal osteosarcoma is another type of osteosarcoma that arises from the periosteum, the outer layer of the bone, but it typically presents as a sclerotic or mineralized mass, which is not consistent with the imaging findings in this case.
B
1248
B: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma

Explanation: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a salivary gland tumor that can also occur in the base of the tongue. It is characterized by the presence of both mucinous and epidermoid cells. In this case, the biopsy revealed an intermediate-grade infiltrating neoplasm with solid sheets and glandular structures, which is consistent with the histopathologic features of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The tumor cells also stained positive for CK7 and p63, and negative for CK20, p16, and S-100, which further support the diagnosis. The positive stain for mucicarmine in the glandular areas is also consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The treatment was surgical resection of the tumor along with a neck dissection, and no positive lymph nodes were found.
B
1249
The diagnosis in this case is D: Invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis.

Explanation:
This patient has pancytopenia following intense chemotherapy, making her susceptible to opportunistic infections. The rapid onset and progression of the necrotic lesion, along with the presence of ecchymoses, induration, and abscess formation, are suggestive of an invasive fungal infection. The histopathologic images from the biopsy specimens would show invasion of the gingiva by fungal hyphae, confirming the diagnosis. Treatment would involve aggressive antifungal therapy, surgical debridement, and management of the underlying immunosuppression.
D
1250
The most likely diagnosis based on the case description, CT findings, and histopathologic images is C: Ancient schwannoma.

Explanation: An ancient schwannoma is a benign neoplasm arising from Schwann cells, which are the cells that produce the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves. It is characterized by slow growth and long-standing duration, which is consistent with the patient's history of a painless swelling in the neck for 6 years. The CT scan shows a well-defined mass with cystic areas, calcifications, and heterogeneous enhancement, which are commonly seen in ancient schwannomas. The tumor displaces adjacent structures without destroying them and preserves the fat planes, suggesting a benign nature. The histopathologic images typically show a mixture of spindle cells with nuclear palisading, Antoni A and Antoni B areas, and Verocay bodies, which are consistent with a diagnosis of ancient schwannoma.

Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma (A) is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage, but it is less likely in this case due to the slow growth and benign features seen on the CT scan.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (B) is a malignant soft tissue tumor, but the well-defined, nontender nature of the swelling and preserved fat planes on the CT scan do not support this diagnosis.

Synovial sarcoma (D) is a malignant tumor that typically arises near joints, and the clinical and radiological features are not typical for this diagnosis in the carotid space.
C
1251
The diagnosis is A: Endogenous endophthalmitis.

Explanation: Endogenous endophthalmitis is an intraocular infection that occurs due to the hematogenous spread of microorganisms from a distant source. In this patient, the blurred vision, elevated intraocular pressure, and presence of hypopyon (accumulation of pus in the anterior chamber) in both eyes are indicative of endogenous endophthalmitis. The history of myelodysplastic syndrome transformation into acute myeloid leukemia, along with the patient's compromised immune system due to renal failure and recent chemotherapy, puts him at high risk for infections. The presence of small hemorrhages on the iris surface and presumed infiltration seen on slitlamp examination further support the diagnosis. Immediate treatment with intravitreal and/or systemic antibiotics is necessary in this case.

The correct answer is C: Gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct.

Explanation: In this case, the intraoperative cholangiogram revealed an unusual anatomical variant with a double lumen at the distal common bile duct (CBD), which was confirmed by transcystic choledochoscopy. This finding is consistent with gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct. The presence of multiple gallstones within a dilated region of the cystic duct further supports this diagnosis. Other options such as choledochoduodenal fistula, biloma, and choledochal cyst with long common biliopancreatic channel are less likely based on the given information.

1253
Based on the given information and the computed tomographic (CT) angiogram showing asymmetric attenuation surrounding the infrarenal aorta, the most likely diagnosis is B: Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of persistent lower abdominal and flank pain, along with weight loss, anorexia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are consistent with an inflammatory process involving the abdominal aorta. The asymmetric attenuation seen in the CT angiogram suggests the presence of an aneurysm. The lack of leukocytosis and negative blood and urine cultures make infectious etiologies less likely. In addition, the absence of intravascular instrumentation, dental procedures, or recent trauma makes mycotic aneurysm less likely. Diverticulitis is not typically associated with infrarenal aortitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.

B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathologic examination

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a growing, painful scar with recent systemic symptoms, it is important to further evaluate the nature of the lesion. A skin biopsy would provide histopathologic examination, which can help determine the underlying cause of the lesion, such as infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory processes. This information would guide further management and treatment options.
C

1255
The most appropriate answer is A: The elevated platelet count was most likely caused by a myeloproliferative disorder.

Explanation: Thrombocytosis, or an elevated platelet count, can be caused by various conditions. In this case, the patient's platelet count of 665 × 103/μL is significantly higher than the normal range, suggesting a pathological cause. Myeloproliferative disorders, such as essential thrombocythemia, are known to cause thrombocytosis. In these disorders, there is an overproduction of platelets by the bone marrow. The patient's history of severe headaches, along with the lack of response to migraine treatments, further supports the possibility of an underlying myeloproliferative disorder. Transient and stress-related causes are less likely to cause sustained thrombocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome would typically present with other abnormalities in the blood counts.
B

1256
B: Trichomycosis axillaris

Explanation:
The presented case is consistent with the clinical and microscopic findings of trichomycosis axillaris. Trichomycosis axillaris is a superficial bacterial infection that affects the hair shafts, particularly in the axillary region. It is commonly characterized by the presence of creamy yellow concretions along the hair shafts, as seen in the clinical photograph. These concretions are caused by the accumulation of bacterial colonies, primarily Corynebacterium species, and are often associated with a strong axillary odor. The diagnosis can be confirmed by direct microscopic examination, as shown in the presented photographs, which demonstrate the presence of bacteria around the hair shafts. Treatment typically involves good hygiene practices, such as regular washing with antiseptic soap, along with the use of topical antifungal creams when necessary.
B
cellvalue empty
1257
B: Urticaria pigmentosa

Explanation: The presentation of numerous discrete smooth brown papules that can be positive for the Darier sign is characteristic of urticaria pigmentosa. This condition is a type of mastocytosis, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin. The lesions typically start as small, pink or brown papules that can flatten over time. The Darier sign refers to localized erythema that develops after firm stroking of the lesion, indicating the release of histamine from the mast cells. Eruptive vellus hair cysts, eruptive syringoma, and lichen nitidus do not present with the same clinical features and are therefore not the correct diagnoses in this case.
C

1258
The correct answer is B: Argyria.

Explanation: Argyria is a condition characterized by the deposition of silver or silver compounds in the skin and mucous membranes, resulting in a gray or bluish-gray discoloration. It can occur as a side effect of prolonged silver exposure, such as from ingestion of silver salts or as a result of certain medical treatments involving silver-based compounds. In this case, the patient had a history of taking oral gold salts for rheumatoid arthritis, and it is possible that these gold salts contained silver impurities that led to the development of argyria.

The presentation of diffuse blue to slate-gray patches on the patient's face, which corresponded to areas previously treated with the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, is consistent with the diagnosis of argyria. The rechallenge with the laser on the forearm resulted in a similar macule, further supporting the diagnosis. Histopathologic evaluation of a skin biopsy specimen can confirm the presence of silver deposits in the affected tissues.

Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a common condition characterized by darkening of the skin after inflammation or injury and typically occurs after skin trauma or certain dermatological procedures. Chrysiasis is a condition characterized by the deposition of gold in the skin, usually due to excessive exposure to gold-based compounds. Tattoo pigmentation refers to the introduction of pigment into the skin for decorative purposes and is not relevant to this case.

I would recommend option C: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy.

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent meningioma and previous tumor resections, along with the presence of infarcts, microaneurysms, and areas of staining on fluorescein angiography, suggest the presence of neovascularization and macular edema. These findings indicate that the patient may be experiencing complications related to her previous treatments and underlying pathology. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, such as ranibizumab or bevacizumab, has been shown to be effective in reducing macular edema and improving visual outcomes in patients with neovascularization and macular edema. Therefore, initiating anti-VEGF therapy would be the appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

Answer: D: Refer the patient to an allergist.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms have not improved with previous treatment regimens for atopic conjunctivitis and staphylococcal blepharitis. Additionally, the presence of nontender preauricular lymph node and raised papules on the skin suggests a systemic allergic or immunologic etiology. Referring the patient to an allergist will help further evaluate and manage their condition, considering the possible underlying allergic component.

D: Obtain a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of weight loss, gait instability, vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia, along with the findings of cranial nerve palsy, pleural thickening, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary nodules, there is a suspicion for an underlying paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes can present with neurologic findings and can be associated with malignancies. To evaluate for the presence of an underlying malignancy, a whole-body FDG-PET/CT scan can be performed to identify any areas of increased metabolic activity. Additionally, a paraneoplastic antibody evaluation can be done to detect the presence of antibodies that are associated with specific malignancies. These investigations can help guide further management and treatment options.

The answer is D: Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis.

Explanation: In this case, the well-demarcated ulcers with scalloped borders on the infant's sacrum, superior to the anal verge, along with the presence of telangiectasias extending from the anus to the ulcers, are indicative of Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and erosion of the skin in the diaper area, commonly caused by irritants such as urine and stool. The presence of bright red matted telangiectasias is a characteristic finding in this condition. Other differential diagnoses such as acrodermatitis enteropathica, ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma, and candidal dermatitis can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and negative cultures for bacteria and herpes simplex virus.
B

1263
The correct answer is D: Metastatic breast carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's medical history of previously treated invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast suggests the possibility of metastatic disease. The MRI scan shows a lesion within the parotid gland with ill-defined surrounding enhancement, which is concerning for malignancy. The cytologic findings and histologic examination reveal an infiltrative lesion composed of atypical epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that the cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor, which are characteristic markers of breast carcinoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic breast carcinoma involving the parotid gland.
D
1264
The answer is C: Juvenile xanthogranuloma.

Explanation: 
The patient's presentation of a postauricular mass with rapid enlargement and histologic features of lipidized cells (xanthoma cells) is consistent with juvenile xanthogranuloma. Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a benign, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically presents in children younger than 5 years old. It commonly presents as a solitary, asymptomatic, firm, yellow-orange nodule or papule on the head, neck, or trunk. The lesion can be attached to the overlying skin but is mobile over the underlying bone. Pathologic examination typically reveals lipidized histiocytes within a background of collagen. Immunohistochemical staining for S-100 and CD1a is negative in juvenile xanthogranuloma, helping to differentiate it from other histiocytic disorders such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (which is positive for CD1a). Juvenile xanthogranuloma is typically self-limited and does not require further treatment after complete excision, as was performed in this case.
C
1265
The correct answer is C: Ameloblastic carcinoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation, including progressive painless swelling of the anterior mandible, numbness of the lower lip, and difficulty swallowing, along with the radiographic findings of grossly expansile, multilocular, low-attenuation lesion with erosion of facial and lingual cortices, are suggestive of an aggressive odontogenic tumor. Among the options provided, ameloblastic carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis. This malignant neoplasm arises from odontogenic epithelium and exhibits both ameloblastomatous and carcinoma-like features. It is characterized by invasive growth, destruction of surrounding tissues, and high metastatic potential. Further histological examination would be required for definitive diagnosis.
C
1266
The correct answer is C: Localized laryngeal amyloidosis.

Explanation:
Based on the described clinical findings and histologic characteristics, the most likely diagnosis is localized laryngeal amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid protein in various tissues and organs. Localized laryngeal amyloidosis typically presents with persistent hoarseness, globus pharyngis, or other vocal symptoms.

The yellowish floppy granular proliferation seen on examination is consistent with the deposition of eosinophilic amorphous material, which is typical of amyloid. This is confirmed by the histologic findings of eosinophilic amorphous material underlying the epithelium.

The characteristic fluorescence observed with thioflavin T staining further supports the diagnosis. Amyloid fibrils exhibit yellow-green fluorescence when bound by thioflavin T.

There is no clinical evidence of systemic involvement or plasma cell dyscrasia, which helps differentiate localized laryngeal amyloidosis from systemic amyloidosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Localized laryngeal amyloidosis.
C
1267
The answer is A: Ranula.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a ranula. A ranula is a pseudocyst that occurs in the floor of the mouth due to obstruction of the sublingual duct or ducts. It is typically painless and can present as a submental mass. On ultrasound, it appears as a well-circumscribed, isoechoic lesion, and on MRI, it shows T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, and peripheral rim enhancement. The treatment for a ranula is surgical excision, as performed in this case.
C
1268
C: Cutaneous lymphoma

Explanation: The patient's history of transformed marginal zone lymphoma, along with the presence of intensely painful lesions on the left foot, suggests that the lesions are related to the lymphoma. The physical examination findings of grouped, brown, flat-topped papules on the distal plantar foot are consistent with cutaneous lymphoma. The patient's pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level further support this diagnosis. The pruritic rash on the left thigh may also be related to the lymphoma. Shingles typically presents with a painful rash in a dermatomal distribution, which does not match the patient's clinical findings. Toxic erythema of chemotherapy would present with a more diffuse rash, rather than the localized lesions seen in this patient. Plantar warts, while a possibility in the differential diagnosis, are less likely given the patient's history of lymphoma and the characteristic appearance of the lesions.

A: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor

Explanation: The presence of a submucosal gastric mass on endoscopic ultrasonography, as well as a hypervascular and exophytic mass in the gastric antrum on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, are consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and can present with abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, and abdominal mass. The benign and reactive glandular cells and debris seen on fine-needle aspiration biopsy further support the diagnosis of a GIST. Peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer can present with similar symptoms, but the imaging findings in this case are more suggestive of a GIST. Ectopic pancreas is unlikely in this case as the symptoms and imaging findings do not align with this diagnosis.

A: Schwannoma

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is a schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are responsible for producing the myelin sheath around nerve fibers. They most commonly occur in the head and neck region, especially along peripheral nerves. The patient's presentation of a progressively enlarging cervical mass, pain, and history of a prior thyroidectomy are consistent with a schwannoma. The MRI finding of a round, partially enhancing, cystic mass near the parotid gland is also characteristic of a schwannoma. Additionally, the presence of an enlarged and distended venous structure further supports this diagnosis, as vascular engorgement is often seen in schwannomas due to their rich blood supply. Laboratory work is typically unremarkable in patients with schwannomas.

Answer option: D

Explanation: The positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test result in this case is nonspecific and may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease. While a positive ANA test can be seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it is not sufficient to diagnose SLE alone. The patient's symptoms, examination findings, and additional test results do not support a diagnosis of SLE or any other specific autoimmune condition. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate interpretation of these test results.
B: Perform a bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The patient's fatigue and elevated white blood cell count with increased immature granulocytes suggest the possibility of leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of leukemia. The bone marrow biopsy will provide information about the percentage of blasts, which is an important factor in determining the subtype of leukemia and guiding further management.

1273
B: Iododerma

Explanation:
The patient's history of taking amiodarone, a medication high in iodine content, and the elevated serum iodine level strongly suggest that the skin lesions are related to iodine exposure. Iododerma is a cutaneous eruption that occurs as a result of iodine excess or hypersensitivity. The clinical presentation typically includes erythematous papules or plaques that can be scaly and pruritic. The histopathological findings, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, show pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, spongiosis with vesiculation, intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses, focal subepidermal bulla formation, and a dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. The diagnosis of iododerma is confirmed by the temporal relationship between iodine exposure and the onset of skin lesions, as well as by clinical and histopathologic findings. Treatment involves discontinuation of iodine exposure and symptomatic management of the skin lesions.
B

1274
My diagnosis is C: Mycobacterium marinum skin infection.

Explanation: The patient's history, clinical presentation, and biopsy findings are consistent with Mycobacterium marinum infection. This bacteria typically causes cutaneous infections after exposure to contaminated water, such as fish tanks or swimming pools. The ulcerated plaque on the forearm and the tender red nodules in the antecubital fossa are characteristic of lymphocutaneous spread. The skin biopsy shows a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and tissue necrosis, which is also consistent with this infection.
A
cellvalue empty
1275
D: Talc granuloma

Explanation: Although the diagnosis cannot be definitively made without the results of the biopsy, based on the information provided, talc granuloma is the most likely diagnosis. Talc granulomas can occur as a result of the use of talc-containing products such as antiperspirants or body powders. The characteristic presentation of red-brown papules and nodules in the axillae, along with the history of using an aluminum-containing antiperspirant spray, are consistent with talc granuloma. Other possible diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, axillary acne agminata, and miliary tuberculosis, would require further evaluation and may present with additional symptoms or findings that are not mentioned in the case.

1276
B: Prescribe propranolol hydrochloride

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing lesion with ulceration and encroachment on the visual axis is concerning for an infantile hemangioma. While observation is appropriate for many hemangiomas that do not cause functional impairment, this lesion requires intervention due to the potential for vision obstruction. Propranolol hydrochloride is the preferred treatment for infantile hemangiomas that are causing functional impairment. It has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the size and vascularity of hemangiomas when started early in the course of the disease. Surgical excision (option C) and curettage (option D) are not recommended for this type of lesion due to the potential for scarring and damage to surrounding tissues.
C

1277
C: Perform fluorescein angiography

Explanation: Fluorescein angiography is a valuable diagnostic tool in cases of acute-onset vision loss and retinal abnormalities. It involves injecting a fluorescent dye into the patient's bloodstream and then taking serial photographs of the retina as the dye circulates. This allows for the evaluation of retinal blood flow and the identification of any vascular abnormalities or leakage. In this case, fluorescein angiography would provide important information about the extent and location of the retinal lesions, as well as any associated vascular changes.
C
cellvalue empty
1278
The correct answer is D: Infantile hemangioma.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is infantile hemangioma. Infantile hemangiomas are the most common vascular tumors of infancy, occurring in approximately 4-5% of infants. They typically present as focal, well-demarcated, erythematous or violaceous cutaneous lesions. The presence of a left-sided facial mass, along with the characteristic cutaneous findings of nontender, faint blue patch with subtle swelling and thick, coarse hair overlying the affected area, are consistent with the diagnosis of an infantile hemangioma.

The patient's perinatal history of macrosomia, macrocephaly, and left-sided failure on newborn hearing screen, along with the presence of a congenital hypertrichotic patch of the left scalp, are additional features associated with certain types of infantile hemangiomas. In this case, the infiltrative vascular mass involving the left parotid, skull base, and deeper facial structures, with extension into the external auditory canal and occlusion of the left internal jugular vein, further supports the diagnosis of an infantile hemangioma.

Options A, B, and C are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings described in the case. Acute parotitis or parotid abscess would typically present with symptoms of acute infection, such as fever and tenderness of the affected area, which are not described in this case. Venous malformation and plexiform neurofibroma would typically present with different clinical features and imaging findings compared to the presentation described in this case.

I cannot provide a diagnosis without more information and a thorough examination. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis in this case.
C: Lymphoma

Explanation: The diagnosis in this case is lymphoma, specifically lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland. The characteristic findings include nests of nonkeratinizing undifferentiated atypical epithelial cells intermingled with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin AE1/3 is positive in the carcinoma cells. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) is positive, which supports the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma. The presence of a nontender parotid mass, along with other symptoms such as blepharospasm, paresthesia, and unintentional weight loss, are additional clues to the diagnosis.
A
1280
Answer: C: Epidermoid cyst

Explanation: The presentation of a gradually growing mass over the helix of the auricle, associated with minimal pain and fluctuation in size, is consistent with an epidermoid cyst. Epidermoid cysts are benign, slow-growing lesions that commonly occur on the skin or subcutaneous tissues, including the auricle. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. The histopathologic findings of a cystic structure filled with amorphous material and the presence of granulomatous reaction with occasional foreign-body giant cells further support the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst. Schwannoma, hamartoma, and calcinosis cutis are less likely given the clinical history and histopathologic findings.
D
1281
The diagnosis is C: Sialolipoma.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is sialolipoma. Sialolipoma is a rare, benign tumor that consists of a mixture of mature adipose tissue and salivary gland tissue. It typically presents as a painless, slow-growing mass in the parotid gland. On imaging, sialolipomas appear as well-defined, fat-containing masses with heterogeneous enhancement. The suppression of the mass on short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequence further supports the diagnosis of sialolipoma. Surgical excision is usually curative, and the prognosis is excellent.
C
1282
Based on the provided information and the findings on computed tomography (CT) of the neck, the correct answer is: C: Eagle syndrome.

Explanation: Eagle syndrome is a condition characterized by elongation or calcification of the styloid process or calcification of the stylomandibular ligament. This can result in symptoms such as otalgia (ear pain), facial pain, swelling, and dysphagia. The symptoms may be exacerbated by eating and talking, which is consistent with the patient's history. In this case, the CT scan showed an ossified mass in the left parapharyngeal space, which is consistent with the elongated or calcified styloid process seen in Eagle syndrome. Hyoid bursitis and temporomandibular joint dysfunction are less likely to cause the described symptoms, and metastatic thyroid cancer would typically present with other symptoms such as weight loss and hoarseness, which the patient did not have.
C
1283
The correct answer is D: Pulmonary tumor embolism.

Explanation: The CT scan of the chest in this patient shows a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery, which is consistent with an embolism. However, the patient's lack of clinical improvement after catheter-directed embolectomy and thrombolysis raises suspicion for an alternative diagnosis. In this case, the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules on the CT scan suggests the possibility of tumor embolism, where malignant cells from a primary tumor have traveled through the bloodstream and lodged in the pulmonary vasculature. Other differential diagnoses, such as venous thromboembolic disease, pulmonary artery sarcoma, or locally advanced lung cancer, are less likely given the clinical and radiographic findings.
B
cellvalue empty
1284
D: The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 protein expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution.

Explanation: The patient's cytogenetic tests showed a complex karyotype with del(17)(p13.1) in 35% of her cells, indicating an unfavorable cytogenetic feature. Additionally, the patient's unmutated IgHV gene status, with a somatic mutation rate of 0%, suggests a higher risk of disease progression and a lower likelihood of responding to chemoimmunotherapy. This is further supported by the presence of clonal evolution, which refers to the genetic changes that occur in CLL cells over time. Positive ZAP-70 protein expression and promoter unmethylated status are also associated with poor prognosis in CLL.
D

1285
The correct answer is C: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss, along with the findings of a duodenal mass, are suggestive of a possible ampullary tumor. The computed tomographic scan shows a solid mass involving the ampulla of Vater and the head of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a type of tumor that arises from the pancreatic ducts and can involve the ampulla of Vater. IPMN is often associated with mucin production, which may explain the patient's diarrhea.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm (A) and serous cystadenoma (D) are pancreatic cystic neoplasms and are unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Primary duodenal carcinoid tumor (B) is a rare type of tumor that usually presents with abdominal pain, but not with diarrhea and weight loss. The absence of jaundice and the presence of a mass involving the ampulla of Vater make duodenal carcinoid less likely.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and the patient's medical history, the most likely diagnosis is intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (C).
C
cellvalue empty
1286
B: Subclavian pseudoaneurysm 

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with a subclavian pseudoaneurysm. The coolness and cyanosis of the right arm, absent radial and brachial pulses, and pulsatile mass in the upper chest wall are suggestive of compromised arterial flow in the subclavian artery. This is likely secondary to a pseudoaneurysm, which is a collection of blood that forms outside the artery but remains in communication with it. The patient's history of laryngectomy with radiation and neck dissection, as well as carotid artery ligation, increases the risk for vascular complications. The selective angiogram of the innominate artery would help further evaluate and confirm the diagnosis. Carotid stump syndrome, innominate artery pseudoaneurysm, and Kommerell diverticulum are less likely given the patient's specific presentation and history.
C

1287
I would choose option D: Biopsy the skin lesions.

Explanation: The patient has developed a fever and a macular rash, which could indicate an underlying systemic condition. Biopsy of the skin lesions can provide further diagnostic information to help identify the cause of the rash. This is important because the patient already has multiple abnormal liver function test results and a positive antinuclear antibody test, suggesting the presence of autoimmune hepatitis. However, other conditions, such as drug-induced liver injury or a co-existing infection, need to be ruled out. The skin biopsy can help determine if the rash is related to the underlying autoimmune hepatitis or if it is a separate issue that requires further investigation.

1288
The correct answer option is B: Obtain a bilateral lower limb veins compression ultrasonography.

Explanation: In this case, the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE) such as shortness of breath on exertion and pleuritic chest pain. Additionally, the patient has multiple risk factors for PE including obesity, past tobacco use, and dyslipidemia. However, the pretest clinical probability of PE is likely but not definitive according to the 2-level Wells score. Since D-dimer measurement was not performed, an alternative diagnostic test should be considered.

Bilateral lower limb veins compression ultrasonography is the next appropriate step to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common precursor to PE. This is because most PE cases result from thromboembolism originating in the lower extremities. Performing a lower limb veins ultrasound can help identify the presence of DVT, which would support the diagnosis of PE.

Obtaining a lung ventilation-perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scan or pulmonary angiogram (option C) may be considered if the ultrasound is inconclusive or not available. However, performing an ultrasound is less invasive and more readily available, making it the preferred initial step.

Testing for D-dimer (option D) was not performed in this case due to the high pretest probability of PE according to the Wells score. Therefore, D-dimer testing is not needed at this stage.

1289
B: Secondary syphilis

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with secondary syphilis. The erythematous papules and vesicles on the palms and soles, as well as the oral lesions, are classic features of secondary syphilis. The biopsy specimen shows a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with plasma cells, consistent with syphilis. The elevated coxsackievirus titer is not related to the patient's current presentation. Rocky Mountain spotted fever typically presents with fever and a petechial rash, which are not described in this case. Hand, foot, and mouth disease typically presents with vesicular lesions on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa, but lacks systemic symptoms like myalgias and fatigue. Primary human immunodeficiency virus infection may present with a flu-like illness, but the skin findings and oral lesions described are not typical for HIV infection.

1290
The correct answer is D: Cutaneous mucormycosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of a nonhealing ulcer following trauma, along with the presence of an eschar, raises concern for an opportunistic infection in the setting of immunosuppression. The histopathologic images reveal necrotic debris and fat necrosis with saponification, as well as numerous nonseptate, thick-walled fungal hyphae in the dermis. These findings are consistent with cutaneous mucormycosis, a fungal infection caused by fungi in the Mucorales order. Risk factors for mucormycosis include immunocompromised states, such as diabetes and post-transplantation immunosuppression. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial in these cases, as mucormycosis can rapidly progress and has a high mortality rate.

B: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis)

Explanation: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a rare autoimmune disease that primarily affects the blood vessels of the respiratory tract and kidneys. However, it can also affect other organs, including the ears. The clinical presentation of erythematous ears associated with a burning sensation, worsened by exposure to cold and damp environments, is consistent with the systemic vasculitic involvement seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The presence of papular lesions with purpura and hemorrhagic crust, as well as the histologic findings of thrombi within blood vessels, further support this diagnosis. Direct immunofluorescence examination also reveals thrombi within vessels, confirming the vascular inflammation seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

C: Perform an eyelid nodule biopsy

Explanation: Performing an eyelid nodule biopsy is the next step to further investigate the cause of the bilateral eyelid nodules. The comprehensive evaluation of the older brother earlier in his life, including skin biopsies, did not reveal any significant findings at that time. Therefore, another biopsy may provide valuable information and help in establishing a diagnosis for both siblings.

A: Perform a serum test for autoantibodies

Explanation: The patient's diplopia is likely a result of a neurological condition rather than an ongoing sinus infection. Since there is no improvement with sinusitis treatment and no infectious involvement found in the scans, the next step would be to investigate for autoimmune causes. A serum test for autoantibodies can help identify any underlying autoimmune conditions that may be causing the diplopia.

The diagnosis is C: Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent episodes of right-sided ptosis, severe headache preceding the development of ptosis, and double vision is consistent with recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy. This condition typically occurs in children and is characterized by recurrent episodes of unilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, often accompanied by headache. It is thought to be a variant of migraine and is believed to be caused by inflammation of the oculomotor nerve. The thickening of the cisternal part of the right third cranial nerve seen on brain magnetic resonance imaging supports this diagnosis. Recurrent meningitis, posterior communicating artery aneurysm, and myasthenia are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

1295
Based on the information provided, the diagnosis is C: Melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx.

Explanation: The histopathologic images and description suggest the presence of oncocytic cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm containing scattered brown pigments. Melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia is a benign condition characterized by the presence of pigmented oncocytic cells, which can resemble melanoma. The brown pigment seen in this case is negative for iron stain, HMB45 stain (a marker for melanoma), and positive for Fontana Masson stain (a marker for melanin). The absence of invasion into surrounding structures, low proliferative index, and lack of dyskeratosis further support the diagnosis of melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia rather than malignant melanoma.
C
1296
The answer is C: Myositis ossificans traumatica.

Explanation: Myositis ossificans traumatica is a condition characterized by the formation of heterotopic bone within the muscles or soft tissues, typically as a result of trauma or injury. In this case, the patient developed trismus following treatment of a dental abscess, suggesting that trauma to the muscles or soft tissues may have occurred during the treatment. The CT images show dense calcifications within the muscles of the face, which is consistent with myositis ossificans traumatica. Lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and tumoral calcinosis would not typically present with the same CT findings or be associated with trismus following dental treatment.
C
1297
The correct answer is C: Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including nasal drainage, severe headaches, and long-standing visual loss, along with the physical examination findings of severe left proptosis, telecanthus, purulent nasal drainage, and extensive nasal polyps filling the bilateral nasal cavities, are consistent with chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. The computed tomographic imaging showing extensive nasal polyposis, bony remodeling, and massive erosion of the skull base and orbits further support this diagnosis.

Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (A) typically presents with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis, but without the extensive erosion seen in this case. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (B) is a malignant tumor that can present with similar symptoms, but it would typically appear as a mass rather than diffuse nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis (D) may present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, but the extent of erosion seen in this case is more indicative of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.
C
1298
The correct answer is B: Radiation-induced liposarcoma.

Explanation: The patient has a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma and postoperative radiation therapy, which puts her at risk for radiation-induced secondary malignancies. The imaging findings show a well-defined enhancing mass in the floor of the mouth, which is consistent with a tumor. The surgical specimen reveals a tumor composed of a homogeneous, whitish, rubbery, and glistening content, which is characteristic of liposarcoma. The microscopic examination confirms the diagnosis, showing oval to eel-like spindle nuclei distributed in a background of generally wavy collagenous fibers and mucinous matrix. The specimen is immunoreactive for S-100, which is commonly expressed in liposarcomas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is radiation-induced liposarcoma.
C
1299
The answer is B: Angioedema.

Explanation:
The patient's history of skin lesions compatible with sarcoidosis and the biopsy findings suggest a possible underlying sarcoidosis. However, in this case, the acute onset of symptoms, along with the rapid progression, difficulty in breathing, muffled and hoarse voice, and visual findings of diffuse swelling of the supraglottic structures on laryngoscopy and CT scan, are more consistent with angioedema. Angioedema is a localized swelling caused by the rapid accumulation of fluid in the deep dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin or mucosa. In this case, the angioedema involves the supraglottic structures, leading to airway compromise and the need for intubation. The pale appearance of the mucosa on laryngoscopy is characteristic of angioedema. Treatment with intravenous steroids and airway management are appropriate for angioedema. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma typically manifests as a slow-growing mass with chronic symptoms, whereas laryngeal tuberculosis would present with constitutional symptoms and persistent hoarseness, and sarcoidosis typically presents with systemic symptoms rather than acute airway compromise.
D

B: Refer for ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of cancer, the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, and the red and swollen eyelid, it is important to rule out any potential malignancy or metastasis. An ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography would provide more information about the underlying cause of the symptoms.

The correct answer is B: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a young woman with incidentally discovered intraperitoneal masses suggests the possibility of a primary intra-abdominal tumor. Among the answer options, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most likely diagnosis given the location of the masses adjacent to the liver, pancreas, and stomach. GISTs typically arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are pacemaker cells found in the gastrointestinal tract. These tumors can occur anywhere in the GI tract, but they are most commonly found in the stomach and small intestine. The presentation can vary depending on the location and size of the tumor, but they can be incidentally discovered on imaging studies or may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or obstruction. The definitive diagnosis of GIST is made through histologic examination and immunohistochemical staining, typically showing CD117 (KIT) positivity. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for localized GISTs, although adjuvant therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be considered for high-risk tumors or metastatic disease.

A: Pelvic teratoma

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a pelvic teratoma. Pelvic teratomas are germ cell tumors that contain tissues derived from three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). They are typically cystic masses and can contain various types of tissues including hair, teeth, and bone. The presence of irregularly shaped ossifications within the cystic pelvic mass seen on computed tomography supports the diagnosis of a teratoma. Other options such as Meckel diverticulum, enteric duplication cyst, and carcinoid tumor are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

C: Order a complete blood cell count with differential to rule out a hematologic disorder.

Explanation: Recurrent oral ulcers can have various etiologies, including infectious, autoimmune, hematologic, and neoplastic causes. In this case, as the oral ulcers have been recurring for the past 2 years and the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and anxiety, it is important to rule out a hematologic disorder. A complete blood cell count with differential can help identify any abnormalities in the blood cells, such as neutropenia or eosinophilia, which may indicate an underlying hematologic disorder. Once these results are obtained, further investigations or referrals can be made as necessary.

1304
B: Obstructive abnormality with pseudorestriction

Explanation: The pulmonary function test results show a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), indicating airflow limitation and obstruction. However, the ratio of FEV1 to FVC is within normal limits, which suggests the presence of a restrictive abnormality. This combination of findings is consistent with pseudorestriction, which occurs when a patient with underlying obstructive lung disease develops superimposed restrictive lung disease. In this case, the patient's smoking history and physical examination findings also support the presence of an obstructive component.

Answer: C: Refer to surgery for removal of the thymus.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including weight loss, tremor, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and thyroid function test results (low TSH, high free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels), are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland further supports this diagnosis.

The 18F-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan reveals increased metabolic activity in the thymus, indicating thymic hyperplasia. In adult patients, thymic hyperplasia is often associated with autoimmune disorders, including Graves' disease, which is a common cause of hyperthyroidism.

Given the patient's symptoms and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient to surgery for the removal of the thymus. Thymectomy has been shown to be an effective treatment for thymic hyperplasia associated with Graves' disease.

A biopsy of the thymus may be considered if there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis or if malignancy is suspected. However, thymectomy is often performed as an initial treatment in cases of thymic hyperplasia associated with autoimmune disorders.

Referring to medical oncology is not necessary at this point, as there is no indication of malignancy based on the imaging findings and clinical presentation.

Repeating the CT scan in 3 to 6 months without any intervention would not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and the presence of thymic hyperplasia. Prompt treatment with thymectomy is warranted in this case.

C: Refer to surgery for removal of the thymus 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, along with the enlarged thymus and increased metabolic activity seen on the FDG-PET/CT scan, suggest a diagnosis of Graves' disease (hyperthyroidism) with thymic hyperplasia. Thymectomy is recommended in cases of thymic hyperplasia associated with Graves' disease to alleviate symptoms and prevent recurrence. Therefore, referral to surgery for removal of the thymus would be the appropriate next step in management.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Answer: C: Refer to surgery for removal of the thymus

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with a diagnosis of Graves' disease. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes overactivity of the thyroid gland, resulting in hyperthyroidism. The presence of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, low TSH levels, elevated free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels, and a positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin index confirm the diagnosis.

The FDG-PET/CT scan also revealed increased metabolic activity in the thymus, indicating thymic hyperplasia. Thymic hyperplasia can occur as a result of Graves' disease and is usually reversible after the treatment of hyperthyroidism. However, in some cases, thymic hyperplasia can progress to thymoma, a rare tumor of the thymus gland.

Given the patient's significant symptoms, weight loss, and enlarged thymus, it is prudent to refer her to surgery for the removal of the thymus. This will not only alleviate her symptoms but also evaluate the thymus for any underlying malignancy (thymoma). A biopsy may also be performed during the surgery to confirm the diagnosis. This course of action is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate management of the patient's condition.

My diagnosis is B: Infantile myofibromatosis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation, including the firm, exophytic nodule with occasional erosions and crusting, is consistent with infantile myofibromatosis. The histopathologic image of the biopsy specimen reveals spindle-shaped cells forming fascicles, consistent with this diagnosis. Immunohistochemical staining shows positive staining for muscle-specific actin, further supporting the diagnosis. Infantile myofibromatosis is a benign fibrous tumor that typically presents in infancy and can spontaneously regress without treatment, as observed in this case.

The correct answer is A: Ecthyma gangrenosum.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a rapidly enlarging ulcer with raised border, surrounding erythema, and a base with purulent debris is consistent with ecthyma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous manifestation typically associated with systemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, especially in immunocompromised patients.

Histopathologic evaluation of a biopsy specimen from the edge of the ulcer may show enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, as well as cytoplasmic inclusions in some macrophages. These findings are indicative of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Cytomegalovirus ulcer and mucormycosis ulcer are less likely in this case since the clinical presentation and the biopsy findings are not consistent with these conditions.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is also a differential diagnosis for the clinical presentation but is not associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, pyoderma gangrenosum does not typically present with intranuclear inclusions or cytoplasmic inclusions on histopathologic evaluation. Therefore, ecthyma gangrenosum (option A) is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

The answer is C: Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with purpuric lesions on acral sites, along with hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury, suggests an underlying systemic process. The histopathologic findings of multifocal intravascular fibrinoid material consisting of a mix of cryoglobulins and fibrin thrombi with relatively little vessel wall inflammation further support the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. Type I cryoglobulinemia is associated with monoclonal gammopathies, such as multiple myeloma. This patient's history of chronic kidney disease and nonischemic cardiomyopathy may be related to the underlying multiple myeloma.

D: Treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy.

Explanation: Given that the patient has Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) with active bone marrow involvement, it is important to address the underlying systemic condition with systemic chemotherapy. Additionally, due to the presence of bilateral choroidal detachment, pars plana vitrectomy would be necessary to manage the vitreous hemorrhage and improve the view of the posterior pole. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to treat the patient with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy.

Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be D: Antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF).

Explanation:
The patient presented with serous retinal detachment involving the macula and extending from the 2-o'clock to the 10-o'clock position, along with pigmentary and atrophic changes in the macula. Fluorescein angiography showed multifocal areas of early hyperfluorescence with late leakage and diffuse retinal vascular leakage predominantly in the inferior retina. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed subretinal fluid throughout the macula and an enlarged choroid throughout the posterior pole.

This presentation suggests the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which can cause serous retinal detachment and fluid accumulation in the macula. Anti-VEGF therapy is the standard treatment for CNV, as it inhibits the abnormal blood vessel growth and reduces fluid leakage. Photodynamic therapy is an older treatment option and is less commonly used now. Systemic corticosteroid therapy is unlikely to be effective in this case, as the underlying cause is likely CNV rather than inflammation.

Therefore, D: Antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF) would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

Based on the information provided, the diagnosis is:

B: Lymphatic malformation

Explanation: The massive retroperitoneal cystic mass causing displacement of abdominal organs and moderate hydronephrosis is most consistent with a lymphatic malformation. Lymphatic malformations are benign, congenital abnormalities that can occur anywhere in the body, including the retroperitoneum. They are characterized by cystic spaces filled with lymphatic fluid. In this case, the cystic structure is causing mass effect and displacement of organs, which is indicative of a lymphatic malformation. The other answer options, retroperitoneal abscess, urinoma, and pancreatic pseudocyst, are less likely based on the presentation and imaging findings.

The correct answer is B: Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

Explanation:
The patient's history of progressive right-sided nasal congestion, facial swelling, pain, blurred vision, and weight loss, along with the CT scan findings of complete opacification and an invasive process centered in the right maxillary sinus, are consistent with chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. The endoscopic biopsy showing inflammatory changes and numerous fungal organisms consistent with Aspergillus species further supports this diagnosis. Treatment with intravenous antifungal medications is appropriate in this case. Fungal ball (choice A) typically presents as an asymptomatic, non-invasive fungal colonization within a sinus cavity. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma (choice C) would present with different clinical features and would not typically be associated with fungal organisms seen on biopsy. Therefore, the correct answer is chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.
D
1313
I choose B: Well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx.

Explanation: Based on the clinical information provided, the patient presented with a foreign body sensation in the throat, voice fatigue, and a laryngeal mass. The biopsy revealed a tumor composed of adipocytes in a fibromyxoid background, with atypical spindle cells and scattered lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical staining for CDK4 and MDM2 was positive. These findings are consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma, a rare type of malignant tumor that arises from fat cells.
B
1314
The diagnosis is D: Chronic hematoma.

Explanation: The imaging findings, including a T2 hyperintense lesion within the right pterygoid muscles without mass effect or invasive features, along with sequential increased enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted images, are consistent with a chronic hematoma. The small focus of signal void on T2-weighted images suggests the presence of tiny calcifications within the lesion. The increased tracer pooling within the lesion on single-proton emission computed tomography-CT (SPECT-CT) using technetium Tc 99m-labeled red blood cells further supports the diagnosis of a hemorrhagic lesion.

Option A, Rhabdomyosarcoma, is less likely since there are no mass effect or invasive features seen on imaging.

Option B, Venous malformation, is less likely as a venous malformation typically presents as a well-circumscribed mass with phleboliths and a characteristic appearance on imaging.

Option C, Masticator space abscess, is less likely as there is no evidence of infection or adjacent edema on the imaging studies.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the imaging findings is a chronic hematoma.
B
1315
The correct answer is B: Adult rhabdomyoma.

Explanation: The presentation of dysphagia and a pyriform sinus mass suggests a hypopharyngeal lesion. The immunohistochemical stains that were positive for myogenin, desmin, and myoglobin indicate a tumor originating from striated muscle. This, along with the histopathological description of large, round-to-polygonal cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, suggests a diagnosis of adult rhabdomyoma. The presence of intracellular vacuoles is a processing artifact due to intracellular glycogen loss.
B
1316
The correct answer is C: Fibrosarcoma.

Explanation: 
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient has a mass in the infratemporal fossa that has caused destruction of surrounding structures. The histopathological findings of spindle cells arranged in long fascicles with abundant interstitial collagen, and positive immunostaining for smooth muscle actin and β-catenin while negative for stains specific for other tumors, are consistent with fibrosarcoma. Pleomorphic adenoma would typically present as a slowly growing, painless mass in the salivary glands, with a characteristic biphasic appearance on histology. Desmoid tumors are typically seen in extra-abdominal sites and are characterized by infiltrative growth. Rhabdomyosarcoma would show features of skeletal muscle differentiation on histopathology, which are not present in this case.
B
1317
The correct answer is C: Adrenal myelolipoma.

Explanation: Based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is adrenal myelolipoma. Adrenal myelolipoma is a benign tumor of the adrenal gland composed of adipose tissue and hematopoietic cells. Patients with adrenal myelolipomas are often asymptomatic, but in some cases, they can present with abdominal pain and other symptoms due to mass effect or bleeding into the tumor. The CT findings of a large adrenal mass without any specific characteristics, normal plasma levels of metanephrines, normetanephrines, cortisol, renin, and aldosterone, further support the diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma, as these findings are consistent with a nonfunctioning tumor. Adrenal liposarcoma would typically present with a more aggressive clinical course and exhibit invasion into surrounding structures. Renal hamartoma is a benign tumor of the kidney and would not explain the symptoms or the imaging findings described. Nonfunctional paragangliomas are rare tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia and often secrete catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and sweating, which are not present in this case.
C
cellvalue empty
1318
The answer is B: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

Explanation: The patient's history of alcohol abuse, previous episodes of hematemesis, and elevated liver function tests, amylase and lipase levels suggest alcoholic pancreatitis. The abdominal pain migrating from the left upper quadrant to the epigastric region is consistent with pancreatic involvement. The physical examination findings of tenderness in the epigastric region, elevated liver function tests, and the imaging findings of a mass lesion in the fundus and body of the stomach support the diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs commonly occur in the stomach and can present with abdominal pain, early satiety, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The biopsy results showing normal gastric mucosa are consistent with a mesenchymal tumor, like a GIST, rather than a primary gastric malignancy like leiomyosarcoma. Gastric duplications usually present in childhood and would unlikely present with the symptoms and findings described. Pancreatic pseudocysts typically do not present as an abdominal mass.

D: Refer to an ophthalmologist urgently for slit-lamp and dilated examination.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of iris heterochromia and unilateral eyelash hypertrichosis is concerning for an underlying eye condition. To properly evaluate and diagnose the cause of these symptoms, it is important to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive examination, including slit-lamp and dilated examination. This will allow for a thorough evaluation of the eyes and any potential underlying pathology. The other options, such as performing an eye and orbit computed tomography or ordering serologic studies, can be considered depending on the findings of the initial ophthalmologist examination. However, the first step should be to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.

B: Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's history of tattoos and the presence of skin lesions confined to the tattoos, obtaining a biopsy of the skin lesion is the next appropriate step. This will help determine the cause of the rash and guide further management. Other options such as prescribing topical corticosteroids or oral antibiotics may not be effective if the underlying cause is not identified. Ordering respiratory isolation and ruling out tuberculosis would be warranted if the patient had respiratory symptoms or if tuberculosis was suspected based on additional history or findings. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a dermatologic condition related to the tattoos.

B: Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of weight loss, dyspnea, cough, fevers, night sweats, painful hematuria, and the presence of skin lesions confined to his tattoos, further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause. The presence of bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest radiography suggests systemic involvement. Biopsy of the skin lesion can provide valuable information about the nature of the lesions and help guide the diagnosis and treatment. Prescribing topical corticosteroids or oral antibiotics without a confirmed diagnosis would be premature. Order respiratory isolation and ruling out tuberculosis may be considered if there are additional signs or symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, but further investigation is needed before taking this step.

B: Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion

Explanation:
Given the patient's symptoms of weight loss, dyspnea, cough, night sweats, and painful hematuria, along with the presence of skin lesions confined to his tattoos, it is important to further investigate these lesions. Obtaining a biopsy of the skin lesion would help in determining the underlying cause of the rash and whether it is related to the patient's systemic symptoms. This can provide valuable information for diagnosis and guide further management.

The answer is B: Further evaluation is required; repeat total testosterone measurement using an immunoassay.

Explanation: The patient's total testosterone level is below the normal reference range, indicating androgen deficiency. However, there can be variability in testosterone measurements based on the assay used, and mass spectrometry is the gold standard for accurate measurement. Therefore, it is recommended to repeat the total testosterone measurement using an immunoassay to confirm the low testosterone level before proceeding with further evaluation.

The correct answer is C: Propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis 

Explanation:
The patient's presentation, including painful lesions on the bilateral helices and a positive test for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs), is consistent with propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis. Propylthiouracil is an antithyroid drug that can cause various cutaneous manifestations, including purpura. The histopathologic examination of the punch biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and fibrin thrombi, further supporting the diagnosis of vasculitis. The patient's other medications and recent urinary tract infection treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin are less likely to be the cause of her presentation, as the lesions appeared while she was taking levofloxacin and the other medications are not typically associated with vasculopathy.

1323
The correct answer is C: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Explanation: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. The stellate red-brown patches seen on the distal extremities in this case are typical of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The absence of induration, scale, or ulceration is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of episodic muscle cramping and numbness involving the lower extremities can be associated with vasculitis. The skin biopsy specimen stained with hematoxylin-eosin shows evidence of leukocytoclastic debris within the blood vessel walls, confirming the diagnosis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis typically present with systemic symptoms and involve larger blood vessels. Polyarteritis nodosa primarily affects medium-sized and large arteries, and skin involvement is typically nodular rather than stellate.

My diagnosis is A: Basal cell carcinoma.
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a slowly enlarging, mobile, mammillated soft brown plaque on the scalp, along with dermoscopic findings of irregular pigment globules, milialike cysts, and focal arborizing vessels, are consistent with the features of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is the most common type of skin cancer and commonly presents as a slow-growing, non-healing, raised or ulcerated lesion with various clinical and dermoscopic features. Histopathologic examination, as shown in Figure C and D, would confirm the diagnosis. While other options such as apocrine poroma, congenital nevus, and seborrheic keratosis may have some overlapping features, the combination of clinical and dermoscopic findings in this case strongly suggests BCC as the most likely diagnosis.
B
cellvalue empty
1325
B: Frontotemporal dementia

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and neurological examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, and language, which align with the patient's symptoms of withdrawal from social interaction, personality changes, impaired judgment, and inappropriate emotional expression.

Neurological examination findings, such as decreased upgaze, mild facial masking, rigidity, dystonic posturing, and hyperreflexia, are consistent with FTD. The abnormal mental status with poor calculations and constructions, decreased short-term memory, and left frontotemporal sharp waves and slowing on EEG further support the diagnosis.

Brain imaging findings, specifically the PET scan showing right frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism, are typical in FTD and help differentiate it from other conditions.

Alzheimer disease can present with similar symptoms, but the imaging findings in this case do not align with typical or atypical Alzheimer disease patterns. Progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration may also cause motor symptoms, but the predominant features in this case are the behavioral and cognitive changes, indicating FTD as the most likely diagnosis.

B: Frontotemporal dementia

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is characterized by progressive behavioral and personality changes, language difficulties, and impaired executive function. The patient exhibited personality changes, withdrawal from social interactions, impairment of judgment, inappropriate emotional responses (laughter and tears), inattention, fatigue, memory impairment, visuoperceptive changes, and obsessive checking behaviors, all of which are common features of FTD. The abnormal mental status, decreased short-term memory, poor calculations and constructions, and decreased upgaze and facial masking observed on examination further support the diagnosis of FTD. The neuroimaging findings of right frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism on PET are also consistent with FTD.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Frontotemporal dementia

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), also known as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. FTD is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, causing changes in behavior, personality, language, and motor function.

The patient's symptoms of gait dysfunction, balance impairment, personality changes, judgment impairment, visuoperceptive changes, memory impairment, and motor problems are all characteristic of FTD. The abnormal mental status, poor calculations, decreased short-term memory, and decreased upgaze seen on neurological examination further support this diagnosis. The cranial nerve examination findings of decreased upgaze and mild facial masking are also consistent with FTD.

The brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging showing right frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism with some sensorimotor sparing is a typical pattern seen in FTD. The MRI of the brain being reported as unremarkable is not uncommon in FTD, as structural imaging may not always show significant abnormalities.

Alzheimer's disease (Option A) typically presents with memory impairment as an early symptom, which was not the presenting symptom in this case. Progressive supranuclear palsy (Option C) and corticobasal degeneration (Option D) can cause motor problems similar to those seen in this case, but they usually do not present with the prominent cognitive and behavioral changes seen in FTD. Therefore, Frontotemporal dementia (Option B) is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and examination findings.

B: External beam radiotherapy

Explanation: Given the presence of a new pigmented lesion on the sclera at the site of the previous choroidal melanoma, it is concerning for potential recurrence or metastasis. External beam radiotherapy can be considered as a treatment option for local control of the tumor. Enucleation may be necessary in more advanced cases or if there is evidence of extensive tumor growth or metastasis. Observation without any intervention may not be appropriate given the likelihood of tumor recurrence or growth. Repeat iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy may not be effective since the initial treatment did not completely eliminate the tumor.

The appropriate next step in managing this case of advanced chloroquine retinopathy would be to (A) Discontinue treatment with chloroquine. 

Explanation: Chloroquine is known to cause retinal toxicity, particularly in patients who have been taking it for a prolonged period and at high doses. The symptoms and examination findings described in the case are consistent with the retinal toxicity caused by chloroquine. Therefore, the most important step is to discontinue the use of chloroquine to prevent further damage to the retina. Treatment options for chloroquine retinopathy are limited and mainly focused on supportive measures and monitoring for progression. Reassuring and observing (B) would not be appropriate as the retinopathy has already advanced and is causing visual impairment. Intravitreous corticosteroids (C) are not indicated for the treatment of chloroquine retinopathy. Examining family members for macular dystrophy (D) is not necessary in this case as the retinal changes are a known side effect of chloroquine and not related to a hereditary condition.
The answer is C: Circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of well-defined follicular, pink, scaly papules coalescing into thin plaques on her knees, elbows, and dorsal hands and feet, along with marked orange-red hyperkeratosis and hyperlinearity of her palms, is characteristic of circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris (CjuPRP). CjuPRP is a rare form of PRP that typically occurs in children and is characterized by well-demarcated orange-red hyperkeratotic plaques and islands, particularly on the palms, soles, knees, and elbows. The follicular component, as seen in this patient's knees, is also a distinguishing feature of CjuPRP. The lack of response to topical corticosteroids further supports the diagnosis of CjuPRP, as this condition is often resistant to conventional treatments.

The correct answer is D: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of right-sided nasal obstruction and epistaxis, along with the imaging findings of a large mass filling the right anterior nasal cavity with opacification and bony remodeling of the right maxillary sinus, are consistent with juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). JNA is a benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that typically affects adolescent males. It arises from the sphenopalatine foramen and invades adjacent structures such as the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and nasopharynx.

The histopathologic findings of a sheet-like proliferation of epithelioid and polygonal cells with pale eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and positive staining for smooth muscle actin are typical of JNA. The branching, staghorn-like blood vessels scattered throughout the tumor are also characteristic.

Other options such as alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma, and malignant melanoma are less likely given the clinical presentation and histopathologic features described in the case.
B
1330
The diagnosis is option B: Rhabdomyosarcoma. 

Explanation: The progressive left periorbital swelling, orbital pain, and firm mass on examination suggest a space-occupying lesion. The CT and MRI findings demonstrate a soft-tissue mass with osseous destruction and erosion into adjacent structures, consistent with an aggressive infiltrative process. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor that commonly occurs in children and often presents with symptoms such as proptosis, periorbital swelling, and pain. It can invade surrounding structures, including bone, as demonstrated in this case. Metastatic neuroblastoma can also present with periorbital swelling but is less likely given the absence of typical neuroblastoma symptoms and the imaging findings of bone destruction. Lymphoma can rarely involve the orbit, but it typically presents as a painless mass without the aggressive bone destruction seen in this case. Lipoma would not exhibit the infiltrative growth pattern and bone destruction observed in the imaging.
B
1331
My diagnosis is B: Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis.

Explanation: Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNH) is a benign, painful nodule found on the helix of the ear. It is often caused by pressure and friction, such as from wearing tight-fitting headgear or sleeping on the affected side. CNH is more common in middle-aged and older individuals. 

The clinical presentation in this case, including the painful nodules on both ears, central crusting, and tenderness on palpation, is consistent with CNH. The histopathologic features described in the case, such as hyperkeratotic parakeratotic scale, eosinophilic degeneration of collagen, mild lymphomononuclear infiltrate, and normal underlying cartilage, are also characteristic of CNH.

Keratoacanthoma (A) is a rapidly growing, dome-shaped tumor that resembles squamous cell carcinoma but has a self-limiting course. Glomus tumors (C) are rare, benign neoplasms that arise from the glomus body and typically present as small, painful nodules in the subungual or subcutaneous tissue. Rheumatoid nodules (D) are seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and typically present as subcutaneous nodules, often on extensor surfaces. None of these conditions match the clinical and histopathologic features described in the case, making chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis the most likely diagnosis.
B
1332
The diagnosis is A: Osteolipoma.

Explanation: Osteolipoma is a rare benign tumor composed of mature adipose tissue and trabecular bone. It typically presents as a painless, slow-growing mass in the soft tissues, as seen in this case. CT imaging often reveals a well-defined, hyperdense mass with areas of fat attenuation. Osteolipomas are usually separate from the underlying bone and do not invade or erode it. Excision is the treatment of choice and is curative.
A
1333
My diagnosis is D: Primary central nervous system lymphoma.

Explanation: The MRI findings in this case, including the extensive ill-defined areas of FLAIR and T2 signal abnormalities with enhancing nodular foci in deep white matter structures, basal ganglia, caudate, pons, and midbrain, along with enhancement of the interpeduncular cistern and cerebral peduncles, are characteristic of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain, typically affecting immunocompromised individuals, but can also occur in immunocompetent patients. The clinical presentation of memory problems, depression, and increased sleep is consistent with PCNSL involvement of the brain. Other potential differential diagnoses such as inflammatory demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, neoplasms like multicentric glioma or metastases, and infectious causes such as tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, and toxoplasmosis can be ruled out based on the imaging findings and clinical presentation.

The answer is D: Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of episodic numbness and paresthesias in the feet, triggered by straining with urination and relieved by lying supine, are consistent with a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst. These cysts are typically located in the thoracic spine and can cause compression of the spinal cord, leading to neurological symptoms. The thoracic spine MRI with FIESTA sequences reveals a blurry spinal cord signal alteration at the T7-T8 level with deformation of the cord posteriorly, which is suggestive of an arachnoid cyst. Other potential diagnoses, such as anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation, malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord, and spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, do not fit with the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Based on the provided information and CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis for this case is B: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.

Explanation: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gallbladder characterized by the accumulation of macrophages and inflammatory cells, which can form nodules or masses. It often presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, similar to acute cholecystitis, but can have a more insidious onset. Ultrasonography may reveal thickening of the gallbladder wall and CT scans can show soft-tissue masses associated with the gallbladder. The absence of pericholecystic fluid and normal blood tests help differentiate it from acute cholecystitis. Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the gallbladder.

B: D-dimer test result is positive. The diagnosis of PE is confirmed.

Explanation: A positive D-dimer test result indicates the presence of elevated levels of D-dimer, which is a breakdown product of blood clots. In the context of this case, where the patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism (PE), a positive D-dimer test supports the diagnosis of PE. However, further imaging tests such as a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan are required to confirm the diagnosis. The Wells score suggests that the clinical probability of PE is unlikely, but a positive D-dimer test increases the suspicion.

B: Perform a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treat with valacyclovir 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a painful rash and vesicles is concerning for a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV). Performing a direct fluorescent antibody test can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Empirically starting valacyclovir, an antiviral medication effective against both HSV and VZV, is appropriate in this case. Blood cultures and intravenous vancomycin would be more appropriate in a patient with suspected systemic infection, which does not appear to be the case here. ANCA titers may be considered in patients with suspected vasculitis, but this patient's presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Starting a high-potency topical steroid would not be appropriate without a confirmed diagnosis.

The diagnosis for this case is D: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of diffuse papular eruption along with systemic symptoms such as fever, weakness, and malaise, as well as findings of splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, are suggestive of a neoplastic process. The peripheral blood smear (Figure D) is characteristic of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, showing atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli, known as "flower cells". This finding is associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection, which is linked to the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The skin findings in this case are consistent with cutaneous involvement seen in this malignancy.

The diagnosis is C: Paraneoplastic pemphigus. 

Explanation: Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that is associated with underlying malignancies, most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is characterized by blistering eruptions involving the skin and mucous membranes, including the oral cavity. In this case, the patient presented with widespread erosions, tense and flaccid bullae, and painful oral lesions. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen showed suprabasal acantholysis and a dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and scattered eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) tests were positive, supporting the diagnosis of PNP. Treatment typically involves management of the underlying malignancy and immunosuppressive therapy.

The diagnosis for this case is B: Tumid lupus erythematosus.

Explanation: Tumid lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which typically presents as erythematous plaques and nodules. These lesions are often tender to palpation and can occur in areas adjacent to previous trauma or scarring, such as in this case after arthroscopy. Tumid lupus erythematosus is characterized by a lack of epidermal changes, unlike other subtypes of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The clinical presentation, along with the history of systemic lupus erythematosus and characteristic histopathologic findings (not shown), support the diagnosis of tumid lupus erythematosus in this patient.

B: Computed tomographic scan of the orbit

Explanation: A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbit would be the next appropriate step in evaluating the extent and characteristics of the mass. This would provide more detailed information about the size, location, and involvement of surrounding structures. It can help determine the appropriate management approach and guide further treatment decisions. Exenteration and enucleation are surgical procedures that may be considered based on the CT findings. Testing for HIV may be indicated as a part of the patient's workup, but it should not be the immediate next step in this case.

D: Blood tests to consider diagnosis of syphilitic chorioretinitis.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of breast carcinoma with positive lymph nodes and the presence of serous macular detachment with turbid subretinal fluid, a differential diagnosis should include choroidal metastasis. However, in this case, the absence of retinal pigment epithelium leakage, a smokestack pattern of subretinal leakage, or RPE gutter defects on fluorescein angiography suggests an alternative diagnosis should be considered. Syphilitic chorioretinitis can present with similar clinical findings, including serous macular detachment. Therefore, blood tests to evaluate for syphilis should be performed to rule out this possibility.

The correct answer is B: Kawasaki syndrome.

Explanation: The characteristic nail findings in this case, including semilunar whitish grooves in the middle of the fingernails and transverse partial cracks with distal onycholysis in the toenails, are consistent with the findings seen in Kawasaki syndrome. Kawasaki syndrome is an acute systemic vasculitis that primarily affects young children. Aside from nail changes, other symptoms of Kawasaki syndrome include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, erythema of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, cervical lymphadenopathy, and swelling of the hands and feet. It is important to make the correct diagnosis promptly as Kawasaki syndrome can lead to serious complications, such as coronary artery aneurysms.

The correct answer is D: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a 7-month history of sinus obstruction and congestion, along with hyposmia, facial pressure, and headaches, is suggestive of a sinonasal tumor. Computed tomography revealed a mass in the ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity. Nasal endoscopy showed a friable, polypoid mass extending into the nasal cavity and superiorly to the skull base. A biopsy specimen revealed a heterogeneous tumor with small, angulated, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, apoptosis, and mitosis. Malignant glands lined by cuboidal cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm were also observed, along with luminal mucin production. Additionally, rhabdomyoblasts, characterized by scattered round cells with abundant eosinophilic, refractile cytoplasm, were present. These rhabdomyoblasts showed strong positive staining for desmin and myogenin.

Based on these findings, the correct diagnosis is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a high-grade malignant neoplasm derived from skeletal muscle cells. It commonly occurs in children and young adults and accounts for about 20% of all rhabdomyosarcomas. The presence of rhabdomyoblasts in the biopsy specimen, along with the clinical and radiological findings, support this diagnosis.
B
1346
The diagnosis for this case is B: Lobular capillary hemangioma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of increasing headache, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and nasal congestion, along with the findings of a large polypoid nasal mass obstructing the nasal passage and eroding through the cribriform plate with adjacent dural enhancement on MRI, are characteristic of a lobular capillary hemangioma. Intraoperative pathologic examination showed polypoid spindle cell proliferation, and histopathologic findings confirmed the presence of respiratory epithelium with submucosal vascular proliferation. The images provided also show the characteristic features including a central vessel surrounded by lobules of endothelial-lined capillaries. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma typically occurs in young males and presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain, but it is usually more posteriorly located than observed in this case. Inverting papilloma is a benign tumor that originates from the sinonasal tract and typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. Respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma is a benign neoplasm that is typically an incidental finding and does not usually cause symptoms.

1347
Letter C: Osteochondroma

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a mass in the oropharynx, along with the imaging findings of a segmented bony lesion at the odontoid process and the body of the C2 vertebra, is consistent with an osteochondroma. Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that commonly occurs in the long bones but can also be found in the craniofacial region. The high signal intensity with a hypointense rim seen on T1- and T2-weighted MRI images further supports this diagnosis. The excision of the mass, performed using a per-oral approach, confirms the need for surgical removal in this case.

My diagnosis is B: Pleomorphic adenoma.

Explanation: Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor, and it can occur in the minor salivary glands of the soft palate. The gradually enlarging soft palate mass, along with the absence of pain, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing, are consistent with a benign tumor. The findings from the physical examination, flexible nasopharyngoscopy, and imaging (MRI) are also typical of a pleomorphic adenoma. The lesion was easily excised and there was no infiltration of surrounding tissue, which further supports the diagnosis.
B
1349
B: Extramammary Paget disease

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation of a persistent, pruritic, and enlarging scaly lesion in the inguinal and scrotal area, along with the history of previous biopsies suggesting lichen simplex chronicus, the most likely diagnosis is extramammary Paget disease.

This rare condition is characterized by the presence of intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells, which can present as an erythematous, scaly lesion resembling dermatitis or eczema. It commonly affects the anogenital area and can extend to nearby areas such as the inguinal creases.

Other differential diagnoses, such as fungal infections (A), Bowen disease (C), or lichen sclerosis (D), may be considered, but the clinical presentation and history are more consistent with extramammary Paget disease. Further evaluation, such as confirmatory biopsy and immunohistochemistry, may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

The correct answer is C: Polycystic liver disease.

Explanation: The patient's history of polycystic kidney disease and renal transplantation is suggestive of a possible genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. The abdominal magnetic resonance image shows a giant multinodular mass occupying most of the upper abdomen, which is consistent with polycystic liver disease. This condition is characterized by the development of multiple liver cysts, which can cause abdominal distention and discomfort. The diagnosis is confirmed by the intraoperative photograph, which shows the giant multinodular mass. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is polycystic liver disease.

1351
D: Echinococcal disease.

Explanation: The patient's history of living in Beijing, China, where echinococcal disease is endemic, along with her reported activities of running in areas with dog feces and consuming sheep meat, raise suspicion for echinococcal disease. The presence of calcifications in the cysts on the CT scan further supports this diagnosis. Serologic tests for Echinococcus antibody IgG were negative, however, it is known that serologic tests can have low sensitivity. Therefore, echinococcal disease should still be considered the most likely diagnosis in this case. Splenic abscess would be less likely given the presence of calcifications. Congenital cyst and cystic metastasis to the spleen are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.
D

1352
The answer is B: The patient has euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.

Explanation: 

To interpret the test results, we need to consider the patient's volume status and serum sodium level. 

In this case, the blood pressure is within normal limits, which suggests normal volume status. Additionally, there is no evidence of peripheral edema, further supporting euvolemia. 

The patient's serum sodium level is low (hyponatremia), indicating a low concentration of sodium in the blood. 

Putting these findings together, the patient has euvolemic (normal volume status) and hypotonic (low sodium concentration) hyponatremia. This could be due to various causes, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency. 

Considering the patient's medical history and medications, SIADH can be a possible cause, as certain medications like opioids, cyclobenzaprine, and haloperidol can stimulate ADH release. However, further evaluation and testing are required to confirm the underlying cause.

1353
C: Perform skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence.

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Since the patient has refractory pruritus despite previous treatments, further evaluation is warranted. Performing a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence can confirm the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis and rule out other potential diagnoses. Additionally, this can guide treatment decisions and help to exclude other more serious conditions such as malignancy. A complete blood cell count and creatinine level can also be obtained to evaluate for any underlying systemic complications, but performing a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence should be the next step in the evaluation of this patient. Examination for infestation with scabies is unlikely given the chronicity and extensive distribution of the eruption. A chest radiograph would not be indicated at this point.

1354
Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has moderate aortic valve stenosis with the severity overestimated by Doppler measurements. This is indicated by the presence of a 2/4 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is characteristic of aortic stenosis. However, it is important to note that Doppler measurements can sometimes overestimate the severity of valvular stenosis, particularly in patients with significant left ventricular hypertrophy or calcification. Further evaluation, such as a transesophageal echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization, may be required to accurately assess the severity of the aortic stenosis.
B: Perform lumbar puncture with patient in upright position to measure opening pressure and examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) components.

Explanation: The presence of severe bilateral optic disc edema (papilledema) along with other symptoms such as blurry vision, pulsing sounds in the ears, and multiple bony sclerotic lesions seen on the CT scan, suggests increased intracranial pressure (ICP). To confirm this diagnosis and assess the cause of increased ICP, a lumbar puncture should be performed with the patient in an upright position to measure the opening pressure and examine the CSF components. This will help determine if there is any evidence of elevated CSF pressure or other abnormal CSF findings, which can guide further management. Performing a skeletal survey or ordering MRI/MRV would be appropriate, but the initial step should be to evaluate the CSF. Lastly, performing serum and urine protein electrophoresis would be indicated if there is suspicion for an underlying systemic disorder causing increased ICP, such as a monoclonal gammopathy.

The diagnosis is A: Pyoderma gangrenosum.

Explanation: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, neutrophilic, ulcerative dermatosis. It can be associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic malignancies. However, in about half of the cases, no associated systemic disease is found. Pyoderma gangrenosum typically presents as a painful, rapidly progressing ulcer with a necrotic base and undermined violaceous borders. The ulcers are usually located on the lower extremities but can occur in other areas of the body as well. The diagnosis is clinical, but skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. Treatment involves systemic immunosuppressive therapy, such as corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory agents.

1357
The correct diagnosis is D: Granuloma inguinale.

Explanation: Granuloma inguinale, also known as Donovanosis, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Klebsiella granulomatis. It commonly presents as a painless, slowly enlarging genital ulcer or nodule. In this case, the patient's presentation with a pedunculated growth on the buttock fits the typical appearance of a granuloma inguinale. The marked epidermal hyperplasia and dense dermal infiltrate seen on histopathologic examination further support this diagnosis.

Condyloma acuminata (choice A) and condyloma lata (choice B) are both manifestations of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and syphilis, respectively. Verrucous herpes simplex virus (choice C) is not a recognized entity, and the presentation in the case description is not consistent with herpes infection. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is granuloma inguinale.
B
cellvalue empty
1358
The correct diagnosis is C: Mucosal leishmaniasis.

Explanation: Mucosal leishmaniasis is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, which is transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies. It typically presents as a nonhealing ulcer in the oronasal mucosa. In this case, the patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the tongue for 4 months, which gradually grew and ulcerated. The ulcer had elevated margins and a clean base. The histopathological examination revealed intracellular yeast forms within the histiocytes, which is characteristic of leishmaniasis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a possibility, but the absence of induration, friability, or bleeding on manipulation makes it less likely.

Primary oral histoplasmosis is also a possibility, but in this case, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings are more consistent with mucosal leishmaniasis.

Tubercular chancre is unlikely in this case as there is no mention of associated systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy, which are commonly seen in tuberculosis.

Answer: B

Explanation: The appropriate technique for removing the fishhook in this case is the Advance-and-cut technique. This involves rotating the hook anterogradely, clipping the barb, and then backing out the hook retrogradely through the entry wound. This technique minimizes trauma to the surrounding tissues and reduces the risk of further injury.
B: Magnetic resonance imaging and/or venography

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of visual disturbance, confusion, and ataxia, along with the findings of disc edema and intraretinal hemorrhages on fundus examination, a central nervous system (CNS) etiology should be considered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or venography can help identify any structural abnormalities or vascular pathology in the brain, including the possibility of intracranial hypertension or venous sinus thrombosis. This imaging modality will provide further information to guide appropriate management and treatment for the patient. Lumbar puncture may be considered if the MRI is inconclusive or if suspicion of intracranial hypertension remains. Intravenous vitamin therapy and intravenous corticosteroids would not be appropriate initial management options for this patient.
C

1361
The diagnosis is D: Aspiration.

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings of choking with feeds and a large volume of clear oral secretions requiring frequent suctioning, along with the history of difficulty breathing and apnea requiring resuscitation, aspiration is the most likely diagnosis. Aspiration occurs when foreign material (in this case, food or fluids) enter the airway instead of going down the esophagus and reaching the stomach. This can lead to respiratory distress and other complications. A fluoroscopic video swallowing study (FVSS) can help further evaluate the swallowing mechanism and identify any abnormalities or dysfunctions that may contribute to the aspiration.

A: Carcinoma of the gallbladder

Explanation: The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, weight loss, asthenia, and a greatly enlarged gallbladder with a thickened wall infiltrating the liver parenchyma is highly suggestive of carcinoma of the gallbladder. Other findings, including the positive Murphy sign and elevated C-reactive protein level, further support this diagnosis. The absence of significant laboratory abnormalities and normal results of other imaging studies make other diagnoses such as acute cholecystitis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, and lymphoma less likely in this case.
C
cellvalue empty
1363
The correct answer is B: Small-bowel volvulus.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of abdominal distention and vomiting after feeding, along with the presence of dilated small-bowel loops on abdominal radiograph, suggests bowel obstruction. The right-sided labial swelling may be indicative of a hernia or hydrocele. The normal pattern of rotation observed on radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract rules out malrotation/volvulus as the cause of the obstruction. The presence of ganglion cells in the rectal biopsy rules out Hirschsprung disease. The retained contrast in the terminal ileum on serial abdominal radiographic images is consistent with small-bowel volvulus, as it indicates partial or complete obstruction in that region, potentially due to twisting of the bowel. Ovarian cyst with torsion is less likely in this case as the imaging does not support this diagnosis.
D
cellvalue empty
1364
The answer option is: C: The patient has lactic acidosis from mesenteric ischemia.

Explanation: The elevated lactate levels in the patient can be attributed to mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric ischemia occurs when there is inadequate blood flow to the mesenteric vessels supplying the intestines. This can lead to tissue hypoxia and the production of lactate. The patient's symptoms of chronic abdominal pain, presence of a large mesenteric mass encasing the mesenteric vasculature on CT scan, and lack of improvement in lactate levels despite fluid resuscitation support the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia. Hypovolemic shock and sepsis can cause lactic acidosis, but in this case, mesenteric ischemia is the most likely cause.

1365
Based on the given information, the most appropriate next step would be A: Start intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and obtain serum lactate level and blood and sputum cultures.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with dyspnea and chest wall tenderness after a choking incident suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. This is supported by the low oxygen saturation and improvement with supplemental oxygen, as well as the history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Therefore, starting intravenous antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infection is necessary. Obtaining serum lactate level and blood and sputum cultures will help to identify the causative organism and guide the choice of antibiotics. Intravenous fluid resuscitation may be needed to support the patient's respiratory status and prevent further complications.

1366
C: Order computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of multiple dark skin lesions, weight loss, and presence of lesions in the mouth raise concerns for potential underlying malignancy. To evaluate for possible metastatic disease or primary malignancy, it is necessary to order imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This will help assess the extent of disease and guide further management.
D

1367
The correct answer is C: Hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert syndrome.

Explanation:
Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition characterized by intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is a common inherited disorder caused by reduced bilirubin glucuronidation due to a deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. This deficiency can result in elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood.

In this case, the patient is asymptomatic, without any signs or symptoms of liver disease. The other differential diagnoses can be ruled out based on the clinical history and physical examination findings. Cholelithiasis would typically cause obstructive jaundice and may be associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and the presence of bilirubin in hepatocytes. Hemolysis would result in increased levels of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin and may be associated with symptoms such as jaundice and anemia.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's elevated bilirubin levels in the absence of symptoms is Gilbert syndrome. Further confirmatory testing, such as genetic analysis and assessment of bilirubin glucuronidation, may be performed if necessary.

1368
The diagnosis for this case is D: Florid papillomatosis of the nipple.

Explanation: Florid papillomatosis of the nipple is a benign proliferative lesion of the lactiferous ducts. It typically presents as a painless subareolar nodule and is often associated with nipple discharge. Mammographic findings include an irregular group of calcifications extending into the nipple and skin, which can mimic malignancy. Ultrasound can show multiple echogenic foci corresponding to the calcifications seen on mammography. Histopathologic evaluation of an incisional biopsy specimen typically reveals complex papillary projections lined by a dual-layered epithelium with focal atypia, but no invasion. It is important to differentiate florid papillomatosis from intraductal papilloma, which can also present with nipple discharge and nipple masses but is less commonly associated with calcifications on mammography.

1369
The diagnosis is D: Peeling skin disease.

Explanation: Peeling skin disease, also known as keratolysis exfoliativa, is a rare condition characterized by superficial skin erosions and skin fragility since early infancy. The skin lesions often have linear geographic contours and are located predominantly at areas of friction. Symptoms tend to improve in winter and worsen in summer. There is no blistering in this condition.

In the provided clinical photographs, the superficial erosions seen on the trunk and the erythemato-desquamative plaque with peeling borders on the right foot are consistent with peeling skin disease.

The skin biopsy results show remarkable detachment of the entire stratum corneum (topmost layer of the epidermis) and psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, which are characteristic findings of peeling skin disease.

Kindler syndrome (A) is characterized by blistering and skin fragility, and it typically presents in early childhood. The skin findings in this case are not consistent with Kindler syndrome.

Dermatitis artefacta (B) refers to self-inflicted skin lesions caused by deliberate manipulation. The skin findings in this case do not suggest self-inflicted injury.

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis (C) is a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa characterized by skin fragility and blistering, usually in response to minor trauma. The skin findings in this case are not consistent with epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Peeling skin disease.

1370
The correct answer is D: Burkitt lymphoma of the breast.

Explanation: The combination of breast enlargement, induration (hardening), and failure to respond to antibiotics in a lactating woman should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis, such as malignancy. The skin biopsy specimen exhibited diffuse infiltrate of medium-sized lymphoid cells with mildly irregular nuclear contours, as well as numerous mitotic figures and apoptotic cells, consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. The patient's symptoms involving the back, mandibular region, and diplopia suggest spread of disease to the central nervous system. The laboratory findings of anemia and thrombocytopenia are consistent with bone marrow involvement by the lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma rarely involves the breast, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast enlargement and induration during lactation that does not respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (option A) is unlikely to externally manifest as indurated breast. In addition, it is rare for a patient to present with isolated leukemia of the breast.
Breast implant foreign body reaction (option B) is unlikely in this case since the patient's history does not indicate that she underwent breast implant surgery.
Severe postpartum mastitis (option C) is less likely given the lack of improvement with multiple courses of antibiotics over two months and the presence of other systemic symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Burkitt lymphoma of the breast (option D).

1371
B: Brain imaging and echocardiography.

Explanation: Given the presence of retinal astrocytic hamartomas, additional evaluation is needed to rule out associated conditions. Brain imaging (such as magnetic resonance imaging) will help identify any intracranial lesions that may be associated with the retinal findings. Echocardiography is necessary to evaluate for potential cardiac manifestations, as certain syndromes may have systemic involvement. Renal ultrasonography and lumbar puncture may not be directly relevant to the retinal findings, and a metastatic workup is not indicated in this case. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the ocular lesion may not be necessary at this point, as the diagnosis can be confirmed through imaging.
B
cellvalue empty
1372
B: Check antinuclear antibody level

Explanation: The patient is presenting with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages and retinal vascular abnormalities, which can be indicative of underlying autoimmune conditions. Checking the antinuclear antibody (ANA) level can help evaluate for possible autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect the blood vessels and cause ocular manifestations. Other symptoms such as arthritis and the patient's history of hyperlipidemia may also be associated with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, checking the ANA level is the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's condition.

B: Kerion celsi

Explanation: Kerion celsi is a severe inflammatory form of scalp ringworm (tinea capitis) that is characterized by a tender, boggy nodule with suppurative discharge and hair loss. It often occurs in children and is typically associated with a marked immune response to the fungal infection. The presence of annular scaly patches on the scalp and upper back, along with lymphadenopathy, further supports the diagnosis of kerion celsi. Mycobacterial infection would present differently and is less likely in this case. Dissecting cellulitis and abscess are also less likely as they do not have the characteristic features seen in this patient.

1374
C: Retroperitoneal sarcoma

Explanation: The presence of a large exophytic retroperitoneal mass with solid and cystic components, along with its involvement of the left kidney, posterior abdominal wall, and mesocolon, is suggestive of a retroperitoneal sarcoma. This is the most likely diagnosis given the location and characteristics of the mass. Lymphoma and malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst are less likely based on the imaging findings. Primary neoplasm arising from the kidney would typically present with a mass confined to the kidney and not involve adjacent structures.

A: Colon cancer perforation

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient has a history of a large obstructed sigmoid colon mass with fistulous extensions to the bladder and small bowel, as well as multiple metastases to the liver, peritoneum, and omentum. Pathologic analysis of a biopsy specimen confirmed the presence of a moderately differentiated colon adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent a stent placement procedure, and subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and free air on computed tomography, indicating a perforation of the colon. This is consistent with a complication of colon cancer, known as gastrointestinal perforation.

Answer: D: Perform a skin scraping with microscopy.

Explanation: The presentation of a diffuse rash with crust and scale, hyperkeratotic areas over bony prominences, and linear excoriations in a patient with AIDS is concerning for a possible superimposed fungal infection, such as seborrheic dermatitis or tinea corporis. To further evaluate for a possible fungal infection, a skin scraping with microscopy can be performed to look for fungal elements, such as hyphae or spores. This will help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's elevated lactate level suggests tissue hypoperfusion, which can be caused by various factors. In this case, the epinephrine administration can stimulate β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to an increase in lactate production due to enhanced glycolysis. This is a known effect of epinephrine and can explain the patient's hyperlactatemia.
D: Unroof one of the papules and send for viral culture.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of multiple bright pink papules with a central yellow hue on the extensor surfaces is characteristic of eruptive xanthomas. These are cutaneous manifestations of underlying hypertriglyceridemia. Given the patient's obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes, and history of pancreatitis, it is important to evaluate his lipid profile. However, obtaining a lipid panel would not be the initial next step in the management of this patient.

Ordering a chest radiograph would not be indicated as the patient does not have any respiratory symptoms or signs suggestive of lung involvement.

Treating empirically with oral prednisone would not be appropriate as there is no indication of an inflammatory or autoimmune condition causing the rash.

Unroofing one of the papules and sending the sample for viral culture is important in order to rule out any viral etiology for the rash, such as molluscum contagiosum or viral warts. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate next step in this case.

The correct answer is C: This audiogram depicts a right-sided SNHL and impaired speech discrimination, which necessitate further investigation.

Explanation: The audiogram shows a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) on the right side, as evidenced by the air conduction thresholds being worse than the bone conduction thresholds. Additionally, there is impaired speech discrimination, indicated by the low scores in the speech discrimination test. These findings suggest a problem with the inner ear or auditory nerve. Further investigation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the hearing loss and impaired speech discrimination.

The Diagnosis is A: Erythema nodosum.

Explanation: Erythema nodosum is a subcutaneous panniculitis characterized by tender, erythematous nodules typically located on the shins. It is commonly associated with various underlying systemic conditions such as infections (e.g., streptococcal, tuberculosis), inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, medication reactions, and rarely malignancies or autoimmune disorders. Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea, along with the absence of other specific risk factors, erythema nodosum is the most likely diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of the punch biopsy would confirm the diagnosis.

1381
B: Calciphylaxis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a well-defined purpuric patch with a darker stellate patch within it, along with the patient's medical history of severe peripheral arterial disease and a remote history of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, is highly suggestive of calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and potentially fatal condition characterized by ischemic skin necrosis due to small-vessel occlusion by calcification. It most commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease and is associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Biopsy findings of the tissue showing needle-shaped clefts within the lumen of a blood vessel with minimal perivascular inflammation (Figure B) are consistent with calciphylaxis. Additionally, cellular dyshesion and necrosis in the eccrine ducts (Figure C) are also consistent with calciphylaxis. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Calciphylaxis.

Answer: C: Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is dyshidrosiform pemphigoid. Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that typically affects the hands and feet. It is characterized by the formation of tense bullae on the palms and soles, which can lead to erosions and difficulty with ambulation. The biopsy findings, showing a subepidermal blister with inflammatory infiltrate, are consistent with dyshidrosiform pemphigoid. The absence of vesicular or bullous lesions on other body areas or mucosal surfaces helps to differentiate it from other conditions such as bullous tinea pedis and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Allergic contact dermatitis is unlikely in this case as there is no history of exposure to new irritants or allergens.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate next step would be to take letter D: Refer to otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms, including a painful red eye, nasal congestion, and elevated inflammatory markers, along with the finding of a nasal mass, are concerning for a possible underlying systemic condition. Given the patient's history of sinusitis and the lack of improvement with previous treatment, it is important to further investigate the nasal mass to rule out any serious underlying pathology. Referral to an otolaryngologist for a nasal mass biopsy will help in determining the cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further management.

A: Repeated neuroimaging

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including blurred vision, disc edema, and macular edema with exudates, along with the subtle enhancement of the left optic nerve on the initial magnetic resonance imaging, suggest the possibility of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis can be an early sign of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Repeating neuroimaging will help to further evaluate the optic nerve and rule out any new or evolving lesions.

1385
B: Neonatal lupus erythematosus

Explanation:
Based on the description provided, the most likely diagnosis for this 24-day-old neonate with annular plaques on the scalp is neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). NLE is a rare autoimmune disorder that can manifest in infants born to mothers with certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The characteristic skin findings in NLE include annular plaques with a red border and fine scaling, as well as pinpoint pustules.

Granuloma annulare (choice A) is a benign skin condition characterized by raised, flesh-colored or red bumps in a ring pattern. It is typically seen in older children and adults, and it is not common in infants.

Tinea capitis (choice C) refers to a fungal infection of the scalp. While it can cause scaling and circular patches, it is less likely in this case given the absence of contact with sick individuals or a family history of similar lesions.

Annular urticaria (choice D) is a type of urticaria (hives) characterized by pruritic (itchy) raised, circular lesions. Unlike NLE, annular urticaria typically presents with transient, rather than persistent, plaques.

Given the well-appearing and afebrile nature of the neonate, along with the absence of other concerning systemic symptoms, neonatal lupus erythematosus is the most likely diagnosis in this case. It is important to further evaluate and manage this condition, as neonatal lupus erythematosus can be associated with other organ involvement, such as cardiac abnormalities. Referral to a pediatric rheumatologist is recommended for further evaluation and management.

The answer is D: Radiographic artifact.

Explanation: The given imaging (Figure 1) shows a non-tapering filling defect within the left internal carotid artery (ICA), which may suggest left ICA stenosis. However, there are several clues that indicate this is a radiographic artifact rather than a genuine pathology. First, there is a straight edge at the proximal aspect of the defect, which is not seen in true occlusive lesions. Second, the defect does not taper distally, which is inconsistent with an embolus or a thrombus. Third, there is no distal embolization of the filling defect, demonstrated by the absence of any non-enhanced areas within the cerebral vasculature. Lastly, the patient's history of chronic occlusion of the right ICA further supports the possibility of an imaging artifact.

Radiographic artifacts can occur due to various reasons, including patient motion, beam hardening, or misregistration of imaging slices. In this case, the artifact is likely due to a combination of patient motion and misregistration during the acquisition of the computed tomographic angiography images.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is D: Radiographic artifact.

Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has a past medical history of total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer and is currently on levothyroxine suppression therapy. It is important to note that her serum calcium levels were normal before the thyroidectomy. This history suggests that the hypercalcemia is likely due to the thyroid suppression therapy. Therefore, Option B is the correct interpretation.
A: Perform skin biopsy for histopathology and culture.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a pustulonodular lesion on the nose, along with the history of injection drug use and tobacco abuse, raises concern for a possible infectious etiology, such as nasal cellulitis, abscess, or infection related to drug use. Given the severity and chronicity of the lesion, a skin biopsy for histopathology and culture would be the most appropriate next step to help determine the underlying cause and guide appropriate treatment.

The diagnosis in this case is C: Dermatitis herpetiformis.

Explanation: Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic autoimmune blistering disease associated with gluten sensitivity. It is characterized by the presence of intensely itchy skin lesions, typically distributed symmetrically in a grouped or clustered pattern. The lesions are usually found on the elbows, knees, buttocks, and back. However, in this case, the patient presented with a petechial eruption on the fingers. While this may not be a typical presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis, the linear arrangement of the petechiae and the histopathologic and immunofluorescence findings support the diagnosis. Direct immunofluorescence reveals granular IgA deposition within the dermal papillae and at the dermoepidermal junction, which is characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis. Treatment usually involves a gluten-free diet and medications to control the symptoms.

The correct answer is: C: Amyloidosis.

Explanation: Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of abnormally folded proteins called amyloids. In this case, the patient's presentation of trachyonychia (rough accentuated linear ridges on the nails), thin and brittle toenails, diffuse nonscarring alopecia, easy bruising, cutaneous laxity of the fingerpads, and the appearance of purpuric patches indicate a systemic amyloidosis affecting the skin, nails, and hair. The histopathologic examination of the nail bed, showing orange, amorphous material deposited in the subungual dermis with intense apple-green birefringence under polarized light, confirms the diagnosis of amyloidosis.

B: Treat with prednisolone acetate, 1%, ophthalmic solution 4 times per day

Explanation: The most appropriate initial step in managing this patient's conjunctival papillomatous lesion is to treat with topical corticosteroids, such as prednisolone acetate, to reduce inflammation and promote regression of the lesion. Conjunctival papillomas are generally benign lesions and can often be managed conservatively with observation and reassurance. Cryotherapy may be considered if the lesion persists or worsens despite conservative management. Orbital imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, is not generally indicated in the initial evaluation of conjunctival papillomas unless there are other concerning features suggesting deeper invasion or extension beyond the conjunctiva.

Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be C: Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment, with or without concomitant needle biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation and the findings on examination, the most likely possibility is a choroidal melanoma. The small area of shallow retinal detachment and associated retinal pigment epithelial pigment changes in the inferotemporal periphery are indicative of a choroidal lesion. Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment is a common treatment approach for choroidal melanoma. This treatment involves applying a radioactive plaque to the exterior surface of the eye, delivering targeted radiation to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.

A needle biopsy can be performed simultaneously with the plaque treatment to confirm the diagnosis and provide additional information about the tumor.

Excisional biopsy (choice A) or Incisional biopsy (choice B) may not be appropriate as they involve surgical removal of the lesion, which may not be necessary if the diagnosis is confirmed and treatment can be initiated with the radioactive plaque.

Observation (choice D) may not be appropriate as choroidal melanoma is a malignant tumor that requires treatment to prevent further progression and potential complications.

The correct answer is C: Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of fever, rash, and joint pain, along with the presence of petechial and pustular lesions on the hands and feet, are suggestive of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Option C). This disease is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, which is transmitted through tick bites. It commonly presents with fever, headache, rash, and joint pain. Petechial and pustular lesions are characteristic findings in the palms and soles. The laboratory findings of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are also consistent with this diagnosis. 

Option A is incorrect because disseminated gonococcal infection typically presents with symptoms related to the genitourinary tract, such as vaginal discharge, dysuria, and pelvic pain. It is not associated with a petechial rash.

Option B is incorrect because Streptobacillus moniliformis infection, also known as rat-bite fever, typically presents with fever, rash, and joint pain, but the rash is usually maculopapular and not petechial in nature.

Option D is incorrect because disseminated Staphylococcus aureus infection typically presents with fever and localized skin infections, such as abscesses or cellulitis, but it does not cause the characteristic petechial rash seen in this patient.

The answer is D: Gastric leiomyosarcoma.

Explanation: Gastric leiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the smooth muscle cells of the stomach wall. It can lead to symptoms such as weight loss, chronic diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In this case, the patient presented with severe weight loss, chronic diarrhea, and an immobile nontender mass in the left upper abdomen, which is suggestive of a malignancy. The presence of a large central necrotic mass on abdominal computed tomography further supports the diagnosis of gastric leiomyosarcoma. Other answer options such as gastrointestinal tuberculosis, gastrointestinal stromal tumor with central necrosis, and gastrocolic fistula are less likely to present with such symptoms and imaging findings.

The diagnosis is B: Meckel diverticulum.

Explanation: Meckel diverticulum is a congenital anomaly characterized by a outpouching of the small intestine that is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. It is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract and is typically located on the antimesenteric border of the distal ileum. Most patients with Meckel diverticulum are asymptomatic, but it can occasionally present with gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, or inflammation. In this case, the patient presented with persistent nausea and vomiting, iron deficiency anemia, and hemeoccult-positive stool, which are suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding. The retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy revealed an outpouching in the distal ileum and an ulceration of the adjacent mucosa, consistent with a Meckel diverticulum. Exploratory laparotomy with small-bowel resection confirmed the diagnosis.

The correct answer is C: Lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen.

Explanation: The clinical presentation, including sudden onset colicky pain in the epigastric and right upper quadrant, without migration, and occurring in paroxysms, along with physical examination findings of abdominal distension and hyperactive bowel sounds, are consistent with small bowel obstruction. The absence of peritonism suggests a closed-loop obstruction, which can occur due to internal hernias. The computed tomography (CT) images reveal an internal hernia through the epiploic foramen, also known as the foramen of Winslow, which is a potential site for internal hernias involving the lesser sac (omental bursa). This is seen as a passage of bowel loops from the left upper quadrant into the lesser sac. The other answer options, such as abscess of the lesser sac, perforated ulcer, or large diverticulum, do not fit with the clinical and CT findings of this case. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen (answer option C).

B: The patient most likely has monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

Explanation: The serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests showed a monoclonal spike in the gamma globulin region, indicating the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. However, the levels of the M-protein, the monoclonal protein, are relatively low, and there is no evidence of end-organ damage or other findings suggestive of multiple myeloma or Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is a benign condition that does not require treatment unless it progresses to a more severe form of disease.

Based on the provided information, the most appropriate next step would be to change dressings daily and implement hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Option A). 

Explanation:
This patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), a neutrophilic dermatosis that can occur in the setting of systemic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn disease. The typical features include rapid and painful progression of ulceration with violaceous-greyish necrotic borders. The lack of response to antibiotics and negative cultures support a diagnosis of PG over infection.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to be effective in promoting wound healing in PG, making it an appropriate therapeutic option in this case. It improves oxygenation and accelerates wound healing by increasing tissue oxygen tension and promoting neovascularization.

Prescribing systemic corticosteroids (Option B) would be a reasonable approach if the patient's symptoms were more consistent with an inflammatory bowel disease flare-up or if there was concern for an autoimmune or vasculitic etiology. However, given the characteristic appearance of the skin lesion and the lack of response to antibiotics, PG is the more likely diagnosis.

Surgically excising the lesion followed by skin grafting (Option C) is generally not recommended as the initial treatment for PG. Surgical intervention can trigger pathergy and lead to worsening of the ulceration. It is typically reserved for refractory cases or cases with large necrotic areas that need debridement.

Continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Option D) would not be appropriate as the clinical features and negative cultures argue against an underlying infection. Antibiotics do not have a significant role in the management of PG.
The correct answer is C: Type I non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with chest pain, associated symptoms, and electrocardiogram findings (T-wave inversion) are consistent with acute coronary syndrome. The elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial injury, which can occur in myocardial infarction (MI). Type I MI refers to spontaneous MI due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture leading to complete or subtotal occlusion of a coronary artery. In this case, the angiography showed mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease, but it is possible to have plaque rupture with minimal luminal stenosis. Therefore, this patient's troponin elevation is likely due to a type I non-ST-segment elevation MI.

Answer: A

Explanation: The reactive syphilis test results indicate that the patient has an active syphilis infection, specifically latent syphilis. Latent syphilis is the stage of the infection where there are no symptoms present but the infection is still present in the body. The recommended treatment for latent syphilis is a total of 7.2 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G, given as 2.4 million units weekly for 3 doses. Therefore, option A is the correct interpretation of the results.
D: Biopsy the affected tissue.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent gingival "peeling" associated with pain and bleeding, along with the presence of white patches on the oral mucosa for 7 years, warrants further investigation to establish a definitive diagnosis. In this case, a biopsy of the affected tissue would be the most appropriate next step to help determine the underlying cause of the lesions. This can provide histopathological examination and aid in establishing a diagnosis and subsequent management plan. Considerations for the biopsy include ruling out potential causes such as lichen planus, pemphigus, or other mucosal disorders.
D

1404
The correct diagnosis is A: Amyloidosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of ligneous conjunctivitis since childhood, along with the clinical presentation of recurrent oral mucosal ulcerations and gingival edema, raises suspicion for amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of abnormal insoluble fibrillar proteins called amyloid. In this case, the pseudomembranous masses affecting the conjunctival mucosa of the patient's left eye are consistent with ligneous conjunctivitis, which is a rare form of amyloidosis. The biopsy specimens obtained from the gingival ulcer show aggregates of eosinophilic material beneath the epithelium and around blood vessels, which is characteristic of amyloid deposits.

Systemic sclerosis (B) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by fibrosis of the skin and multiple organs. Hypoplasminogenemia (C) is a rare genetic disorder resulting in impaired wound healing and mucosal ulcers. Lipoid proteinosis (D) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hoarseness of voice and deposition of hyaline material in various organs, but it is not associated with amyloid deposits.

1405
The correct answer is C: Neonatal pemphigus vulgaris.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of widespread vesicles and erosions involving multiple body sites, along with the histopathologic findings of suprabasilar acantholysis with an eosinophilic infiltrate and the direct immunofluorescence demonstrating IgG in an intracellular "chicken wire" pattern, are consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris.

Epidermolysis bullosa, Dowling-Meara type (Option A) is a genodermatosis characterized by generalized blistering and erosions, but it typically presents in later infancy or early childhood, not at birth.

Neonatal herpesvirus infection (Option B) can cause vesicles and erosions in neonates, but it is often associated with involvement of the mucous membranes which are spared in this case.

Widespread bullous impetigo (Option D) typically presents with large bullae and honey-colored crusts, without the characteristic vesicles and erosions in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and direct immunofluorescence findings is neonatal pemphigus vulgaris.
C

1406
The diagnosis is D: Erythema annulare centrifugum, deep variant.

Explanation: Erythema annulare centrifugum is a reactive and self-limiting disorder characterized by annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders. It typically affects the trunk and proximal extremities, but in this case, the lesions are also present on the face. The deep variant of erythema annulare centrifugum is distinguished by its involvement of the deep dermis and subcutaneous fat. The absence of scaling, itching, or pain, as well as the rapid enlargement of the plaques, supports this diagnosis. The patient's recent sun exposure and febrile illness are likely triggering factors for the eruption. The histologic findings of distended sebaceous lobules with associated follicular dilatation, sebocyte necrosis, and an associated neutrophilic infiltrate are in line with the diagnosis. Granuloma annulare typically presents with non-scaly, flesh-colored papules and plaques, whereas cutaneous lupus usually exhibits scaly plaques or annular erythematous rash. Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis is a rare entity and does not explain the characteristic clinical and histologic features seen in this case.
C
cellvalue empty
1407
B: Erythema ab igne with superimposed chemotherapy effect

Explanation: The patient's history of sitting in front of a fireplace for long periods of time suggests the development of erythema ab igne, a localized skin reaction caused by chronic exposure to heat or infrared radiation. The presence of a large, reticulated, erythematous plaque with micaceous and silvery scale on the mid-back is consistent with this diagnosis. The punch biopsy findings also support the diagnosis, showing hyperkeratosis, dysmaturation of the epidermis, apoptotic cells, increased blood vessels, pigment incontinence, and perivascular inflammation with lymphocytes and eosinophils. The superimposed chemotherapy effect may explain the severity and chronicity of the eruption seen in this case. Psoriasis vulgaris would typically present with well-defined, red, scaly plaques on extensor surfaces, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Pityriasis rubra pilaris is characterized by widespread erythema, scaling, and follicular plugging, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus would show features of interface dermatitis, such as vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, apoptotic keratinocytes, and a lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, which are not seen in this case.

The answer option is: B: Obtain optical coherence tomography.

Explanation: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows for high-resolution imaging of the retina. It can provide detailed information about the retinal layers and help in the diagnosis and management of various retinal diseases. In this case, obtaining OCT will allow for a better visualization of the macula and help in assessing the presence of any structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's vision loss.

Ocular ultrasonography may be useful in certain cases, such as when there is poor visualization of the posterior segment due to media opacities. However, in this case, the fundus examination and imaging have already provided sufficient information about the retina, making ocular ultrasonography less necessary.

Blood tests for vasculitis workup may be considered if there are strong clinical indications for a systemic cause of the vision loss. However, in this case, the patient's history and presentation are more consistent with a localized ocular condition rather than a systemic vasculitis.

Administering an intravitreal injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent may be considered in certain retinal diseases with macular edema or neovascularization. However, without further diagnostic information, it would be premature to proceed with this treatment option. Therefore, obtaining optical coherence tomography (OCT) would be the most appropriate next step for further evaluation and management.

B: Emergent angiography

Explanation: Emergent angiography should be the next step in evaluating this patient with acute postoperative visual loss after a middle cerebral artery aneurysm clipping. The presentation of vision loss, ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and orbital signs suggests the possibility of an acute ischemic optic neuropathy or central retinal artery occlusion. Angiography can help identify any vascular abnormalities or occlusions that may be contributing to the visual loss and ophthalmoplegia. It is important to rule out any vascular causes that may require immediate intervention. Surgical re-exploration may be considered if there is evidence of a surgical complication, but this should be guided by the findings of the angiography. Immediate anticoagulation may be considered, but it is not the initial recommended step. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis is typically performed for acute orbital compartment syndrome, but this patient's presentation does not suggest this diagnosis.
API request failed on attempt 1. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
Answer: D: Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis.

Explanation: The patient presents with acute postoperative visual loss, ophthalmoplegia, and signs of orbital congestion. These findings suggest the presence of acute orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), a potential complication of orbital surgery. OCS results from increased intraorbital pressure, which can compress the optic nerve, leading to visual loss.

Immediate decompression of the orbit is crucial in cases of suspected OCS. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are simple procedures that can quickly relieve pressure and improve tissue perfusion. By releasing the lateral canthal tendon, the eye is allowed to move forward and alleviate orbital congestion.

Surgical re-exploration (A) may be warranted if there is evidence of ongoing hemorrhage or complications related to the aneurysm clipping, but in this case, the symptoms are more consistent with OCS.

Emergent angiography (B) may be indicated if there is suspicion of vascular compromise, but the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of this.

Immediate anticoagulation (C) is not appropriate in this situation because there is no indication of a thrombotic event or clot formation.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be lateral canthotomy and cantholysis (D) to relieve the orbital pressure and alleviate the acute postoperative visual loss.

B: Emergent angiography

Explanation: The patient presents with acute postoperative visual loss and ophthalmoplegia, which could be indicative of an ischemic event or vascular compromise. Emergent angiography would allow for visualization of the blood vessels supplying the eye and surrounding structures, helping to identify any vascular abnormalities or occlusions that may be causing the symptoms. This would provide important diagnostic information and guide further management options.

C: Dermoid cyst

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the newborn's chest mass is a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are congenital lesions that can occur anywhere in the body. They are typically benign and usually present as round, mobile masses. Dermoid cysts are often firm and may have a non-homogeneous or smooth texture. In this case, the absence of discoloration of the overlying skin and the normal results of the remainder of the physical examination suggest a benign condition. 

Infantile hemangioma is a common vascular tumor that usually appears after birth and grows rapidly in the first months of life. It is not typically described as firm or with a non-homogeneous or smooth texture unless complicated by ulceration or bleeding. Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor that usually arises from adrenal tissue and presents with a palpable mass, but it is unlikely to be present on the first day of life. Infantile myofibroma is a rare benign tumor that occurs more commonly in infants and young children, but it is usually firm and can have a non-homogeneous texture, similar to the presentation in this case. However, dermoid cyst is a more common and likely diagnosis based on the given information.

Answer: B: Sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis 

Explanation: The presentation of an 85-year-old man with a history of occupational exposure to asbestos, along with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and lack of bowel function, is consistent with sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis, also known as abdominal cocoon syndrome. This condition is characterized by the formation of fibrous tissue encasing the small bowel, leading to intestinal obstruction. The computed tomography scan showed dilated small intestines with air-fluid levels and the presence of adhesive bands, which are typical findings in sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis. The intraoperative finding of a tightly coiled and twisted bowel segment further supports this diagnosis. Other options such as peritoneal mesothelioma, malrotation with Ladd bands, and peritoneal encapsulation are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case.

The correct diagnosis in this case is B: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

Explanation: 
Based on the clinical presentation, the presence of a large, complex, septated abdominal mass, and the patient's history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and weight loss, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are rare mesenchymal tumors that can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. They can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. On physical examination, the patient had multiple cutaneous nodules, which can be associated with GISTs due to the release of growth factors by the tumor.

Other options:
A: Carcinoid tumor: Carcinoid tumors can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding and weight loss, but they typically present with symptoms such as flushing and diarrhea, which were not present in this case.
C: Neurofibroma: Neurofibromas are typically painless and arise from peripheral nerves. They are not typically associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.
D: Intra-abdominal abscess: Although an abscess can present with nonspecific symptoms and a mass on imaging, it is less likely given the absence of abdominal pain, fever, and other signs of infection in this case.

1413
Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and the urine culture reveals a significant bacterial growth (more than 100,000 CFUs) of Escherichia coli. This, along with the presence of foul-smelling urine, suggests an active infection. The symptoms reported by the family, such as not looking right and complaints of voiding frequently, are consistent with UTI. However, it is important to note that the nursing staff does not report confusion in this case. Therefore, the patient has another UTI based on her clinical history and the positive urine culture results.
B: Perform a lumbar puncture.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of facial droop, left leg weakness, and cystic brain lesions is concerning for central nervous system (CNS) infection or inflammation. Performing a lumbar puncture will help to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis, including cell count, protein, glucose levels, and CSF cultures. This will help to evaluate for the presence of infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, and guide further management. Additionally, CSF analysis can help to rule out other causes such as autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndromes.

B: Perform a lumbar puncture.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of facial droop, left-sided weakness, and cystic brain lesions raises concerns for a possible central nervous system (CNS) infection. Given the patient's history of vacationing in upstate New York and negative testing for common infectious causes (toxoplasma, Lyme disease, cryptococcal antigen, and human immunodeficiency virus), further evaluation is warranted.

Performing a lumbar puncture is important to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and analyze it for signs of infection, such as white blood cell count, protein level, glucose level, and presence of organisms. The CSF analysis can help differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes of his symptoms.

Starting antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole) empirically is appropriate but should be done after obtaining CSF for analysis. Consulting neurosurgery for a biopsy is premature at this point, as additional diagnostic information can be obtained through the lumbar puncture. Systemic corticosteroids are not indicated based on the information provided.

I would choose option C: Consult neurosurgery for biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of left facial droop and left leg weakness, along with the presence of cystic brain lesions on MRI, raises concern for a space-occupying lesion in the brain. To establish a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment, a biopsy of the brain lesion is warranted. Neurosurgery consultation will help determine the feasibility and appropriate approach for the biopsy procedure. Lumbar puncture may be considered if there is suspicion for an infectious cause, but in this case, the negative testing for toxoplasma, Lyme disease, cryptococcal antigen, and HIV make an infectious etiology less likely. Systemic corticosteroids would not be appropriate prior to establishing a diagnosis.

Max retry attempts reached for question 1415. Skipping this question.
B: Prescribe topical steroids.

Explanation: Based on the description and physical examination findings, the patient likely has cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), also known as "creeping eruption." CLM is a parasitic skin infection caused by the larvae of certain nematode parasites, most commonly the dog or cat hookworms. It is acquired by walking barefoot on soil or sand contaminated with animal feces containing the parasite larvae.

Topical steroids, such as hydrocortisone cream, can help relieve the intense itching and inflammation associated with CLM. While the infection will typically resolve on its own within a few weeks, treatment with topical steroids can provide symptomatic relief and accelerate healing.

Oral anthelmintic therapy (C) is reserved for severe or refractory cases of CLM, as it is usually self-limiting. Oral antibiotics (D) would not be effective against CLM, as it is caused by a parasitic infection rather than a bacterial infection. Doing nothing (A) may result in prolonged symptoms and itching for the patient.

Answer: C: The patient does not have LTBI. No further evaluation is needed.

Explanation: The patient's blood test results show a negative interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for tuberculosis (TB) infection. The nil value is less than 8 IU/mL, the TB antigen minus nil response is less than 0.35 IU/mL and 25% of the nil value, and there is a positive mitogen response. These criteria indicate that the patient does not have latent TB infection (LTBI). No further evaluation for active TB disease is needed at this time.

The diagnosis is D: Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.

Explanation: Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the subcutaneous tissue. It typically presents as rapidly enlarging nodules or plaques, which can be tender. In this case, the patient has multiple lesions on the calf, thigh, and cheek. Laboratory findings may show an elevated LDH level, as seen in this patient. The histopathologic images from the punch biopsy specimens demonstrate angiocentrism, with atypical lymphoid cells infiltrating vessels, which is characteristic of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, the positive EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) in situ hybridization confirms the presence of EBV in the atypical lymphocytic infiltrate. Other possible diagnoses, such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type), and blastomycosis, do not align with the clinical and histopathologic findings described in the case.

The correct answer is A: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Explanation: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of telangiectasias in various body sites. These telangiectasias are small, dilated blood vessels that can appear as speckled red lesions on the skin. They commonly affect the face, lips, oral mucosa, and fingertips, but can also be found on the arms, legs, and feet as seen in this case.

The lack of associated symptoms, such as tenderness, pruritus, and edema, is consistent with HHT. The absence of conjunctival or mucosal involvement further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the histologic findings of dilated, ectatic vessels in the superficial dermis with no inflammation or fibrinoid necrosis are typical of HHT.

Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (B) is a rare disorder characterized by persistent dilated, tortuous superficial blood vessels associated with dermal fibrosis. Generalized essential telangiectasia (C) is a benign condition characterized by widespread development of telangiectasias without other signs or symptoms. Systemic lupus erythematosus (D) is an autoimmune disease that can present with cutaneous manifestations including erythema, malar rash, and photosensitivity, but it is not typically associated with widespread telangiectasias.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (A).

The diagnosis is B: Hailey-Hailey disease.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of tender, reddish brown, slightly pruritic papules and plaques in the intertriginous regions (including the inframammary region and perineum) is consistent with Hailey-Hailey disease, which is also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus. This condition is caused by a mutation in the ATP2C1 gene, leading to impaired calcium ion transport in the epidermis. The resulting acantholysis leads to the formation of erosive plaques. The failure of previous treatments, including antifungals, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, suggests a non-infectious etiology. Pathologic evaluation shows abundant atypical cells within the epidermis and papillary dermis, which is consistent with Hailey-Hailey disease.

B: Neuroimaging of brain and orbits

Explanation: Bilateral neuroretinitis with retinal hemorrhages is a rare finding and can be associated with a variety of systemic conditions, including infectious and inflammatory diseases. In this case, the presence of perivascular sheathing and extensive retinal hemorrhages raises concern for a central nervous system (CNS) process, such as optic neuritis or increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain neuroimaging of the brain and orbits to evaluate for any CNS abnormalities or signs of inflammation/infection. This can help differentiate between various etiologies and guide further management.

The correct answer is D: Nevus sebaceous.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of numerous grouped translucent papules, along with the histologic findings of dilated thin-walled vascular spaces containing valvelike papillary projections in the superficial dermis, suggests the diagnosis of nevus sebaceous. Nevus sebaceous is a benign cutaneous hamartoma that typically presents at birth or in early childhood as a yellow-orange plaque or papule, which may have a pebbly or velvety surface. It commonly occurs on the scalp, face, or neck and may be associated with other cutaneous or systemic abnormalities. Nevus sebaceous may undergo a variety of changes over time, including the development of hair follicle tumors, sebaceous adenomas or carcinomas, and basal cell carcinomas. Treatment of nevus sebaceous typically involves observation for cosmetic concerns and monitoring for any potential malignant transformation. Surgical excision is often performed if there is suspicion of malignancy or significant cosmetic concerns.

The answer option is C: Peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Explanation: Based on the information provided, the patient's high-resolution computed tomography revealed a duodenal mass involving the pancreatic head, along with multiple nodules along the peritoneal reflection of the right paracolic gutter. These findings are consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis, which refers to the spread of cancer to the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. The patient's elevated liver function tests and jaundice also suggest involvement of the biliary system, which is commonly seen in cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Dropped gallstones, lymphoma, and peritoneal mesothelioma are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

The answer is A: Desmoid fibromatosis.

Explanation: The patient presented with a tender, firm flank mass that was mobile but fixed to the abdominal wall musculature. The mass was initially identified on ultrasonography and further characterized on MRI. Ultrasonography-guided core biopsy showed a myofibroblastic proliferation. These findings are consistent with desmoid fibromatosis, which is a locally aggressive fibroblastic tumor that typically presents as a firm, non-mobile mass that is often associated with trauma or pregnancy.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (Option B) typically presents as a mass with a combination of inflammatory cells and myofibroblastic spindle cells. However, the immunostaining in this case was negative for S100 and desmin, making inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor less likely.

Nodular fasciitis (Option C) is a benign reactive myofibroblastic proliferation that typically presents as a rapidly growing, well-circumscribed mass. The clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case are not consistent with nodular fasciitis.

Leiomyosarcoma (Option D) is a malignant tumor composed of smooth muscle cells. The imaging findings and biopsy results described in the case are not consistent with leiomyosarcoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is A: Desmoid fibromatosis.

The clinical presentation of numerous flesh-colored to translucent papules on the palms and palmar and lateral aspects of the fingers, with central depression in some, along with similar lesions on the margins of the feet, particularly the great toes, and hyperkeratotic yellow plaques with scattered pits in areas of pressure on the soles, is consistent with the diagnosis of hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (HPTA). HPTA is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by asymptomatic translucent papules on the palms and soles, typically starting in the 30s or 40s. The lesions are often exacerbated by exposure to water and alcohol-based substances. The histologic findings of vertical thinning of the epidermis, loss of the granular layer, mild basal hyperpigmentation, and varying degrees of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate support the diagnosis. Dyshidrotic pemphigoid (B) is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that typically presents with vesicles and bullae predominantly on the hands and feet. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (C) is a hereditary disorder characterized by blistering and fragility of the skin. Dyshidrotic eczema (D) is a common episodic form of hand eczema that presents with pruritic vesicles on the palms, lateral fingers, and soles.

The answer is: D: Perivulvar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the fever, periorbital swelling, and painful perivulvar eruption, along with the histopathologic findings of spongiosis and hyperplasia of the epidermis with neutrophilic infiltrate and necrotic collagen and eccrine gland destruction, are consistent with perivulvar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (PNEH). PNEH is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that typically occurs in patients receiving chemotherapy, particularly cytarabine. The characteristic perivulvar plaques and nodules, as well as the associated systemic symptoms, help differentiate PNEH from other conditions such as Sweet syndrome, herpes genitalis, and deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection.

The Diagnosis is: D: Cutaneous graft-vs-host disease.

Explanation: Cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a potential complication of bone marrow transplantation. It typically occurs within the first few months to years after transplantation and is characterized by a donor T-cell-mediated attack on recipient tissues. Cutaneous GVHD presents with various clinical manifestations, including erythematous macules, papules, and plaques. The lesions are usually widespread and may be pruritic. In chronic GVHD, as seen in this case, hyperkeratotic papules and plaques with well-demarcated keratotic margins can develop.

The diagnosis is C: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a pruritic, reticulated bullous eruption in a healthy young man, along with the biopsy findings of dense eosinophilic infiltration, necrosis of the epidermis, and intraepidermal blister containing neutrophils and eosinophils, is consistent with Linear IgA bullous dermatosis. This autoimmune blistering disorder is characterized by the deposition of linear IgA along the basement membrane zone.

Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis typically presents with hyperpigmented papules that coalesce into plaques, but there are no bullae or erosions seen in this case.

Bullous prurigo pigmentosa is a rare inflammatory dermatosis characterized by pruritic papules that progress to form bullae. However, it usually occurs in patients with a ketogenic diet-induced ketosis, which the patient denied having in this case.

Lichen planus pigmentosus is a variant of lichen planus characterized by hyperpigmented macules, but it does not present with bullae or erosions, and the histopathology findings described do not match.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

D: Determine Epstein-Barr virus status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and long-term methotrexate use, it is important to determine the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status. Methotrexate is known to increase the risk of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Additionally, EBV-negative DLBCL has a more favorable prognosis compared to EBV-positive DLBCL.

Based on the case history and findings, it would be prudent to first determine the EBV status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy. Radiation and/or chemotherapy, initiation of rituximab, or excision of the eyelid lesion may be considered as treatment options depending on the EBV status and further evaluation of the patient's condition.

1432
I would choose option D: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.

Explanation: In this case, the patient has an intractable choroidal effusion with exudative retinal detachment. Given that the patient did not respond to conservative management, treatment with anti-VEGF therapy would be the appropriate next step.

Anti-VEGF therapy, such as intravitreal injections of drugs like bevacizumab or ranibizumab, can help to reduce leakage from the choroid and improve retinal detachment in cases of exudative retinal detachment associated with choroidal effusion. This treatment is commonly used in cases of choroidal neovascularization, which can also cause exudative retinal detachment.

Drainage of the choroidal effusion may be considered if it is causing significant symptoms or is associated with complications such as retinal detachment, but in this case, the patient has already undergone surgical procedures and management without resolution.

Oral steroids and oral propranolol are not typically indicated in the treatment of choroidal effusion with exudative retinal detachment in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Steroids can have systemic side effects and may worsen glaucoma in this patient population, while propranolol is primarily used for the treatment of infantile hemangioma and would not directly address the underlying issue of choroidal effusion.

The correct answer is B: Incontinentia pigmenti.

Explanation: Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare X-linked dominant disorder that primarily affects females, although males can be affected in severe cases. It is characterized by skin abnormalities such as linear bands or sworls of vesicles or papules, which can be present at birth and persist throughout a person's life. The lesions typically follow a Blaschkoid pattern, which is a streak-like distribution along the lines of skin embryogenesis. In addition to skin findings, other associated features can include abnormalities in the teeth, hair, nails, and eyes, as well as neurologic and developmental issues.

Varicella-zoster virus (A) causes chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster). The presentation described in the case does not match the typical vesicular rash distribution seen with varicella or herpes zoster.

Herpes simplex virus (C) typically presents with grouped vesicles on an erythematous base, rather than the linear band or whorled configuration described in the case.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (D) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells in various organs. It does not typically present with the skin findings described in the case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Incontinentia pigmenti (B).

The correct answer is C: Small-bowel volvulus.

Explanation: Based on the patient's history of recurring vomiting and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of a distended and tender abdomen on the right side of the paraumbilical point, and the abdominal CT scan showing a mass in the same location, the most likely diagnosis is small-bowel volvulus.

Small-bowel volvulus occurs when a segment of the small intestine twists around its mesenteric axis, causing obstruction of the blood supply and intestinal lumen. This can result in acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension. The presence of an abdominal mass is a characteristic finding in small-bowel volvulus.

Intussusception involves one portion of the intestine telescoping into another, leading to obstruction. It typically occurs in children and has different clinical presentations and imaging findings than those described in the case.

Colon cancer is unlikely in this case since the abdominal mass is located on the right side of the paraumbilical point, which is not a typical site for colon cancer.

Mesenteric ischemia refers to a decrease in blood flow to the intestines due to a blockage or narrowing of the mesenteric arteries. It presents with severe abdominal pain, often out of proportion to physical examination findings, and typically occurs in older patients with risk factors such as atherosclerosis. The CT scan in this case does not show the characteristic findings of mesenteric ischemia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is small-bowel volvulus.

B: Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement

Explanation: Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement would be the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's presentation with a large hernia defect containing abdominal contents necessitates surgical intervention. The transabdominal laparoscopic approach allows for reduction of the herniated contents and repair of the hernia defect using mesh reinforcement. This minimally invasive approach offers advantages such as shorter recovery time, reduced postoperative pain, and lower risk of complications compared to open surgery options like thoracotomy.

The correct answer is C: Retroperitoneal abscess.

Explanation:
Given the patient's symptoms of intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation, along with the finding of a large retroperitoneal mass on computed tomography, the most likely diagnosis is a retroperitoneal abscess. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis B and recent liver biopsy suggest a possible source of infection. The absence of palpable masses on physical examination and normal laboratory test results support this diagnosis. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas and endothelial adrenal cyst are less likely due to the location and presentation of the mass. Pheochromocytoma would typically present with hypertension and other associated symptoms, which are not described in this case.

B: Consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding; obtain a dermatology consultation and refer the patient to interventional radiology.

Explanation: The presence of multiple red papules on the tongue, trunk, and limbs in a patient with an acute onset of headache, hemiparesis, and fever suggests the possibility of embolic phenomena. The ring-enhanced lesion with surrounding edema on the brain CT indicates a possible cerebral abscess. Therefore, consulting a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding is necessary. Additionally, obtaining a dermatology consultation can help evaluate the papules on the tongue and other parts of the body for a possible underlying pathology. Referring the patient to interventional radiology can help further investigate and assess any additional lesions or abnormalities.

B: Obtain a skin punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of stem cell transplantation and the clinical presentation of a nonpruritic rash with associated systemic symptoms, there is a suspicion of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, additional diagnostic tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. A skin punch biopsy can provide histopathological evidence of GVHD, such as epidermal apoptosis, basal layer vacuolization, and lymphocytic infiltrates. This will help differentiate GVHD from other possible causes, such as drug reactions or infection.

B: Treat with oral corticosteroids

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, along with the presence of small yellow-white retinal lesions and hyperfluorescent lesions on fluorescein angiogram, suggest a diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is an inflammatory condition that primarily affects the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium. Treatment with oral corticosteroids is the mainstay of therapy for APMPPE, aiming to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the retina.

The diagnosis is C: Coccidioidomycosis.

Explanation: Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is a fungal infection caused by the inhalation of spores from the Coccidioides species. It is endemic to certain areas of the southwestern United States, including southern California. The presentation of bilateral violaceous cervical adenopathy, along with the history of living in an endemic area and the presence of bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest radiograph, is highly suggestive of coccidioidomycosis. The histological examination of the lymph node biopsy showing multiple spherules containing endospores further supports this diagnosis. Tuberculosis would typically present with granulomas on histological examination. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection would require acid-fast staining for definitive diagnosis. Lymphoma would typically present with lymphadenopathy that is not associated with respiratory symptoms or chest radiographic findings.

The diagnosis for the young woman with massive splenomegaly is D: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Explanation: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, which includes lymph nodes, spleen, and other immune cells. Massive splenomegaly, along with other symptoms such as rash, fatigue, early satiety, and back pain, are consistent with the presentation of lymphoma. The absence of constitutional symptoms like fevers, night sweats, chills, arthralgias, or weight loss, as well as the negative hematologic workup, makes other options less likely. Cross-sectional imaging, which is not described in the case, would be required to definitively diagnose lymphoma.

Answer: C: Catheterization of left anomalous pulmonary vein

Explanation: The case describes a patient who had a triple-lumen central catheter placed in the left internal jugular vein, but on postprocedure radiography, the tip of the catheter was not in the expected location. The correct diagnosis is catheterization of the left anomalous pulmonary vein. This is suggested by the abnormal position of the catheter tip seen on imaging. Anomalous pulmonary veins are veins that do not follow the normal anatomical pathway and can lead to misplacement of central catheters. In this case, the catheter likely entered the left anomalous pulmonary vein instead of the intended left internal jugular vein.

D: Prescribe oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy.

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical findings are consistent with recurrent erythema multiforme, which is known to be associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to prescribe oral prednisone to control the skin lesions and HSV viral suppression therapy to reduce the frequency and severity of recurrences. Serum cryoglobulin level, intradermal progesterone challenge, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir are not indicated based on the information provided.

D: Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination.

Explanation: In cases where there is a painless plaque with erosions on the scrotum, a biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis. This will allow for further examination of the tissue to determine the underlying cause of the plaque. The other options mentioned, such as treating with a topical steroid or initiating treatment with valacyclovir, are not appropriate until a definitive diagnosis is made. Additionally, ordering laboratory studies to rule out syphilis may be considered, but obtaining a biopsy takes precedence in this case.

Answer: B: Primary aldosteronism is suggested; imaging is required for confirmation.

Explanation: Based on the test results, the patient has an elevated plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) of 32 ng/dL and a suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) of <0.3 ng/mL/hr. This combination is suggestive of primary aldosteronism. However, further confirmation is required through imaging studies to identify the underlying cause. Imaging can help determine whether the primary aldosteronism is due to an adrenal adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia, or another cause. Additional tests such as an aldosterone suppression test may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

D: Order serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae. 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of MS and previous optic neuritis episodes, as well as the presence of visual symptoms, it is important to consider other potential causes for the current presentation. Bartonella henselae is a bacterial infection that can cause various ocular manifestations, including neuroretinitis, which presents with optic disc edema and multiple yellow-white retinal lesions. Ordering serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae can help confirm or rule out this infection as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms.

The correct answer is B: Rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including progressive proptosis, eyelid swelling, and pain with ocular movement, along with the imaging findings of severe right proptosis and thickening of the rectus muscles and soft tissues, are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles. The presence of inflammation involving the intraconal fat and perineural soft tissues seen on MRI further supports this diagnosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that commonly occurs in children and adolescents, and affects the skeletal muscle. In this case, it has involved the extraocular muscles, resulting in the presenting symptoms. Prompt biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

The answer is B: Ileal intussusception.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the palpable mass in the lower right abdominal quadrant, are suggestive of intussusception. Intussusception occurs when one segment of the intestine telescopes into another, resulting in a bowel obstruction. In this case, the ileum is telescoping into the cecum. The imaging findings on abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography support this diagnosis. The presence of a bulge in the cecal lumen during colonoscopy further confirms the diagnosis. Appendiceal abscess, cecal volvulus, and appendiceal intussusception are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings.

1452
The diagnosis is C: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

Explanation: The imaging findings, as described in the case, along with the histopathological and immunohistochemical staining results, suggest a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNSTs are rare soft tissue tumors that can arise from peripheral nerves and demonstrate heterogenous enhancement on imaging. The presence of spindle cells, positive staining for desmin and smooth muscle actin, as well as focal positivity for pan-keratin and S100, support the diagnosis of MPNST. The negative staining for CD34 and CDK4, along with the absence of MDM2 gene amplification on fluorescence in situ hybridization, further support the diagnosis of MPNST rather than other sarcoma subtypes such as liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. The patient's family history of neurofibromatosis 1 may provide additional clues, as MPNSTs can arise in individuals with this genetic condition.

The diagnosis is D: Bacterial abscess.

Explanation: The presentation of a rapidly growing mass with associated pain, pus drainage, weight loss, and surrounding erythema is suggestive of an abscess. The imaging findings on the computed tomography scan, showing a large soft-tissue mass invading the liver and extending through intercostal spaces, further support this diagnosis. The presence of multiple pustules on physical examination also indicates an infectious process. Core needle biopsy was inconclusive, likely due to sampling error, and therefore, a fresh tissue biopsy was recommended. The excisional biopsy performed in the operating room confirmed the diagnosis of a bacterial abscess.

Answer: B

Explanation: The test results indicate that the patient has a positive anti-HCV result, indicating the presence of hepatitis C antibodies. However, the additional tests for liver damage, such as aminotransferase levels and other liver function tests, are within normal ranges. This suggests that the patient may have been infected with HCV in the past but is no longer actively infected, as indicated by the lack of liver damage and normal liver function markers.
B: Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation of acute left shoulder pain, left-sided chest pain, and shortness of breath, along with the findings on chest radiography of left lower lobe opacification, further evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is warranted. A CT scan will provide more detailed imaging and help identify the underlying cause of the lung opacification, such as infection, tumor, or other pathology. This will help guide subsequent management and treatment options. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and an infectious workup including blood tests and sputum culture can be considered depending on the results of the CT scan. Initial treatment with oral antibiotics is not recommended without a definitive diagnosis and should be guided by the underlying cause identified on imaging.

B: Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the findings on chest radiography suggest that there is opacification of the left lower lobe of the lung. To further evaluate this opacification, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest should be performed. This will provide more detailed information about the extent, location, and characteristics of the opacification, which can help determine the underlying cause.

C: Perform a punch biopsy of the lesion

Explanation: The description of a gradually increasing size, becoming indented, and tender suggests potential malignancy or an infectious process. A punch biopsy would provide histopathologic examination, which can help differentiate between these possibilities and guide further management. Radiograph, antinuclear antibody levels, and blood cultures are not indicated in this case as they are not directly relevant to the evaluation of a hyperpigmented lesion. Empirical antibiotics would be premature without a confirmed diagnosis.

The bone marrow biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis of polycythemia vera and also assess for any progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. In addition, it can provide important information about the patient's anemia and the cause of the left upper quadrant pain. Splenomegaly in polycythemia vera can be associated with complications such as splenic infarction, which can cause pain. Therefore, obtaining a bone marrow biopsy would help guide further management in this patient.

The answer is D: Prescribe lubrication with autologous serum tears.

Explanation: The patient presents with bilateral corneal thinning, neurotrophic ulcers, and anterior uveitis with hypopyon. These findings are consistent with neurotrophic keratitis, which is caused by decreased corneal sensitivity and reduced tear production. Given the patient's decreased corneal sensation and the fact that Schirmer testing showed reduced tear production, the initial management should focus on addressing the underlying neurotrophic keratitis by promoting corneal healing and providing lubrication.

Prescribing lubrication with autologous serum tears is the most appropriate option in this case. Autologous serum tears contain growth factors and other components that help promote corneal healing. Lubrication with these tears can provide the necessary moisture, support corneal epithelial healing, and alleviate symptoms of dryness and blurry vision.

Options A (Prescribe oral prednisone), B (Place bandage contact lenses), and C (Perform tarsorrhaphy) are not appropriate as initial management options in this case. Oral prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that may have potential side effects and is not indicated as the first-line treatment for neurotrophic keratitis. Bandage contact lenses and tarsorrhaphy are considered as additional treatment options in cases where conservative measures fail to improve corneal healing.

The answer option is D: Surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis.

Explanation: Given the presence of a unique oval-shaped lesion in the right eye that changes location with head posture, along with the absence of other symptoms and unremarkable findings from a dilated fundus examination, it is important to further investigate and remove the cyst for pathological analysis. This will help determine the nature of the lesion and guide appropriate treatment, if necessary. Other diagnostic tests such as computerized tomographic scan or anterior segment tomography may provide additional information but are not necessary as a first step before surgical removal of the cyst. Systemic treatment with albendazole is typically used for parasitic infections and is not indicated based on the provided information.

Answer: C: Lyme disease

Explanation: The presence of pink-violaceous nummular and annular patches on the trunk, buttocks, and thighs, along with a recent history of fever, headache, fatigue, and living in a heavily wooded area, are consistent with the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks. The characteristic rash seen in Lyme disease is called erythema migrans, which often appears as a pink or red circular rash that expands over time. The rash can be accompanied by flu-like symptoms. In this case, the girl's recent history of fever and headache, along with the rash, are highly suggestive of Lyme disease. It is important to note that the patient did not recall a tick bite, which is not uncommon, as many tick bites go unnoticed. Confirmation of the diagnosis is typically done through laboratory testing, such as Lyme serology. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease is important to prevent further complications.

The correct answer is D: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

Explanation: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They can arise anywhere along the GI tract, but most commonly occur in the stomach and small intestine. GISTs typically have an indolent course, but can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

In this case, the patient presented with several months of upper abdominal pain, morning nausea, and worsening of symptoms with food and alcohol intake. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the midabdomen with localized discomfort. Imaging studies showed a hypervascular soft tissue mass in the mesentery, and a subsequent laparotomy revealed a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass in the mesentery.

The pathologic photomicrograph of the specimen showed characteristic features of a GIST. These include spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicular or whorled patterns, and immunohistochemical staining positive for CD117 (c-kit), which is a specific marker for GISTs.

Therefore, the diagnosis in this case is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), indicated by the presence of a hypervascular soft tissue mass in the mesentery and the characteristic histopathologic findings.

The diagnosis in this case is:
B: Mesenteric hematoma

Explanation: The computed tomography findings of a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis, along with the presence of a hematoma in the left midabdomen, are consistent with a mesenteric hematoma. This can occur due to bleeding from injury to the mesenteric vessels during the motor vehicle collision. The patient's symptoms of diffuse lower abdominal pain and distended, tender abdomen further support the diagnosis. Other options such as duodenal injury, avulsed uterine fibroid, and right gonadal vein injury would have different clinical and imaging findings.

1463
The diagnosis is B: Ileocolic intussusception.

Explanation: Intussusception occurs when a segment of the intestine folds into itself, causing an obstruction. In this case, the patient's symptoms of colicky lower abdominal pain, constipation, and passage of a small bloody bowel movement, along with the physical examination findings of a soft, nontender abdomen without palpable masses, are suggestive of bowel obstruction.

The imaging from her initial presentation 11 months prior, as shown in the computed tomography images, demonstrates the presence of intussusception. This finding supports the diagnosis of ileocolic intussusception, where the ileum telescopes into the colon.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome, which the patient also has, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple polyps in the digestive tract, including the colon, stomach, and duodenum. While these polyps may be a contributing factor to the patient's recurrent small-bowel obstructions, the primary cause in this case is ileocolic intussusception.

I would choose option D: Perform an extended drug screen.

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation, including the reduced level of consciousness, trismus, scalp hematoma, and the presence of unusual skin lesions, it is important to consider toxicological causes for his condition. The severe lactic acidosis and elevated creatinine kinase level are also concerning and may be indicative of drug toxicity. Therefore, performing an extended drug screen would help identify any potential substances that may have contributed to the patient's symptoms. This would allow for appropriate management and treatment.

Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The physical examination findings of bibasilar lung field crackles and diminished breath sounds, as well as the portable chest x-ray showing pulmonary edema, support the diagnosis. The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level also suggests CHF. Loop diuretics are the first-line treatment for CHF to reduce fluid overload and alleviate symptoms. Therefore, the appropriate management for this patient is to initiate a loop diuretic.
B: Prescribe topical interferon drops followed by excisional biopsy 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a rapidly enlarging, painful, and red eye mass with inability to close the eye is concerning for an aggressive tumor, such as conjunctival melanoma. Therefore, prompt intervention is necessary. The initial step would be to prescribe topical interferon drops, which have been shown to be effective in treating ocular surface squamous neoplasia (a potential differential diagnosis). If there is no response to the interferon drops, an excisional biopsy should be performed to obtain a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Enucleation (D) would only be recommended if the tumor is confirmed to be invasive and threatening sight or spreading beyond the eye.

C: Obtain serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis

Explanation: In a healthy 4-year-old girl with a white pupil, one of the potential causes is Toxocara canis infection. Toxocara canis is a parasitic infection that can cause ocular larva migrans and result in a white pupillary reflex. To confirm the diagnosis, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) should be performed to detect specific antibodies against the parasite. This will help differentiate it from other possible causes and guide appropriate treatment. Therefore, obtaining a serum ELISA for Toxocara canis is the most appropriate next step in this case.

The correct answer is B: Cecal inflammation with abscess.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of nausea and low-grade fever, along with the findings on the computed tomographic (CT) scan, point towards the diagnosis of cecal inflammation with abscess. The presence of gas-containing phlegmon and the stent in the common iliac artery suggest an infection or abscess related to the procedure done by the interventional cardiologist. This is a rare but serious complication known as iatrogenic cecal or colonic perforation. Immediate surgical intervention is required to drain the abscess and repair the perforation. The other answer choices (ruptured acute appendicitis, iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis, and hematoma) are not supported by the clinical history or CT findings in this case.

The diagnosis for this case is A: Acute appendicitis.

Explanation: The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting, with increasing intensity and constant pain. Focal tenderness to palpation was noted during examination. Imaging (CT scan and ultrasonography) was inconclusive, but an abnormal-appearing cecum was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a suspicious structure within the cecum. Given these findings and symptoms, laparoscopic exploration was performed, leading to the identification of the need for ileocecectomy. The histologic analysis of the resected appendix showed positive progesterone receptor immunostaining. 

Postoperatively, the patient developed an abscess near the ileocolic anastomosis, which was successfully treated with percutaneous drain placement. Later, the patient experienced spotting and cramping, leading to the diagnosis of intrauterine fetal demise and requiring emergency dilation and curettage.

D: Refer the patient to an oral surgeon for evaluation and full-mouth dental x-rays.

Explanation: The presence of a slowly enlarging growth in the mouth, along with the appearance of prominent protuberances at the bilateral maxillary tuberosities, warrants further evaluation by an oral surgeon. While the physical examination findings may suggest a benign condition, such as torus palatinus or exostosis, it is important to rule out any potential underlying pathology. Additional evaluation with full-mouth dental x-rays and a computed tomography scan of the head may be necessary to assess the extent of the lesions and determine the appropriate management plan. Performing a biopsy of the lesion is premature at this stage and should be considered after a thorough evaluation by a specialist.

B: Recommend punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate.

Explanation: Given the history of progressive enlargement and darkening of the pigmented band on the nail plate, a punch biopsy of the nail bed through the intact nail plate would provide a definitive diagnosis and help rule out any malignant or potentially harmful conditions such as nail melanoma. This allows for a histopathological examination of the tissues involved. Other options such as reassurance or sending clippings for histopathology may not provide a conclusive diagnosis or may miss the underlying cause of the pigmentation.

B: Check for hypertension

Explanation: The presentation of cotton-wool spots and retinal hemorrhages in this patient with a history of cirrhosis and anemia suggests that the blurred vision may be due to hypertensive retinopathy. Hypertension is a common comorbidity seen in patients with cirrhosis and can lead to retinal vascular changes. Checking the patient's blood pressure will help to confirm if hypertension is a contributing factor to the visual symptoms. Additionally, controlling hypertension is important for the overall management of the patient's health.

C: Scabies

Explanation: Based on the history of the patient's father working in a nursing home with a recent outbreak of scabies and the treatment with permethrin cream, the presence of numerous erythematous papules, pustules, and lesions in a linear array on the back, as well as the fading papules on the abdomen, are highly suggestive of scabies infestation. Scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and commonly presents with intensely pruritic papules, pustules, and burrows in the affected areas. The delayed response to treatment in this case is not uncommon and may require additional treatment or further evaluation.

The diagnosis is B: Angioleiomyoma.

Explanation:
The clinical and histological features described in the case suggest the presence of an angioleiomyoma. Angioleiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumors that arise from the tunica media of blood vessels. They most commonly occur in the uterus and skin, but can also be found in other locations, such as the gastrointestinal tract. In this case, the lesion is located adjacent to the pancreas and surrounding the common hepatic artery.

The imaging findings, including the well-defined hypoechoic lesion and patchy arterial enhancement, are consistent with an angioleiomyoma. The surgical exploration and histological examination of the resected specimen further support this diagnosis, showing spindled cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and small vessels embedded in a fibrotic background.

The strong, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for desmin, a smooth muscle marker, also supports the diagnosis of angioleiomyoma. Staining for S100, which is commonly positive in neuroendocrine tumors, was negative in this case. Additionally, the lack of mitotic activity, cytologic atypia, or areas of necrosis further supports the benign nature of the lesion.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is angioleiomyoma (B).

The diagnosis is B: Rectal prolapse.

Explanation: In rectal prolapse, the rectum turns inside out and protrudes through the anal canal. The patient usually presents with a painless, palpable mass that can be felt and seen externally. In this case, the patient had a painful anal mass that was exteriorized through the anus. The absence of a digestive lumen inside the mass and the presence of hypoxemic rectal mucosa further support the diagnosis of rectal prolapse. Other findings, such as vomiting, absence of bowel movements, and distended abdomen, are also consistent with intestinal occlusion commonly observed in rectal prolapse.

C: Perform a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm for pathologic evaluation.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of oral ulcers accompanied by targetoid lesions on the palms is concerning for a possible autoimmune or connective tissue disorder, such as erythema multiforme (EM). EM is typically a hypersensitivity reaction that can be triggered by infections, medications, or underlying systemic diseases. To confirm the diagnosis, a skin biopsy of one of the targetoid lesions on the palm should be performed, which can help determine if the diagnosis is consistent with EM. This will help guide further management and treatment decisions for the patient.

C: Perform a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm for pathologic evaluation.

Explanation: The presence of targetoid lesions on the palms suggests a possible diagnosis of erythema multiforme (EM), which is characterized by mucocutaneous inflammation. In order to confirm the diagnosis, a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm should be performed for pathologic evaluation. This will provide definitive evidence of EM and help exclude other possible causes.

C: Obtain both bacterial culture and fungal culture of the affected areas and administer both a systemic antibiotic and a systemic antifungal agent.

Explanation: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, recent onset of skin lesions, and involvement of multiple areas, it is important to consider both bacterial and fungal infections. Obtaining cultures from both affected areas will help identify the causative organisms and guide appropriate treatment. Systemic antibiotic and antifungal therapy should be initiated to cover both possibilities while awaiting the culture results.

The diagnosis for this case is D: Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.

Explanation: The patient's history of minocycline use for acne, along with the development of cutaneous manifestations including a painful bullous skin lesion and ulcer with raised border, suggests the possibility of minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. This rare adverse effect has been reported in association with long-term minocycline use and is characterized by systemic vasculitis with involvement of small to medium-sized arteries. The patient's laboratory findings, including positive antinuclear antibody, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum IgG levels, further support this diagnosis. The other options (A: Erythema nodosum, B: Sarcoidosis, C: Systemic lupus erythematosus) do not fully explain the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings.

The diagnosis is: B: Amebic liver abscess secondary to Entamoeba histolytica infection.

Explanation: The presence of multiloculated cystic lesions in the liver, in addition to the history of abdominal pain, suggests the possibility of liver abscess. Amebic liver abscess is a common form of amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica, a parasitic infection. The atypical cells suspicious for malignancy on biopsy may be a result of inflammation rather than true malignancy. Biliary cystadenomas, metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors, and cystic hepatocellular carcinomas are less likely given the patient's history and imaging findings.

The diagnosis is B: Spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall.

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of breast cancer and radiation therapy, the first consideration would be a recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer. However, the physical examination findings and imaging results are not consistent with breast carcinoma. The mass arises from the chest wall, is well-circumscribed, and extends to the pleural surface. Additionally, there is no associated axillary lymphadenopathy. 

Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma is unlikely, as the patient's rectal cancer was treated and her follow-up imaging did not reveal any evidence of disease recurrence in the abdomen and pelvis. 

Desmoid tumor of the chest wall is also unlikely given the rapid enlargement of the mass in a short period of time, which is not characteristic of desmoid tumors. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall. This type of tumor is a rare malignant neoplasm that arises from the soft tissues, including the chest wall. Core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.

C: Perform an incisional skin biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, elevated serum lipase and amylase levels, and the appearance of new nodules with or after episodes of acute pancreatitis, it is important to rule out pancreatic panniculitis, which is a rare skin manifestation of pancreatic disease. The erythematous subcutaneous nodules and the presence of a small amount of yellow, oily discharge from one of the nodules raise concern for this condition. A skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis by showing lobular panniculitis, fat necrosis, and chronic inflammation. Other investigations such as blood cultures, computed tomography scan, and PPD skin test may be considered depending on the results of the skin biopsy.

My diagnosis is B: Erythema annulare centrifugum.

Explanation: Erythema annulare centrifugum is a type of inflammatory rash characterized by expanding annular patches that often clear in the center while maintaining a raised and erythematous border. This condition is typically associated with pruritus. The history of pruritic rash on the cheeks that failed to respond to topical corticosteroids and antifungal agents, along with the appearance of slowly expanding, hyperpigmented, ringlike lesions with central clearing and peripheral scaling and erythema on the right cheek, is consistent with erythema annulare centrifugum.

The diagnosis in this case is D: Skin amyloidosis.

Explanation: Skin amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid protein in the skin, leading to various skin manifestations. It can present with a rash, ulcerated areas, and edema. The patient's history of ischemic heart disease, familial Mediterranean fever, and arthropathy are not consistent with the other answer options. Additionally, glucagonoma, insulinoma, and VIPoma are neuroendocrine tumors that typically present with symptoms related to hormone overproduction, rather than skin manifestations.

The diagnosis is C: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (or calciphylaxis). 

Explanation: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy is a rare and severe disorder characterized by progressive ischemic cutaneous necrosis and tissue inflammation due to small-vessel calcification. It is most commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease, like the patient in the case presentation. The calcification of small blood vessels leads to impaired blood flow and oxygenation to the skin and tissues, resulting in necrosis and gangrene. Risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy include diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and the use of warfarin sodium. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, peripheral vascular disease, and warfarin use are all consistent with calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Other findings, such as elevated calcium and intact parathyroid hormone levels, further support this diagnosis. Subacute bacterial endocarditis can present with cutaneous manifestations, but the absence of relevant clinical features, such as a new heart murmur or systemic symptoms, makes this diagnosis less likely. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis typically occurs within the first few days to weeks of warfarin therapy and is characterized by painful ecchymotic or necrotic lesions. The gradual onset of skin necrosis in this case is not consistent with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Buerger disease refers to a nonatherosclerotic, inflammatory small-vessel vasculitis that most commonly affects the arteries and veins of the lower extremities. Although Buerger disease can cause ischemic limb symptoms, it does not typically present with symmetrical cutaneous necrosis involving the fingers and toes.

Answer: C: Perform angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery.

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation, presence of a bruit, and imaging findings, the patient likely has fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which is a nonatherosclerotic arterial disease. FMD can lead to renovascular hypertension and lower extremity arterial stenosis, causing exertional leg pain. Treatment for FMD involves angioplasty and stenting of the affected arteries. In this case, angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery would be appropriate to relieve the arterial obstructions and improve blood flow. Managing the patient with antihypertensive agents and a walking program (Option B) may be insufficient to address the underlying arterial disease and may not lead to significant symptomatic improvement. Administering cilostazol for claudication and continuing lisinopril for hypertension (Option D) may help with symptom management, but it would not address the underlying arterial obstructions. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery (Option C).

Answer: B: Ecthyma gangrenosum

Explanation: Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare skin infection commonly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals. The development of violaceous skin lesions with edema followed by ulceration and necrosis is characteristic of ecthyma gangrenosum. The infant's history of bronchiolitis, leukopenia with neutropenia, and the presence of a known hepatitis C virus infection in the mother further support the diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum. Prompt treatment with intravenous antibiotics and surgical debridement is required to manage the infection.

The answer is C: Internal iliac artery aneurysm. 

Explanation: The physical examination findings of a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant, along with perineal ecchymosis, suggest the presence of an aneurysm. The computed tomography images show displacement of the bladder and compression of the rectum, indicating compression of adjacent structures by the aneurysm. The patient's history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair further supports the diagnosis. Prostate cancer (option A) is unlikely since the symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with prostate cancer. Recurrent colon cancer (option B) is also less likely because the previous colon cancer was on the right side and there are no signs of acute bowel obstruction. Primary lymphoma of the urinary bladder (option D) is uncommon and would present with different symptoms, such as hematuria and urinary tract abnormalities.

The diagnosis is A: Pulmonary aspergilloma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms (productive cough, profuse hemoptysis, and intermittent breathlessness), along with the imaging findings (ground-glass opacity, ball-like mass with an air crescent sign), are highly suggestive of a pulmonary aspergilloma. Aspergilloma is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species, commonly found in patients with a history of lung disease or immunocompromised status. The presence of a cavitary lesion, central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass, and the absence of endobronchial lesions on bronchoscopy further support this diagnosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis (B) can sometimes present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, but in this case, sputum examinations for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture are negative. Squamous cell carcinoma (C) and pulmonary hydatid cyst (D) are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings mentioned in the case.

B: Initiate treatment for cerebral vasculitis with corticosteroids.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings (multiple infarctions and abnormalities suggestive of vasculitis) are indicative of cerebral vasculitis. The elevated ESR, anemia, and abnormal CSF findings further support the diagnosis. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for vasculitis, as they help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the blood vessels. Antiplatelet agents alone would not be sufficient in this case, as the underlying cause is likely vasculitis rather than atherosclerosis. Brain biopsy and skin and bone marrow biopsies may be considered at a later stage if needed, but initiating treatment with corticosteroids is the initial priority.

D: Extended workup.

Explanation: Given the presentation of yellow-white, subretinal lesions in the retina, the appropriate next step would be to conduct an extended workup to further investigate the underlying cause. The previous systemic workup was normal, suggesting that additional testing is necessary to reach a diagnosis. Possible tests could include fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography to provide further insights into the nature and extent of the lesions. Additionally, further blood tests can be considered to evaluate for infectious, autoimmune, or inflammatory disorders. This comprehensive approach will help in identifying the cause and planning appropriate management for the patient.

The answer is B: Epidermal nevus.

Explanation: Epidermal nevus is a benign skin condition that typically presents with a raised, verrucous, or papillated plaque. It is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood. In puberty, hormonal changes can cause the nevus to enlarge and become more pronounced. The clinical photograph provided shows a plaque with a verrucous texture, characteristic of an epidermal nevus. Congenital melanocytic nevus (A) presents as a pigmented lesion, while nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn (C) typically presents as a hairless, yellow-orange plaque. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (D) is a variant of epidermal nevus that primarily affects the extremities and is characterized by linear and verrucous lesions.

B: Ileocecal intussusception

Explanation: The presence of colicky abdominal pain with radiation to the right iliac fossa, associated with nausea and loose stools, suggests a possible bowel obstruction. The abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan findings of a tubular thin-walled filling defect in the cecum and lower part of the ascending colon, with the oral contrast agent seen around, proximal, and distal to the defect, are consistent with the diagnosis of intussusception. Intussusception occurs when one segment of the bowel invaginates into an adjacent segment, leading to obstruction. In this case, the intussusception involves the ileocecal region. Surgery is usually required for the treatment of intussusception.

The diagnosis is (C) Type 1 choledochal cyst.

Explanation:
The imaging results from both the abdominal magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and the computed tomography scan reveal a cystic lesion in the region of the porta hepatis. This finding is consistent with a Type 1 choledochal cyst. Choledochal cysts are congenital dilations of the biliary tract and are classified into different types based on the location and anatomical characteristics. Type 1 choledochal cysts involve a dilation of the common bile duct, with or without involvement of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Treatment typically involves surgical resection of the cyst and reconstruction of the biliary tract to prevent complications such as cholangitis, stone formation, and the development of biliary carcinoma.
B: Obtain radiographs of the mandible

The correct answer option is A: Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

Explanation: The patient's sudden-onset, painless blurred vision and visual field defect in the right eye, along with a relative afferent pupil defect, suggests an optic nerve pathology. The fundus examination reveals optic disc swelling with tortuous veins, which could be indicative of papilledema. Papilledema is most commonly associated with elevated intracranial pressure, which can be caused by various conditions such as tumors, hemorrhages, or infections in the brain or orbits. To further assess the underlying cause of the optic disc swelling and rule out any intracranial pathology, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is warranted. This imaging can provide more detailed information about the optic nerve and surrounding structures, helping to identify any potential underlying causes. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Antibiotics (option B) would not be indicated without evidence of an infectious etiology. Steroids (option C) might be considered if there was evidence of an inflammatory condition, but further evaluation is needed before initiating treatment. Serologic tests (option D) might be considered later, depending on the MRI results and the clinical suspicion for any particular conditions.

The correct answer is B: Nasal encephalocele.

Explanation: A nasal encephalocele is a rare congenital abnormality characterized by the protrusion of intracranial contents through a defect in the skull base, typically in the nasal region. In this case, the trunklike projection from the medial canthus of the left eye suggests an encephalocele, as it is connected to a thin pedicle and associated with mucus discharge. The absence of other craniofacial anomalies and normal bilateral nasal cavities further support this diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ruled out associated craniofacial abnormalities. Supernumerary nostril refers to an additional nostril, which is not the case here. Proboscis lateralis is a term used to describe a tubular appendage arising from various facial locations, whereas cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by specific facial features, intellectual disability, and abnormal brain development.

The diagnosis for the case is D: Uterine leiomyoma.

Explanation:
Based on the history and physical examination findings, as well as the CT scan image showing a well-circumscribed mass, the most likely diagnosis is a uterine leiomyoma. Uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are benign tumors that arise from smooth muscle cells in the uterus. They are typically firm, mobile, and nontender. In this case, the patient's previous cesarean section history may be associated with the development of the leiomyoma. The definitive diagnosis and treatment can be achieved through an elective exploratory laparotomy and resection.

Answer: A: Broaden coverage with intravenous antibiotics and proceed with cholecystectomy.

Explanation: The patient is septic with a history of blood loss and an abnormal gallbladder finding on CT scan. The combination of these findings suggests a possible emphysematous cholecystitis, a life-threatening infection of the gallbladder. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to broaden coverage with intravenous antibiotics and proceed with cholecystectomy, which is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. This approach would help to control the infection and prevent further complications. Option B (performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is not indicated as there is no evidence of a bile duct obstruction. Options C (doing nothing) and D (performing celiotomy and enterotomy with gallstone extraction) are not appropriate as they do not address the underlying infection in the gallbladder.

Answer: C: Linear IgA dermatosis

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation of a 5-year-old girl with pruritic, bullous skin lesions that are distributed on the lower limbs initially and then spread to the upper limbs, trunk, vulva, and perineum, the most likely diagnosis is linear IgA dermatosis. This condition is characterized by tense bullae filled with clear fluid, often with a rosette-like appearance. The intense erythematous rash involving the vulva and perineum is also characteristic of linear IgA dermatosis. The negative results for anti-transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies rule out celiac disease-associated dermatitis herpetiformis (herpetiform dermatitis) as a diagnosis. Pemphigus is characterized by flaccid bullae that easily rupture, which is not seen in this case. Erythema multiforme typically presents with target-like lesions, which are not described in this case.

The diagnosis is C: Spontaneous rupture of the spleen.

Explanation: The image shows free fluid in the upper quadrants of the abdomen, indicating a possible ruptured organ. Given the patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain and distension, along with the recent viral illness, spontaneous rupture of the spleen is the most likely diagnosis. This can occur as a rare complication after a viral illness, as the spleen can become enlarged and fragile. Prompt surgical intervention would be necessary in this case.

D: Perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation.

Explanation: The patient presents with painful leg ulcerations and necrotic black eschars on the lower extremities, which are concerning for a potential skin condition. The next step in the evaluation would be to perform a biopsy of one of the skin lesions to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This will help determine the underlying cause of the ulcerations and guide further management. A computed tomography scan or an ultrasound of the lower extremities may be indicated later in the workup, depending on the biopsy results. A urine toxicology screen to check for cocaine use is not necessary based on the clinical presentation and history provided.

B: Obtain a bacterial culture from the pustules

Explanation: Since the patient is receiving chemotherapy and has developed pustules on the scalp, it is important to rule out infection as a cause. Obtaining a bacterial culture from the pustules can help identify the causative organism and guide appropriate treatment if infection is present. This is especially important considering the increase in lesions and the presence of hair loss, which may indicate a worsening condition. The other options (A, C, D) are not necessary at this point as they don't address the possibility of infection.

D: Perform rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing from a vesicle.

Explanation: Given the presentation of a 4-day-old neonate with a vesicular rash that developed hours after birth, it is important to investigate for possible infectious etiologies. The most appropriate next step would be to perform rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing from a vesicle. This can help identify the causative organism, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), which can cause a vesicular rash in neonates. Prompt identification and treatment of HSV infection in neonates is crucial, as it can lead to severe morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Skin biopsy can also be considered for pathologic evaluation, but the rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing would provide more immediate results for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be the appropriate next step as it would not address a viral infection like HSV, and doing nothing and waiting for spontaneous resolution could risk the potentially serious consequences of untreated HSV infection.

D: Obtain a detailed list of the patient’s medications.

Explanation: Before making any treatment decisions, it is important to obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications. This will help determine if a medication-induced cause of acute bilateral angle closure is likely. Certain medications, such as anticholinergics or sympathomimetics, can cause pupillary dilation and lead to angle closure. By reviewing the patient's medication history, the healthcare provider can assess for any possible medication-related causes and make appropriate treatment decisions.

The correct answer is C: Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa.

Explanation: Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa (VTS) is a rare cutaneous disorder that typically affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with solid organ transplants or hematologic malignancies. It is caused by the polyomavirus, specifically the human polyomavirus 7 (HPyV7). Clinically, VTS presents with multiple spiny follicular hyperkeratotic papules, often on the face, which are associated with alopecia involving the eyebrows and eyelashes. Microscopic examination reveals abnormal maturation of hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation.

Keratosis pilaris is a common, benign condition characterized by small, rough, flesh-colored or red bumps typically found on the upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. It is usually asymptomatic and does not cause alopecia.

Filiform verrucae, also known as filiform warts, are a type of cutaneous wart caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). They typically present as small, finger-like projections on the skin and are more commonly found on the face and neck. They do not cause alopecia.

B: Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics and serial abdominal examinations.

Explanation:
Based on the given history and physical examination findings, as well as the CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis. The patient presents with typical clinical signs such as constant mid-epigastric and supraumbilical abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, tenderness, and guarding in the lower abdomen. The positive psoas sign is suggestive of irritation of the psoas muscle due to inflammation in the right lower quadrant, which is a common finding in appendicitis.

The CT scan shows an enlarged, inflamed appendix with surrounding fat stranding, which further supports the diagnosis. The absence of any other significant abnormalities on the CT scan suggests that the appendix is the source of the patient's symptoms.

In this scenario, the best course of action would be to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infection associated with appendicitis and closely monitor the patient with serial abdominal examinations. This approach allows for conservative management and observation for any signs of worsening or complications. If the patient deteriorates or fails to improve, surgical intervention such as laparoscopic appendectomy may be considered.

Admitting the patient for observation is an option, but it would be more appropriate to actively manage a suspected case of acute appendicitis.

Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound may not provide additional information compared to the CT scan already obtained, and it may delay appropriate management in this acute presentation.

Answer Option: B: Proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an abdominal wall hernia, likely an incisional hernia. The presence of a reducible protrusion in the left flank, worsening with standing, coughing, and straining, suggests an underlying hernia. The hyperpigmented macules on the overlying skin may be related to the chronicity of the hernia or previous surgical scars.

Given the patient's stable condition and the absence of any concerning findings on CT, the next step would be to proceed with expectant treatment. This involves close observation and monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or complications associated with the hernia. Surgical repair may be considered if the hernia becomes incarcerated, strangulated, or causes significant pain or functional impairment in the future.

Emergency laparoscopy (option A) would not be warranted in this case as the patient is stable and there are no findings on CT indicating an acute surgical emergency.

Treatment with oral acyclovir (option C) is not necessary at this time since the patient's herpes zoster infection has likely resolved. Antiviral agents are most effective when initiated within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms.

Requesting a lower gastrointestinal series (option D) would not be indicated as there are no findings in the history or physical examination to suggest a lower gastrointestinal pathology. Moreover, the CT scan did not reveal any abnormalities in the abdominal cavity.

I would choose option C: Perform a thoracotomy to remove the foreign body.

Explanation: The patient has a foreign body in the right side of the chest, as seen on the radiographs and CT scan. Given the patient's stable condition and the presence of a foreign body, performing a thoracotomy is the most appropriate course of action to remove the foreign body and assess for any potential damage or bleeding in the chest. A thoracotomy provides direct access to the thoracic cavity and allows for thorough exploration and intervention if necessary. Options A, B, and D are not indicated based on the given information.

Based on the information provided, the next appropriate step would be to order urgent serum titers of IgG and IgM for Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis (answer choice C). 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including lines across the vision and photopsias, along with the findings from the dilated examination of the right eye, suggest a possible parasitic infection. Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis are two parasitic worms that can cause ocular larva migrans, which can present with similar symptoms. Ordering serum titers for these infections will help confirm or rule out the presence of these parasites and guide further management. Other answer choices such as pars plana vitrectomy, systemic antihelmintic therapy, or photocoagulation are not indicated or supported by the given information.
The most likely diagnosis is B: Primary varicella (chickenpox).
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the fever, rash, and papulovesicles with hemorrhagic crust, is consistent with primary varicella infection. Varicella is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and typically presents with a prodrome of fever and malaise, followed by the development of a pruritic rash. The rash starts as pink papules, which progress to vesicles and then form crusts. The distribution of the rash typically begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. The patient's vaccination history suggests that this is not a breakthrough case of varicella. Other differentials, such as disseminated herpes simplex, staphylococcal pustulosis, and rickettsialpox, can be excluded based on the clinical and histologic findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary varicella.

The answer to this case is: C: Cholecystocolonic fistula.

Explanation: The CT scan (Figure 1) shows air within the gallbladder (GB), liver (Li), and proximal bowel, consistent with biliary-enteric communication. The CT scan (Figure 2) shows a cholecystocolonic fistula (B, arrowhead), with passage of air from the colon into the gallbladder (A, closed arrow). The fistula can be observed at the colon (asterisks) and gallbladder (arrow). The patient had a cholecystocolonic fistula, which allowed gut bacteria to enter the biliary system and subsequently cause bacteremia. This is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, occurring in fewer than 2% of cases, most often secondary to direct erosion of the gallbladder wall into the colon. The clinical presentation is often nonspecific, and the diagnosis is often made incidentally on radiographic imaging.

The diagnosis in this case is C: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, and they can arise from any part of the GI tract, including the stomach. They typically present as a progressively enlarging mass associated with abdominal distention and discomfort.

The imaging findings described, including a partially well-circumscribed, mixed cystic and solitary mass that partially envelops the stomach, are consistent with the characteristics of a GIST.

The other answer options are less likely in this case:
A: Exophytic solitary giant cavernous hemangiomas of the stomach are rare, and they typically present as asymptomatic lesions that may cause gastrointestinal bleeding. The imaging findings described do not support this diagnosis.
B: Complicated cysts are not typically associated with the same features as described in this case. Additionally, complications of cysts are usually associated with infection or rupture, which are not mentioned in the case.
D: Neurilemmomas arise from peripheral nerves and are uncommon in the gastrointestinal tract. They do not typically present with the specific features described in this case.

Answer: C: Recommend an extended esophageal myotomy

Explanation: Given the findings of food stasis, large diverticula, and extensive candidiasis, as well as the severe exacerbation of symptoms and progressive weight loss, the most appropriate next step would be to recommend an extended esophageal myotomy. This surgical procedure involves cutting the muscles of the esophagus to relieve pressure and improve its ability to empty. It is typically performed in cases of esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia, which is characterized by hypertensive propagated pressure waves and impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. In this case, the patient's symptoms and esophageal manometry findings are consistent with a motility disorder, and conservative measures, such as analgesia and antifungal therapy, have failed to improve the symptoms or halt the weight loss. Therefore, an extended esophageal myotomy would be the best course of action to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B: Immunoelectron microscopy

Explanation: The clinical presentation of disseminated sharply demarcated, dome-shaped, red-brown papules and nodules with a shiny, waxy surface, along with the biopsy findings of lymphocytes, plasma cells, foamy histiocytoid cells, multinucleated cells, and emperipolesis, suggests a diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). ECD is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by histiocyte proliferation and infiltration in various organs. Immunoelectron microscopy is used to identify specific markers and confirm the presence of histiocytes in the biopsy sample. Acid-fast staining is not applicable in this case as ECD is not associated with mycobacterial infection. Immunohistochemical testing may be used to further characterize the histiocytes, but it is not specifically mentioned in the case that further characterization is needed. PAS staining is also not necessary as no specific indication for it is mentioned in the case. Therefore, the next step in the diagnostic workup would be immunoelectron microscopy to confirm the presence of histiocytes in the biopsy sample.

The diagnosis is C: Hepatic abscess.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain, and nausea, along with the physical examination findings and marked increase in inflammatory markers, suggest an infection. The presence of a solid, inhomogeneous mass in liver segment 6 on abdominal ultrasonographic examination, along with the findings on contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging, point towards a hepatic abscess. Other potential diagnoses, such as hydatid cyst, infected biliary cystadenoma, and inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver, can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

The diagnosis is D: Giant cell tumor.

Explanation: The presentation of osteolytic lesions in the distal femur and the head of the tibia, along with cystic and nonsclerotic appearance on magnetic resonance imaging, and the presence of spindle cell infiltrates, hemorrhages, fragmented trabecular bone, and osteoclastic giant cells on histopathological examination, are all consistent with a giant cell tumor. The additional lesions found in the left distal femur and the left mandible further support this diagnosis. Aneurysmatic bone cysts can appear similar on imaging, but the histopathological findings and the presence of multiple lesions make this diagnosis less likely. Malignant bone tumors and primary hyperparathyroidism with multiple brown tumors would present with different clinical and histopathological features.
