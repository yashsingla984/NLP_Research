Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is (D) Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. The patient presents with a neck mass and hypereosinophilia, which are characteristic of this condition. The positron emission tomographicâ€“computed tomographic scan also shows involvement of the left inguinal lymph node, which is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient's elevated white blood cell count, high eosinophil count, and abnormal blood chemistry results are also consistent with this diagnosis. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
Extracted Character: D
