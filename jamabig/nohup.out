Title: Coin-Shaped Opacities in the Stomach Case is: A 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital for treatment of calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. His home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.Chest radiograph showing 4 rounded objects in patient’s stomach.What Would You Do Next?

He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).

On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.

The most likely diagnosis is that the patient has ingested a foreign body, which has lodged in his stomach. The foreign body could be a medication tablet, a piece of food, or something else. The patient's symptoms, including the intermittent apneic episodes, are consistent with a foreign body in the stomach.

The next step in the management of this patient is to arrange for an endoscopy. An endoscopy is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube with a camera into the patient's stomach. The doctor will be able to see the foreign body and remove it if possible. If the foreign body cannot be removed endoscopically, the patient may need to have surgery.

The answer is: B. Arrange endoscopy.

After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.

The most likely diagnosis is that the patient has ingested four lanthanum tablets. Lanthanum is a rare earth metal that is used as a phosphate binder in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. It is a relatively insoluble salt and can cause obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract if ingested in large amounts.

The next step in management is to arrange for endoscopy to remove the lanthanum tablets. This can be done either through a flexible endoscope or a rigid endoscope. Flexible endoscopes are more commonly used for this procedure, but rigid endoscopes may be necessary if the tablets are large or if they are located in the distal esophagus or stomach.

The patient should also be given supportive care, including intravenous fluids and electrolytes. He should be monitored closely for signs of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, hypoxemia, and cyanosis. If the patient develops respiratory distress, he may need to be intubated and ventilated.

The patient should also be given antibiotics to prevent infection. The most common organisms that cause infection after ingestion of foreign bodies are staphylococci and streptococci.

The patient's prognosis is generally good if the lanthanum tablets are removed promptly. However, there is a risk of complications, such as perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, infection, and aspiration pneumonia.

Reasoning:

The patient has ingested four lanthanum tablets, which are radio-opaque and can be seen on a chest radiograph. Lanthanum is a relatively insoluble salt and can cause obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract if ingested in large amounts. The next step in management is to arrange for endoscopy to remove the lanthanum tablets. This can be done either through a flexible endoscope or a rigid endoscope.

Title: Pediatric Patient With Persistent Postoperative Fevers After Esophageal Foreign Body Removal Case is: A healthy patient in their teens presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever (38.7 °C), neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count (22 500/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done (Figure, C).A, Axial cut of computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck demonstrating free air in the left lobe of the thyroid gland (arrowheads). B, Sagittal cut of neck CT scan showing 2-cm radiodense osseous foreign body in the upper cervical esophagus at C6 level (arrowhead). C, Coronal cut of CT scan showing gas in the thyroid gland (arrowheads).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Parapharyngeal abscess , B: Retropharyngeal abscess , C: Emphysematous thyroiditis , D: Mediastinitis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option.

Reasoning:
The patient is a healthy teenager who presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count. Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done, which showed gas in the thyroid gland.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of emphysematous thyroiditis. Emphysematous thyroiditis is a rare, life-threatening infection of the thyroid gland that is caused by gas-forming bacteria. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, but can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals. The most common presentation is fever, neck pain, and tenderness, with or without dysphagia. On imaging, emphysematous thyroiditis is characterized by the presence of gas within the thyroid gland. Treatment is with antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery.

Answer: C. Emphysematous thyroiditis

Title: Tzanck Smear of Ulcerated Plaques Case is: A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows. B, Tzanck smear using Wright-Giemsa staining of specimen demonstrating ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material (original magnification ×20).What Is Your Diagnosis?
