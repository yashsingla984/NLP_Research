D: Provide supportive care.

Explanation: The patient's lowered mental status and hypoxia can be attributed to opioid toxicity, which is evident from the improvement in his condition after the administration of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist. The coin-shaped opacities seen in the stomach are most likely the sevelamer and lanthanum tablets the patient has been taking. Both sevelamer and lanthanum are phosphate binders used to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage kidney disease. These drugs are not absorbed systemically but work within the gastrointestinal tract to prevent phosphate absorption from dietary intake. They can also appear radiopaque on imaging and may mimic the appearance of foreign bodies or medications. Endoscopic retrieval of medications (choice B) that appear on imaging is generally not needed unless there is obstruction or localized symptoms, which this patient does not have. Additionally, activated charcoal (choice A) and gastric lavage (choice C) are interventions for specific gastrointestinal decontaminations in poisoning and are not routinely recommended because the risks often outweigh the benefits. In this case, the patient should receive supportive care (choice D), continuing the naloxone infusion and respiratory support as needed. The patient should further be advised to take these phosphate binders with meals to maximize their efficacy, and in case of any unusual symptoms, he should seek medical help immediately.

C: Emphysematous thyroiditis 

Explanation: The presence of gas within the thyroid gland and the persistent fevers postoperatively suggest emphysematous thyroiditis. This is an uncommon but severe infection of the thyroid gland characterized by the presence of gas on imaging studies. The causative organism is usually a gas-forming bacteria or fungus. The clinical condition usually presents with a painful neck swelling, fever, dysphagia, and increased inflammatory markers. Antibiotic treatment with broad-spectrum coverage against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is the mainstay therapy. However, incision and drainage or thyroidectomy can also be considered in severe cases. Parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscesses would present with neck mass or swelling and leukocytosis but typically don't have gas in the thyroid. Mediastinitis would have more extensive involvement down to the mediastinum, usually with chest pain and maybe dyspnea.

A: Herpes simplex virus

Explanation: The presence of painful umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders, new-onset cough and the patient's immunocompromised state with AIDS are suggestive of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The Tzanck smear further strengthens the diagnosis of HSV by demonstrating the characteristic features of ballooning keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material. The absence of systemic symptoms rules out other infectious diseases such as histoplasmosis and molluscum contagiosum. Herpes infection is also more common among people living with AIDS due to their weakened immune system. Molluscum contagiosum generally presents as flesh-colored, dome-shaped, and pearly lesions rather than ulcerated plaques. Poxvirus doesn't cause plaque formation.

C: Repeat complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks. 

Explanation: 
The patient received a chemotherapy regimen with carboplatin/gemcitabine and G-CSF that can mobilize immature cells (ie, blasts) to the periphery, mimicking a peripheral blast crisis suggesting acute leukemia. However, in this context, these findings should be considered a consequence of the chemotherapy and G-CSF–induced bone marrow mobilization. The significantly increased ferritin level may be due to inflammation and anemia of chronic disease, commonly seen in malignancies. Thus, it would be appropriate to observe the patient and repeat the complete blood count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks to ensure that the immature cells decrease as the effects of G-CSF wane.

C: Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy

Explanation: The patient’s progressive, unilateral cranial neuropathy involving multiple cranial nerves, with a history of various cutaneous malignancies is suggestive of perineural spread of cancer. Cutaneous malignancies, especially squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma, can invade the nerves and spread along the neural sheath. This can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, depending on the nerves affected. The MRI could have been normal, as early perineural spread may not be readily visible on imaging. The history of cutaneous cancers, the progressive nature of the disease, the normal inflammatory markers, and the negative tumor markers from the cerebrospinal fluid all lead towards this diagnosis.

D: Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions

Explanation: The young man's presentation of hypereosinophilia (elevated eosinophil levels) plus the presence of atypical cells suggesting T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, and FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement (seen in interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization) are indicative of a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and specific genetic abnormalities. Kimura disease is a benign disorder associated with eosinophilia but does not exhibit the atypical lymphoid cells or FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma would not show a high percentage of eosinophils or T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cells. T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia would show T lymphoblasts but would not show a FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement or elevated eosinophil counts. Consequently, the best fit for this case is 'D: Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions' due to the combination of high eosinophil counts, FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement, and the presence of atypical T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia cells.

B: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease

Explanation: The pathological findings of extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris along with histiocytes and dendritic cells absence of neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies, are consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). This rare disease often presents with fever and cervical lymphadenopathy, commonly in young women. The disease can mimic more serious conditions such as lymphoma, lupus, and other autoimmune diseases, leading to diagnostic challenges. However negative findings for lymphoma and autoimmune conditions, coupled with these patient's specific histopathologic findings, support a diagnosis of KFD.

A: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation: Given the initial findings in this elderly woman, the key diagnosis to rule out would be cardiac sarcoidosis. This can be done by performing a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRI, in this scenario, can help identify any granulomatous inflammation or disease that might have spread to the heart, commonly found in conditions like sarcoidosis. If cardiac sarcoidosis is confirmed, it may clarify the etiology of the ventricular tachycardia and change management including therapy to suppress the underlying inflammation. Considering the patient's severe RV and LV dysfunction and progression of pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cardiac MRI could provide vital diagnostic information, which could direct the next steps in patient management. An electrophysiology study may not provide as comprehensive information about the involvement of the myocardium by granulomatous inflammation. Genetic testing does not have a role in this setting. Considering the reversible cause for the ventricular tachycardia implantation of a cardiac defibrillator may not be the best next step.

C: Diffuse-type neurofibroma

Explanation: The MRI findings, especially marked vascularity and lack of osseous destruction or intracranial extension, and the histopathological findings characterized by the presence of spindle cells staining positive for S100 and Sox10, strongly suggest a diagnosis of diffuse-type neurofibroma. Although scalp neurofibromas are relatively rare, they have been described in literature with similar presentations. Histologically, diffuse neurofibromas have a poorly circumscribed, infiltrative growth pattern and are composed of spindle cells with elongated, wavy nuclei interspersed in a collagenous to myxoid stroma. Additionally, they frequently express S100 and Sox10, which are sensitive and specific markers for neural crest-derived cells, including Schwann cells which are the predominant cell type in neurofibromas. All the descriptions in this case are consistent with this diagnosis. Option A: arteriovenous malformation and D: dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans were less likely due to the absence of other symptoms and signs specific to these conditions. Option B: solitary fibrous tumor was considered but the lack of significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity and positivity for S100 and Sox10 make it less likely.
C
8
D: Phaeohyphomycosis

Explanation: The development of destructive facial plaques and respiratory tract involvement over a decade along with the hard palate perforation, indicates a slow-growing granulomatous infection. The absence of systemic symptoms, chronicity, distribution of lesions and the histology with pigmented yeast cells without multiaxial septation are characteristic of phaeohyphomycosis, an infection caused by dematiaceous (dark-walled) fungi. Other fungal infections like chromoblastomycosis and blastomycosis usually present with verrucous skin lesions and features of systemic involvement respectively, and hyalohyphomycosis is associated with colorless hyphae. The presentation being noticeably localized and slow-growing points towards phaeohyphomycosis (option D).

B: Meningioma. 

Explanation: The histologic findings align best with a diagnosis of Meningioma. The cells described with abundant cytoplasm and oval nuclei arranged in syncytial clusters, and occasional whorls and pseudoinclusions are characteristics of meningiomas. Furthermore, psammomatous calcifications are common in meningiomas. Also, the positivity in immunohistochemical stains for EMA and vimentin further supports this diagnosis. Meningiomas are unusual in this location, and they can cause erosion and sclerosis in adjacent bone, which could explain the imaging findings in this case. The other options are not entirely consistent with these histologic and staining features.
B
10
A: Leishmaniasis

Explanation: The patient's travel history to Guyana, a region endemic with Leishmaniasis, combined with symptoms of sore throat, ulceration of the uvula, and past subcutaneous nodules and cellulitis, point towards a likely diagnosis of Leishmaniasis. Furthermore, the appearance of granulomatous inflammation both in the uvula and previously in the neck also supports this diagnosis. Other conditions with granulomatous inflammation, such as tuberculosis and leprosy, would usually have different presentation or systemic signs which do not align with this case. Lethal midline granuloma often presents with more aggressive destruction of nasal and oral tissues, and it's usually associated with malignancy, which is not evident in this case. Leishmania organisms can be difficult to detect with standard staining procedures, which could explain the initially negative results.
A
11
D: Oral involvement of mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: The patient has a known diagnosis of stage IVA1 (T4N1M0B2) mycosis fungoides, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. The new appearance of hyperpigmented patches in the oral mucosa and her history of widespread skin involvement with mycosis fungoides makes alternative diagnoses less likely. The patient's oral pigmentation does not present in a manner typical of Laugier-Hunziker syndrome, melanoma, or as a medication adverse effect. Instead, it's consistent with the progression of her known disease, despite previous treatments.

12
C: Serological testing for onchocerciasis. 

Explanation: The disappearing, migratory nature of the conjunctival body and the patient's history from Nigeria, a country endemic for onchocerciasis, makes it highly probable that the patient has the disease known as “river blindness” caused by Onchocerca volvulus. Moreover, the patient's transient facial and hand swelling coupled with a mildly elevated eosinophil count also support the diagnosis. Therefore, a serological test for onchocerca volvulus antigens is the preferred choice. While diethylcarbamazine is a potential treatment, it wouldn't be the necessary next step without having a confirmed diagnosis. Exploration and removal of the foreign body would not guarantee that all the filarial worms are removed and might miss the potential systemic implications of the parasite. Lastly, a peripheral blood smear is usually not helpful as microfilariae are not typically seen in blood in onchocerciasis.

13
C: Observe with no additional testing or intervention

Explanation: Given the patient's age, the history of trauma to the eye, and the lesion's characteristics like the gravity-dependent mobility, absence of solid components, and mild iris stromal bulging, the lesion is most likely an iris pigment epithelial cyst. These cysts can be watched without intervention if they are not increasing in size or causing corneal edema or intraocular pressure elevation. Thus observation without any immediate need for additional testing or intervention would be the most suitable approach.

B: Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa. 

Explanation: Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (ENV) is a condition characterized by chronic lymphedema, leading to skin thickening and tissue fibrosis. It commonly results from recurrent infections, surgeries, or venous stasis, leading to lymphatic obstruction and subsequent marked subcutaneous fibrosis and skin verrucosity. Given the patient's clinical history of long-standing induration and thickening of the legs, her known diagnosis of ENV, the presentation of skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque, along with the absence of other specific symptoms, it is more likely that her condition is Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa. Other options mentioned such as pretibial myxedema, lobomycosis or euthyroid pretibial mucinosis would not match well with the patient’s symptomatology and medical history.

15
B: Familial cerebral cavernous malformations 

Explanation: The clinical picture, family history and mutational analysis results are consistent with a diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs). CCMs are vascular malformations in the brain and spinal cord. They contain slow-flow capillary venous channels lined by a single layer of endothelium. Bleeding may occur. CCMs are associated with neurological symptoms, such as seizures, focal neurological deficits, and headaches, and these can be the first symptom. In this particular case, the patient’s recurrent seizures and the presence of hemiparesis and hemianopsia due to an intracranial hemorrhage in her early life suggest a long history of CCMs. Familial form of CCMs is often associated with multiple lesions throughout the brain as seem in this case. KRIT1 gene mutations are known to be associated with CCMs, providing a genetic confirmation of the diagnosis. The presence of CCM in the patient’s father and aunt further supports the diagnosis of familial CCMs. While Skin lesions are less common they have been found in some patients with KRIT1 mutations.

B: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

Explanation: The diagnosis remains in question with this patient's case. The amelanotic fundus lesion observed could represent a number of possible diseases such as an amelanotic choroidal melanoma, choroidal metastasis, or a secondary effect from her previous retinal detachment surgery including extraocular extension of scleral buckle or scleral buckle intrusion. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy will help in confirming the diagnosis by allowing analysis of cells from the lesion. After obtaining conclusive results, a more pointed treatment plan can then be instituted. The other options mentioned: whole-body positron emission tomography scan, plaque radiotherapy, and observation are less preferable due to either being too invasive without a clear diagnosis (plaque radiotherapy), not directly addressing the lesion (whole-body positron emission tomography scan), or possibly delays necessary intervention (observation).

17
C: Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP)

Explanation: Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) is most consistent with the clinical presentation and histopathologic examination described in this case. EBP is characterized by intensely pruritic, lichenified plaques and nodules, which often lead to milia formation and erosions, predominantly in the pretibial area. Moreover, the histopathology of EBP often reveals dermoepidermal separation, consistent with the case description. Other options are less likely: Pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD) and Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) do not typically present with the formation of erosions and milia. Lichen amyloidosis (LA) can present with lichenified papules, but it does not typically cause erosions and milia. Furthermore, the longevity of the condition (more than ten years) aligns with the chronic progression often observed in EBP.

18
B: Order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis 

Explanation: The clinical findings in the presented case, including systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache), macular star, and optic disc swelling, are strongly suggestive of neuroretinitis. Neuroretinitis is most often associated with infectious causes, particularly Bartonella species in children and adolescents. These commonly present with systemic symptoms which suggest a flu-like illness that precedes eye disease. By ordering serologic testing, the physician can identify the causative agent (usually a bacterium) and provide targeted treatment. The other options, although relevant in certain contexts, do not directly address the most likely cause given the clinical presentation. For example, systemic corticosteroids are usually considered when an autoimmune etiology is suspected, whereas ruling out a brain tumor or checking blood pressure would be more pertinent if neurologic symptoms beyond lethargy or hypertension-related changes, respectively, were present.

B: Rhabdomyoma

Explanation: The features of the mass like its firm-to-palpation quality, its proportionality to the child's somatic growth, and the MRI findings of it being uniformly solid and well circumscribed, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense on T1 with homogenous contrast enhancement are classic characteristics of a rhabdomyoma. Hemangiomas, on the other hand, generally show flow voids on imaging due to their vascular nature. Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant tumors and generally would have an aggressive behavior and grow disproportionately. Teratomas are usually cystic in nature and have components of all three germ layers. Therefore, the most suitable diagnosis in this case would be rhabdomyoma.

B

A: Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site

Explanation: The most important next step in the management of this patient is a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site. Given the patient's recurrent postoperative skin findings characterized by erythema, edema, serous fluid drainage, prodromal pain and pruritus and then development of an erythematous papulovesicular rash, herpes simplex virus reactivation should be suspected. This can be particularly common in the setting of surgical trauma. The gold standard for diagnosis is a skin biopsy that shows multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusions within keratinocytes. The skin biopsy will provide definitive diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infection. The other options could be considered, but without performing the skin biopsy and getting a definitive diagnosis, they might not treat the correct condition. So, the best next step would be to get a clear diagnosis via a biopsy.

A: Disseminated fusariosis

Explanation: The presence of the painful necrotic skin lesions, pulmonary findings on the CT scan, and the results of the lactophenol cotton blue staining of a tissue culture colony showing septated hyphae and oval microconidia align with a diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis. This is a serious fungal infection that can occur in people with a weakened immune system, like the patient in question here who has a history of multiple myeloma and is undergoing a procedure that involves suppressing her immune system. Invasive aspergillosis, pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum, and sweet syndrome do not typically present with this specific combination of symptoms and laboratory findings.

22
D: Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides. 

Explanation: Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides is a type of cutaneous metastasis where carcinoma cells spread into the dermal lymphatics causing the characteristic appearance of skin lesions. Given this patient's history of primary salivary duct carcinoma, it's quite possible that these new skin findings represent metastatic spread of his original disease. The lesions began on his face, where his primary tumor is located, and have spread to his chest. Furthermore, the clinical appearance of these lesions matches with what we often see in carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides: erythematous to violaceous plaques with blackish papules and nodules. Radiologically noted regression of the primary tumor could be due to the migration of the tumor cells to distant tissues leading to apparent reduction in size of the primary focus. Hence, carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides seems most likely in this case considering other options.

23
C: Bullous pilomatricoma

Explanation: The diagnosis for this case is most likely Bullous pilomatricoma given the patient's clinical and histopathological presentation. Though all the given options are variants of skin tumors, Bullous pilomatricoma specifically can present as a protruding red tumorous growth on the skin as described. Histologically, it's often distinguished by the presence of shadow cells and basophilic cells, a finding which corresponds to the observed pathology in this case. Matrical Carcinoma and Panfolliculoma generally don't show the same bullous presentation, and Trichodiscoma is a benign tumor typically associated with tuberous sclerosis, lacking the shadow/basophilic cells characteristic of Pilomatricoma.

24
B: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging to look for associated central nervous system tumors 

Explanation: The presence of a exudative retinal lesion along with the other symptoms such as a vascular papule, lightly pigmented patches of skin, and subungual fibromas suggest a possible diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous benign tumors in various parts of the body, including the brain. The clinical findings in this patient are consistent with an astrocytic hamartoma of the retina, which is a hallmark ocular finding of TSC. Therefore, ordering brain magnetic resonance imaging is appropriate because it allows the detection of associated central nervous system tumors which are common in TSC. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment would only address the eye symptom and ignore potential other concerning systemic symptoms. A hypercoagulable workup and an echocardiogram plus carotid ultrasonography might be helpful for other conditions but are less appropriate given the clinical presentation and the high suspicion of TSC. The first goal should be to confirm the diagnosis of TSC and assess the severity of the disease by looking for associated central nervous system tumors.

B: Check an antisynthetase antibody panel

Explanation: This patient's presentation of fever, weight loss, dysphagia (due to esophageal involvement), interstitial lung disease (manifested by bibasilar crackles on examination and ground glass opacities and consolidations on imaging), mechanics’ hands, and positive antinuclear antibodies is suggestive of an autoimmune inflammatory myositis syndrome. The presence of Raynaud phenomenon and a violaceous, maculopapular rash over his neck and shoulders (the shawl sign) further narrows the differential to either dermatomyositis or polymyositis, both of which fall under the umbrella of inflammatory myositis syndromes. 

Given these findings, the next step would be option B, to check an antisynthetase antibody panel. The presence of certain antisynthetase antibodies can suggest a specific subtype of inflammatory myositis, aid in prognosis, and guide further management. A lung biopsy (option A) isn't warranted at this point because the patient's lung findings could very likely be explained by an inflammatory myositis syndrome. A muscle biopsy (option C) could help to confirm suspected myositis but is invasive and wouldn't necessarily be the next step after initial serologic testing. Starting treatment with corticosteroids such as prednisone (option D) may greatly alleviate symptoms but should ideally be done after confirming the diagnosis.

D: Schwannoma. 

Explanation: Schwannomas, also known as neurilemmomas, are benign tumors that originate from the schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. They are commonly found involving the head and neck, including the parapharyngeal space, but involvement of the oropharynx and hypopharynx is rare. The presented case involves a large, well-circumscribed mass seen in the oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components, which is characteristic of schwannomas. These tumors are typically slow-growing and present with progressive symptoms, as seen in this case with dysphagia and dyspnea. Also, lack of pain, a symptom often associated with other differential diagnoses, further suggests schwannoma. Diagnostic confirmation often requires histopathological examination.
C
27
C: Order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin

Explanation: The child's signs and symptoms of bilateral ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia are suggestive of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS and its variants are commonly associated with a preceding infection and tend to manifest with bilateral mydriasis, which is the presence of large, fixed pupils, as seen in this case. Detection of anti-GQ1b antibodies in serum is a reliable diagnostic tool for MFS, as these are present in most patients with the condition. Given the clinical scenario that points towards an immune-mediated disease, it is fitting to start the patient with intravenous immune globulin, a front-line therapy for GBS and MFS, before the results of the antibody test are available. Antibiotics would not be the first consideration as cultures remained without growth, and there is no infectious dimension reflected in the host response. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid studies and intravenous corticosteroids would not take precedence given the clinical picture.

28
C: Melanoma

Explanation: The key findings pointing to this diagnosis are the highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells found in the biopsy, the positive SOX10 immunostain which is typically expressed in neural crest derivates including melanocytes, and the negative pankeratin which is usually positive in carcinomas (answers A, B, and D). Melanomas often present as growing masses, and this man's lesion started relatively small and increased in size. The evolution, the ulceration, the rapid growth, and the intense hypermetabolic activity shown in the PET-CT scan are also classic characteristics of a melanoma. Furthermore, the man's age and daily tobacco use increase his risk for melanoma. The presence of axillary lymph nodes suggests regional metastasis, which is also common in melanoma.

29
B: Stop prednisone and proceed with diagnostic vitrectomy

Explanation: Given the patient’s clinical presentation and results from the imaging studies, there is a very high suspicion of malignancy-associated vasculitis given the patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and RCC. Stopping prednisone and proceeding with a diagnostic vitrectomy seems a rational next step. Although it's previously been noted that the vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells, there could be other potential malignant or inflammatory factors involved contributing to the observed vasculitis. Diagnostic vitrectomy would allow for more comprehensive histopathological evaluation and PCR testing, aiding in reaching definite diagnosis and tailoring an appropriate treatment plan. The options A, C, and D would not serve as much insight into diagnosing the true etiological factor and could potentially delay appropriate treatment. Option C, stopping cabozantinib, is not a preferred initial step because interference with his renal cell carcinoma management could have deleterious consequences. Magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture (option D) seem less likely to be immediately helpful considering the dominant ocular signs and symptoms.

C: Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery.

Explanation: Given the extensive destruction of the humeral head, as seen in the radiograph, the patient's mobility in that shoulder is severely impaired. The absence of the humeral head and reduced range of motion in the left shoulder suggests a need for intervention to restore functionality. If a tumor or infection had been suspected, then further imaging such as an MRI (A) would have been required, serum tumor marker testing (B) would have been the next step, or an urgent aspiration of the joint (D) would have been performed to diagnose and treat septic arthritis. However, with normal inflammatory markers, complete blood cell count, and no other signs of infection or malignancy, an orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery is more appropriate to consider. During the evaluation, the risks, benefits, and alternatives will be discussed, keeping in mind the patient's age and general health status to determine the most appropriate approach to management. The pain and reduced range of motion could be improved with a shoulder arthroplasty.

D: Coronary artery bypass grafting. 

Explanation: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an emergency that requires urgent intervention because it can lead to life-threatening myocardial infarction and unexpected sudden death. This patient's clinical picture, including the severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and the affected site of her SCAD (left main coronary artery), suggests a significant heart function impairment that requires immediate revascularization to restore blood supply in the parts of the heart transiently deprived of it. Percutaneous coronary intervention can be a high-risk procedure in SCAD due to the nature and delicacy of the dissection. Conservative medical management is typically not enough for critical left main SCAD cases like this. Given these considerations, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), in which a healthy artery or vein from the body is connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked coronary artery, is frequently the indicated procedure in order to promptly re-establish blood flow to the heart and minimize the risk of further complications. As per each individual case, the decision should be tailored on the basis of patient's conditions, doctor's experience, and available facilities.

B: VEXAS syndrome

Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation of treatment-resistant edematous annular plaques, mild leukopenia, and persistent low-grade fevers, along with his normal routine cancer screening results, and ineffective therapeutic trials, VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a likely diagnosis. This condition is a recently described genodermatosis caused by somatic mutations in UBA1, observable mostly in older men. It is associated with skin lesions similar to those described, as well as hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias. VEXAS syndrome responded poorly to multiple therapies, including immunosuppressives and corticosteroids, which aligns with the man's history. Thus, his clinical presentation, demographics, lab results, and lack of response to therapy in favor of VEXAS syndrome.

C: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency

Explanation: This patient's cutaneous changes accompanied by coagulation deficiency, specifically a decrease in factor X activity, lead to a diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disorder with coagulation deficiency. Both inherited cutis laxa syndrome (option B) and pseudoxanthoma elasticum (option A) parameters are primarily diagnosed through skin symptoms, which in this case includes notable skin laxity. However, the inheritance and additional extracutaneous involvement vary. 

This is unlike pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disorder with coagulation deficiency (option C). Reduced clotting factor activity, specifically a decrease in factor X, is an essential additional symptom of this rare disease. Although the patient exhibits pseudoxanthoma elasticum’s typical skin changes, they have no common extracutaneous symptoms of the disease such as cardiovascular or ocular abnormalities — which explains the normal echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results.

Lastly, the pseudoxanthoma elasticum/pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like overlap syndrome (option D) is a complex condition with overlapping characteristics of both pseudoxanthoma elasticum and pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disorder. As there's no ocular or cardiovascular involvement witnessed in this patient, this condition is also ruled out as a possible diagnosis. The familial incidence of the disorder in the case of this patient further supports the diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like disorder with coagulation deficiency—it is often an inherited condition.

B: Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies

Explanation: Given the child's clinical presentation and imaging findings, as well as his close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, it is highly likely that he is suffering from Echinococcus granulosus, a parasitic infection that causes hydatid disease. This parasite causes cystic lesions in the body, commonly in the liver and lungs. The serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies is a noninvasive and accurate diagnostic method that is considered the gold standard. While the other options (stool checking, lung biopsy, and liver biopsy) may also help in the diagnosis, they are either less reliable, more invasive or potentially dangerous given the risk of anaphylaxis if a cyst is accidentally ruptured during biopsies. This test should be performed before considering more invasive diagnostic measures such as biopsies.

C: Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing

Explanation: The patient’s skin lesions and neurological findings, such as the inability to extend fingers and foot drop, are suggestive of multibacillary leprosy or Hansen's disease. Despite the negative stains and PCR tests, the clinical picture along with granulomatous changes on biopsy samples highly suggest this diagnosis. The standard process for diagnosis of this condition is detection of acid-fast bacilli on a skin smear or biopsy, or the use of PCR to detect Mycobacterium leprae DNA. The US National Hansen’s Disease Program provides definitive molecular testing, including PCR, to support diagnosis. Thus, the skin biopsy should be sent to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for definitive testing. Treatment should not be initiated until a definitive diagnosis is confirmed.

36
A: Perform bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The patient's presentation of heart failure, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, weight loss, and increased cardiac uptake on bone scintigraphy is suggestive of systemic amyloidosis. Systemic amyloidosis occurs due to deposition of misfolded proteins in various tissues, leading to organ dysfunction. Cardiac involvement can manifest as heart failure, and peripheral nerve involvement can present as a sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Increased cardiac radiotracer uptake on bone scintigraphy can also be seen in cardiac amyloidosis. A bone marrow biopsy may be helpful to detect amyloid deposition and to identify the type of amyloid. SPEP and serum free light chain testing were not suggestive of light chain amyloidosis (AL), the most common form of systemic amyloidosis. Regardless, a bone marrow biopsy should be performed to identify any abnormal plasma cells, as this could provide valuable diagnostic information. Genetic testing, skin biopsies, and 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins may also be useful, but bone marrow biopsy should be performed first in order to confirm the diagnosis.

A: Ultrasound biomicroscopy

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including corkscrew conjunctival vessels, shallow anterior chamber, and choroidal detachment, are suggestive of a possible vascular or choroidal disorder. Ultrasound biomicroscopy can provide information about the ciliary body, the peripheral choroid, and other anterior segment structures and may reveal abnormalities consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. It would be used for the evaluation of anterior segment tumors, ciliary body cysts, and plenty of other pathologies. The other tests mentioned could be beneficial in certain cases, but given the specificity of the symptoms and signs, our first step should be to further investigate with imaging. Therefore, ultrasound biomicroscopy seems to be the immediate next step.

D: Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden decrease in visual acuity along with clinical findings of anterior uveitis, posterior synechiae, and retinal detachment without an associated visible tear suggest combined anterior and posterior segment complications. Thus, a combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery is the most comprehensive approach. Both phacoemulsification and vitrectomy would address the cataract and retinal detachment, potentially improving the patient’s vision. The other treatment options only address specific areas of the disease and would not comprehensively manage the patient's combined anterior and posterior issues.

B: Pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells.

Explanation: The ocular findings in this case are suggestive of a process involving the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, associated with a variety of systemic disorders including infectious, autoimmune, neoplastic, and drug-related etiologies. Given that the patient has a known history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and melanoma, and is on immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is a heightened suspicion for a neoplastic process such as intraocular lymphoma or a paraneoplastic process linked to immune checkpoint inhibitor use. Thus, a pars plana vitrectomy can be performed for vitreous and/or chorioretinal biopsy to directly assess for leukemic cells. This would provide a clear diagnostic path and would directly influence management. Whereas, a trial of systemic or local immunosuppression wouldn't only potentially exacerbate an infectious or neoplastic process, but also hamper the diagnosis by altering the cellular composition of the fluid obtained during vitrectomy.

C: Pleomorphic adenoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation alongside with the radiographic characteristics of the mass highlighted by the MRI (a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the prestyloid PPS that appears isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and shows heterogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration) is suggestive of a benign tumor, more specifically, a pleomorphic adenoma. While other options such as Schwannoma or a Venous malformation could theoretically present similarly, their imaging characteristics and the patient's symptoms push towards the diagnosis of a pleomorphic adenoma which is the most common benign salivary gland tumor and often occurs in the parapharyngeal space. Furthermore, the fine-needle aspiration that displayed blood, fibrin and rare mesenchymal cells hints towards a tissue structure, more common in tumor formations like pleomorphic adenoma.
B
41
C: Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) with perineural spread

Explanation: The patient's presentation is indicative of invasive fungal sinusitis, also known as mucormycosis, with perineural spread. The MRI findings showing maxillary sinus thickening with bony destruction and enhancement across branches of the facial nerve and trigeminal nerve point to the possibility of invasive fungal infection that has spread along the nerve pathways. Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) is a severe fungal infection that often affects immunocompromised patients, such as those with uncontrolled diabetes or undergoing immunosuppressive treatments like chemotherapy. This condition often leads to bony destruction and perineural invasion, which would explain the facial nerve palsy in this case. While this is a formidable diagnosis, the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings fit the profile of invasive fungal sinusitis rather than maxillary carcinoma, schwannoma, or metastasis from an ovarian primary. The findings from the MRI brain also did not show any signs of metastasis, which further supports this diagnosis.
C
42
D: Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma)

Explanation: The clues come from the histology description, which highlighted "acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules". This type of description is distinctive for amyloidosis, a disorder characterized by deposition of insoluble proteins in organs and tissues. Since this case seems to be isolated to the tongue, it would be best classified as 'Localized amyloidosis' or 'Amyloidoma'. Fibroma, Granular cell tumor and Median rhomboid glossitis (nodular variant) would be less likely given the histology description and clinical observation.
D
43
B: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm

Explanation: The physical examination, the hematologic profile (low hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count), and the histopathological findings with CD123 staining point to the diagnosis of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a rare and aggressive hematologic malignancy that commonly presents with cutaneous lesions in older adults. It often involves the bone marrow leading to cytopenias, as seen in this patient. This malignancy is characterized histopathologically by skin infiltrates of medium-sized blasts with fine chromatin, moderate cytoplasm, and an absence of prominent nucleoli. CD123 staining, which appears to be positive in the biopsy, is typically present in BPDCN.

C: Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome

Explanation: The clinical and histological findings correlate with Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. This is a variant of Sweet Syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. It is typically associated with hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, cancer treatment, and other infections. Symptoms include fever, leukocytosis, and painful erythematous skin lesions. Histologically, it is characterized by an intense infiltrate of mature neutrophils, but in the histiocytoid variant, the neutrophils appear as histiocyte-like cells, as seen in this patient. The main treatment is systemic corticosteroids and addressing the underlying cause.

45
D: Takayasu arteritis.

Explanation: The child's clinical manifestations and radiological findings are suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. This disease is a large vessel vasculitis characterized by inflammation of the aorta and its major branches, including the renal arteries, leading to narrowing, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. The child's headache could be due to the hypertension caused by the renal artery stenosis, while seizures and altered consciousness could result from hypertensive encephalopathy.

The renal artery stenosis, and subsequently renal hypertrophy, is likely resulting from the increased blood pressure and demand on the unaffected kidney. The hypertension can also explain the hypertensive retinopathy seen on the fundoscopic examination. 

In this case, Atherosclerosis (option B) generally affects older adults, Fibromuscular dysplasia (option C) usually affects women, often young, and Moyamoya disease (option A) typically presents with a more distinctive imaging pattern on MRI with stenosis or occlusion of the distal internal carotid arteries and an abnormal vascular network. These are inconsistent with the child's age, gender, and clinical presentation. Therefore, Takayasu arteritis is the most likely diagnosis.
D

46
B: Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies. 

Explanation: The clinical findings in this patient are consistent with erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), likely mycosis fungoides. CTCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that presents in the skin but can progress to involve lymph nodes and internal organs. Features of CTCL include pruritus, erythroderma, and palmoplantar keratoderma, as seen in this patient. Given these symptoms, obtaining a skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

47
C: Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care

Explanation: The patient's asymptomatic black tongue discoloration, in the absence of symptoms such as tongue pain or burning, is most effectively characterized as black hairy tongue (BHT). This condition is associated with elongation and hyperplasia of the filiform papillae and discoloration from chromogenic bacteria or yeast, dead epithelial cells, and food debris. The typical triggers include poor oral hygiene, dry mouth, smoking, and certain medications (eg, antibiotics, antipsychotics). Even though the condition can be alarming due to its appearance, BHT is benign. No testing is generally required, and the main treatment is reassurance along with improved oral hygiene, which may include gentle debridement with a toothbrush or tongue scraper. Antibiotics, such as the cefazolin used in this case, can disrupt the normal oral flora and contribute to BHT. Still, the antibiotic should not be discontinued, as the benefits of treating severe infections like this patient's septic arthritis and pyomyositis outweigh the risks of BHT.

48
B: Dermoid cyst

Explanation: The lesion described in the case study exhibits both ectodermal and mesodermal components, including a keratinizing squamous epithelium, pilosebaceous units (which include hair follicles, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous glands), adipose and fibrous tissue, and embedded salivary glands. This indicates a dermoid cyst, which is a benign congenital lesion that arises from the inclusion of epithelial and adnexal structures during the closure of the neural groove and body folds in the third to fifth weeks of embryogenesis. Such cysts commonly present as subcutaneous masses in the head and neck. Oropharyngeal cysts are rare, but when present, they often arise from Waldeyer ring, most commonly the tonsil. The presence of actinomycosis is secondary colonization and has no bearing on the primary pathology. In contrast to dermoid cysts, teratomas demonstrate tissue elements from all three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), hairy polyps are characteristically pedunculated with a hairy surface and squamous papillomas do not typically contain the histological elements described. 
C
49
C: Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation, recent medical history, and the severity of her symptoms, there is a high suspicion of endophthalmitis which is a severe eye infection that can cause blindness if not quickly treated. Obtaining a sample for culture and sensitivity would be the next step in confirming this diagnosis and guiding the most effective treatment. Based on the patient's compromised immune system (due to the treatment of the AML), it is important to promptly start empiric antibiotic coverage after obtaining specimens for culture. Additionally, the recent extraction of the PICC line could have predisposed her to a systemic infection that seeded the eye. Therefore, option C would be the most appropriate next step in her care.

C

Explanation: The girl’s presentation of alternating nystagmus, cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes are clinical signs suggestive of a genetic or metabolic origin. Despite a normal MRI result, her ocular history points towards a probable congenital disorder where the disorder manifests since birth. Hence, ordering a genetic workup (option C) is particularly useful to pinpoint the exact origin of the disease. This would lead to a more specific treatment plan. Other options may deal with symptoms or random guesses, but the choice C gets to the root cause and is therefore most appropriate.
B: Pyoderma gangrenosum

Explanation: Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon, ulcerative cutaneous condition of uncertain etiology. It is associated with systemic diseases in up to 50% of patients, which makes it a diagnosis of exclusion. This is highly plausible in the case of our patient whose lab results eliminated other potential diseases such as Leukemia cutis, Leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and Lymphomatoid papulosis. Despite the fact that the isolated deletion of the 5q in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been linked with more favorable prognostic features when compared with other types of MDS, patients with this abnormality have been recognized to demonstrate a susceptibility towards neutrophilic dermatoses. Furthermore, our patient's skin lesions align with characteristics typical of pyoderma gangrenosum including multiple nonhealing ulcers and neutrophils that are present in a skin biopsy.

52
B: Genetic testing 

Explanation: Given the patient's long-standing history of kidney disease, proteinuria since childhood, and the unusual optic disc appearance in both eyes, genetic testing for renal-retinal syndromes would be a reasonable next step. These syndromes, such as Senior-Loken syndrome, are associated with nephronophthisis and unusual optic disc appearance like the one described. Although the optic changes could be due to the tacrolimus therapy, these are usually bilateral and symmetric, which one isn't in this case. Vasculitic optic neuropathy (option C) is usually associated with systemic symptoms and would not explain the kidney disease. While imaging (option A and D) may be useful, it would likely be a later step after genetic testing.
B

53
A: Symplastic glomus tumor.

Explanation: The presence of a bright pink, dome-shaped lesion with overlying vessels on the scalp suggests a vascular or perivascular tumor. These findings, in conjunction with the histopathologic examination showing dermal-based tumor cells arranged in a nodular configuration, scattered mitosis, necrosis and positive smooth muscle actin staining, are characteristic of a symplastic glomus tumor. Presence of symptoms such as tenderness also supports this diagnosis. While the other options also involve neoplasms of vascular or perivascular origin, they do not align as closely with the clinical picture and histopathologic findings in this case.
D

54
D: Microvenular hemangioma. 

Explanation: The overall descriptions and histopathological findings of the patient's lesions - multiple slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques with occasional slight pain, the presence of irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels with plump endothelial cells dispersed between thickened collagen bundles without signs of atypia, and CD31 positive endothelial cells - are more consistent with Microvenular hemangioma. These benign vascular proliferations often occur in young adults and manifest as solitary or multiple slowly progressive erythematous-violaceous plaques or nodules. The absence of signs of systemic involvement and other findings rule out Patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma, Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, and Acquired progressive lymphangioma. Furthermore, none of these choices typically present with similar histopathological features seen in this patient. Hence, the most accurate diagnosis in this case would be a Microvenular hemangioma.

55
B: Discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid.

Explanation: In this case, the man has developed acute respiratory distress following PCI with placement of drug-eluting stents. Also, amiodarone is used to control arrhythmias, but a well-known adverse effect is amiodarone-induced pneumonitis, which could be causing these symptoms. The chest radiograph and CT findings are suggestive of an interstitial lung disease, a known complication of amiodarone. So, the most reasonable next step is to discontinue amiodarone and initiate treatment with corticosteroids. Checking the amiodarone plasma level (D) will not affect management because toxic effects can occur at any plasma concentration. A lung biopsy (A) is typically reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain after less invasive testing. Bronchoalveolar lavage (C) would also be an invasive procedure that may not be necessary given the clinical context and should be reserved for unclear cases.
B

56
B: Perform provocative drug testing with procainamide

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as syncope, frequent PVCs and episodes of PVT, suggest a possible ventricular arrhythmia. The presence of short-coupled PVCs triggering PVT is suggestive of a specific kind of ventricular tachycardia (VT) called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) which is often sensitive to medications. As such, initial treatment often includes sodium channel blockers, such as procainamide, which is used here as a provocative drug test to confirm the diagnosis. Implanting a defibrillator (A), starting nadolol (C), or ablating the PVCs (D) could be considered as potential next steps after diagnosis confirmation. However, the provocative drug test will give more information about the patient's response to treatment with antiarrhythmic medication and is therefore generally considered before these more invasive procedures.

57
D: Plan for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Explanation: This patient’s hypotension, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte abnormalities are likely due to sepsis secondary to gallstone ileus, with possible perforation and peritonitis. She appears to be in shock, indicated by hypotension and tachycardia. Gallstones can become lodged in the ileus, leading to bowel obstruction. Non-operative therapies, such as nasogastric decompression, are generally insufficient for gallstone ileus and risk perforation with barium administration. Stabilization in the ICU with fluid resuscitation, antibiotic administration, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities is necessary to optimize the patient's condition prior to emergent surgical intervention to remove the obstructing stone. Endoscopic stone removal is typically not feasible due to the size of the stones in gallstone ileus and surgical intervention is often necessary to treat the condition.

58
B: Obtain a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens.

Explanation: The clinical history of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and small intestinal inflammation on computed tomography scan suggests an infectious etiology. The petechial rash can represent a cutaneous manifestation of sepsis secondary to disseminated bacterial infection. Given her living context and farming background, the patient may be exposed to various zoonotic pathogens, hence B: obtain a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens is recommended considering her existing symptoms. While ANCA level is important in the diagnosis of vasculitis, there are no strong signs pointing towards vasculitis in this case. The patient's blood cultures already grew K.pneumoniae, which makes fungal infection less likely. Checking of stool for ova and parasites can also be done but isn't the immediate next step based on the presented symptoms and history.

59
B: Multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient is experiencing CMV retinitis, which is a severe ocular complication of systemic CMV infection. Traditional treatment approaches with antiviral drugs have failed, and the patient is experiencing side effects from systemic immunosuppression. This, in conjunction with the finding of high CMV titers in the eyeball and resistance to antiviral therapy, indicates a poorly controlled systemic CMV infection, which places the patient at risk for further ocular and systemic complications. In this context, option B, the use of multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), seems most appropriate. CTLs have been effectively used in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients for the control of refractory CMV infections. It is expected that the use of CTLs in this case would not only potentially control the CMV retinitis but also help to control the systemic CMV viremia. Option A, additional systemic therapy, would be less effective given the resistance. Option C, continued intravitreal injections, would not likely provide a long-term solution and the patient is unable to tolerate them. Option D may not be powerful enough to control the resistant virus and there is a risk of additional side effects.

B: High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin. 

Explanation: The provided clinical context and pathological findings suggest that the primary site of carcinoma is more likely to be of gynecological origin. The patient's history of hysterectomy and prolonged use of estradiol, combined with the high-grade adenocarcinoma being positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, PAX8, p53, and WT1, which are markers often positively expressed in gynecological malignancies, supports this diagnosis. Furthermore, the lack of any detectable breast lesions or abnormalities on mammography and the negative ERBB2 (HER-2) and GATA3, which are often positive in breast carcinomas, seems to exclude the possibility of a primary breast carcinoma. The tumor being negative for Thyroid Transcription Factor (TTF) rules out a thyroid origin. The overall findings are in favor of a high-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin with axillary lymph node metastasis. The exact primary site within the gynecological system would be difficult to ascertain due to the patient's previous hysterectomy. The suggested diagnosis needs to be confirmed through further diagnostic procedures and careful clinical examination.

C: Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant

Explanation: The presence of a yellowish mass in the location specified, along with the ultrasound features and the finding of normal epidermis, pilosebaceous follicles, adipose tissue, and cartilage, is most consistent with a cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. This is a rare congenital malformation and typically presents as an isolated anomaly on the lateral neck. In contrast to this, a branchial cleft cyst would typically be located slightly higher in the neck and would be cystic, whereas an epidermoid cyst would not typically contain cartilage. Lastly, a hair follicle nevus would be more superficial and would not typically be associated with cartilage.
C
62
C: Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst

Explanation: The clinical presentation and surgical pathology findings are most consistent with a soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC). This diagnosis is further supported by the positive finding for the USP6 locus rearrangement, which is common in these types of cysts. ABCs are benign cystic lesions that usually occur in the long bones and vertebrae, though they can also occur in the soft tissue, like in this case. Despite being benign, ABCs are locally aggressive and may cause bone erosion, destruction, or expansion. They often contain multiple blood-filled spaces separated by connective tissue septa, features that were noted in the pathological examination of this case. Furthermore, they can recur and may require surgical intervention, as in this patient.
C
63
C: Median raphe cyst

Explanation: Median raphe cysts are congenital lesions that can present anywhere on the midline of the penis. They typically present as solitary lesions but can be multiple. These cysts are often asymptomatic and patients usually seek medical advice due to cosmetic concerns or symptoms such as pain, infection, or voiding difficulties. In this case, the sonographic features of a median raphe cyst typically show hypoechoic or anechoic, well-circumscribed lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement.

64
B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence

Explanation: Given the rapid onset and distribution of the bullae, the diagnosis should be confirmed with a skin biopsy for both histopathology and direct immunofluorescence. Although there are several potential causes of bullae (ie, vesicles >5 mm) in patients with diabetes, including bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, the rapid onset of widespread blisters in the absence of surrounding inflammation is suggestive of bullous diabeticorum or diabetic bulla. Diabetic bullas are typically self-limited and often resolve without specific treatment or with better glucose control. However, the lesions are at risk for secondary infection and should therefore be kept clean and monitored closely. If the blister is tense and causing discomfort, aspiration with a sterile needle can alleviate symptoms without increasing the risk for infection. Use of systemic corticosteroids such as prednisone is generally avoided because they can worsen glucose control.

65
B: Commence high-dose corticosteroids

Explanation: The patient's sudden monocular vision loss alongside with her clinical and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis that primarily affects the branches of the external carotid artery. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold-standard diagnostic test, but initiation of high-dose corticosteroids should not be delayed while awaiting this procedure due to the risk of further vision loss. The cherry-red spot visualized on fundoscopy is not typical of GCA but suggests central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), which may occur secondary to arteritis. Although MRI could be useful for ruling out other potential causes for the findings (answer A), and empirical antibiotics might be started in a patient with suspected sinusitis (answer C), neither would be as critical as starting corticosteroids to protect the patient's remaining vision. Stroke consult (answer D) could be helpful for managing the CRAO, but it would not address the underlying arteritis.

66
D: Orbital biopsy. 

Explanation: Given the lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics and absence of other clear indications of infection, the possibility of a non-infectious inflammatory condition should be considered. This patient’s unusual presentation along with recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma raises concern for an alternative or secondary process. A biopsy would help yield a definitive diagnosis, including the likelihood of an orbital inflammatory pseudotumor or possible involvement by the known underlying malignancy. While antifungal therapy could be considered due to the immunocompromised status, there is currently no evidence of invasive fungal disease on multiple imaging modalities and examination. Likewise, starting corticosteroids could potentially worsen an infectious process. Therefore, an orbital biopsy to confirm the diagnosis would be the most beneficial next step.

67
D: Perform hemoglobin electrophoresis. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of loss of appetite, lethargy, nausea, malaise, as well as acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency following treatment with acetazolamide, suggest a possible case of hemolytic anemia. This is more likely because the patient is a Black man, and people of African descent are more prone to conditions like G6PD deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia when treated with sulfonamides like acetazolamide. Hemoglobin level and hematocrit have significantly decreased, also suggesting hemolysis. Thus, performing hemoglobin electrophoresis can help confirm the diagnosis and affect future management protocols. The other options do not address the apparent hematological crisis the patient is experiencing.

68
C: Medication hypersensitivity reaction. 

Explanation: This patient's worsening rash after starting capecitabine therapy is consistent with hand-foot syndrome (HFS), also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. HFS is a common cutaneous adverse effect of chemotherapy agents like capecitabine, characterized by erythematous and pruritic maculopapular eruptions on the palms and soles, which are the areas with the highest concentration of eccrine sweat glands. However, HFS can also rarely present with off-palm and off-sole eruptions, like in this case. The rash often appears within the first 6 weeks of therapy, which also fits this patient's timeline. Cutaneous metastasis usually presents as firm, skin-colored to erythematous nodules, like skin inflammatory diseases, this entity would typically involve the palms and soles, unlike in this patient. Discoid lupus erythematosus would also typically spare the palms and soles and would be an unlikely diagnosis in the absence of other systemic symptoms.

B

69
D: Granular cell tumor. 

Explanation: Granular cell tumor (also known as Abrikossoff tumor) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This uncommon neoplasm is most often found in the head and neck region, specifically in the tongue but can occasionally be encountered in the trachea or larynx. Histologically it is characterized by its large cells with granular cytoplasm. Despite a potentially alarming appearance and rapid growth, these tumors are generally benign. However, surgical removal is often necessary due to their ability to cause airway obstruction, as in this case. The other options such as Chondroma, Glomus tumor, and Schwannoma are less likely due to the specifics of the case and their general rare occurrence in the trachea.
C
70
A: Gorham-Stout disease

Explanation: The signs and symptoms, as well as the imaging findings, suggest Gorham-Stout disease. This is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of vascular channels that result in the progressive destruction and resorption of osseous matrix, leading to extensive osteolysis. In this case, this is evidenced by the osteolysis involving the temporal bone noted in the high-resolution computed tomography scan. Furthermore, the presence of the cerebrospinal fluid leak, hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells, and the suspected communication into the soft tissues of the neck, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Gorham-Stout disease also has been associated with Chiari malformation type 1, which was found in the patient. Lastly, the destruction process typically associated with Gorham-Stout disease often spares the otic capsule, a finding that also was noted in this case. Other potential diagnoses like Langerhans cell histiocytosis or Sarcoma do not align well with all the signs and symptoms and imaging findings presented. Cholesteatoma would usually present with more visible signs of ear infection.
A
71
B: Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia 

Explanation: Considering the patient's extensive history of long-term hydroxyurea therapy and slow development of symptoms over time, along with her history of non-melanoma skin cancer, the best diagnosis would be Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia. Hydroxyurea is a common treatment for Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and its long-term use has been associated with the development of cutaneous side effects, including squamous dysplasia. This condition often presents as painful, ulcerated plaques and papules, as seen in this patient. The other options, although considering the effects of hydroxyurea, do not fully align with the presented symptoms and patient's medical history.

72
D: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. 

Explanation: The patient's history, clinical manifestation, and histopathology are characteristic of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. This is a rare recessively inherited disease characterized by hyaline deposits within the skin, mucosa, and visceral organs, typically differentiated by the painlessness and slow growth of the nodules. The patient's history of consanguineous parents is also typical, as the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The symptoms developed at an early age, they have recurred and have been increasing with age, consistent with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The nodules were hard, non-tender, and pseudo-spherical, which is unlike the manifestations of Infantile myofibromatosis (tumors are usually tender), Mafucci syndrome (often includes skeletal abnormalities), or Lipoid proteinosis (not typically manifesting as hard nodules).

73
C: Start intravenous magnesium 

Explanation: The correct answer is C: Start intravenous magnesium. Although the patient's magnesium level was 1.7 mg/dL which is on the lower intervention threshold, the patient had multiple episodes of Torsades de Pointes. Torsade de pointes is a type of ventricular tachycardia associated with prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which can be further exacerbated by certain medications, including metoprolol. Magnesium sulfate is the mainstay of therapy for Torsade de Pointes, even in patients with normal serum magnesium levels. The administration of intravenous magnesium is believed to reduce the occurrence of this arrhythmia by decreasing the inward L-type calcium current at the level of the ventricular myocyte, thereby decreasing the duration of the action potential and repolarization. The other options such as discontinue metoprolol, start sotalol or amiodarone, and emergent implantable cardioverter defibrillator implant could be possible future steps but not the immediate next step in management.

74
D: 100% Oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position.

Explanation: The sudden onset of dyspnea, retrosternal chest pain, hypotension, but preserved oxygen saturation suggests an acute circulatory failure. Pericardiocentesis (option A) would be appropriate if there were signs of cardiac tamponade or massive pericardial effusion, but these are not evident in this case. Given that the problems arose during the procedure and not before, thrombolysis (option B) and catheter-directed thromboembolectomy (option C) are less plausible. This patient might be experiencing a vagal reaction, air embolism, or acute mitral regurgitation. In this acute setting, it would be best to immediately initiate supportive treatments: 100% Oxygen to maximize saturation, intravenous fluids to compensate the potential decrease in blood pressure, and a Trendelenburg position to improve cerebral perfusion (option D). Thus, the answer is D.
D

75
C: Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction. 

Explanation: The patient's prolonged usage of corticosteroid eye drops would have suppressed her immune response, increasing the likelihood of a fungal infection. The fact that on examination, there are 2+ cells in the anterior chamber and 1+ vitritis, which could suggest inflammation or infection. In such cases, it's very important to rule out infectious causes. Furthermore, fungal infections are often chronic and persistent, similar to the history this patient presents with. This is why obtaining aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would be the recommended next step. PCR is a highly sensitive method for identifying fungal organisms.

76
C: Angiosarcoma. 

Explanation: Given his history of intensive radiation therapy, chronic graft vs host disease, and long-term systemic corticosteroids, the patient has multiple risk factors for developing secondary angiosarcoma. This is a rare cancer that forms in the lining of the blood vessels and lymph vessels. This case of multiple, recurrent, bleeding, and friable nodules, that were resistant to targeted therapies in irradiated fields, is consistent with post-radiation angiosarcoma, a very aggressive variant of angiosarcoma linked to prior radiation therapy. The lack of response to antimicrobials also helps exclude infectious etiologies. Angiosarcomas are typically resistant to conventional therapies as in this case, further supporting the diagnosis.

77
C: IgG4-related disease

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and presence of nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates on orbital biopsy, combined with her elevated IgG4 levels, are highly suggestive of IgG4-related disease. This condition is a systemic fibro-inflammatory disorder that can affect various organs, including the orbit and sinuses, leading to mass-like lesions, swelling and pain. Although Graves' disease and sarcoidosis can also cause proptosis, these conditions do not typically present with symptoms of sinusitis and they were not supported by additional laboratory tests (normal thyroid-stimulating hormone and negative angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme). Invasive fungal sinusitis was also ruled out because there was no necrosis found and it typically presents in immunocompromised patients and is more acute in onset. Furthermore, the cultures only grew Staphylococcus aureus, which is a bacteria, not a fungus. The elevated IgG4 levels, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates on biopsy, and the family history of orbital swelling, all support the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.
C
78
B: Immunotherapy-related inflammation

Explanation: The patient presented redness and swelling at the tumor site, followed by the formation of a white head and subsequent drainage that stopped spontaneously, without correlated signs of infection such as fever, leukocytosis, or foul smell. Therefore, this is unlikely to be an infection and suppuration (option A). Also, failure to grow pathogens and the resolution of symptoms without antibiotics rule out a bacterial process. As for tumor progression (option C), this is unlikely because the patient successfully completed neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a tumor resection without complications. Allergic reactions (option D) typically manifest systemically or in skin areas away from the actual site of drug contact. In this case, however, the reaction is localized to the site of the tumor. In conclusion, these signs and symptoms are most likely due to immunotherapy-related inflammation (option B), a known potential side effect of immunotherapies.

B: Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor

Explanation: The painful blue-green color, persistence of the swelling, and the MRI signal characteristics with the lesion being centered in the subcutaneous soft tissue are consistent with a hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor. This rare neoplasm typically presents as a painful, slowly growing subcutaneous mass in the distal extremities. The blue-green color of the mass is due to the accumulation of hemosiderin, a pigment derived from the breakdown of red blood cells. This is consistent with the patient's long-term injury and observed bruise. Radiologic findings also typically depict soft tissue swelling. The other options are less likely as they differ in clinical, pathological, or radiologic characteristics.

C: Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER)

Explanation: The patient's recent radiotherapy, associated with the onset of the pruritic rash, the presence of numerous eosinophils on biopsy, and the lack of any other identifiable causes all point towards the diagnosis of EPPER. EPPER is a rare condition characterized by the occurrence of pruritic, polymorphic skin lesions during or after radiotherapy. It is distinct from radiation dermatitis, which tends to begin in the irradiated area soon after the start of radiotherapy. EPPER eruptions often begin outside the irradiated area and may spread to include the irradiated area later in the course. The condition is also associated with a peripheral eosinophilia, which is present in this case. It is also important to note that the patient denied any new medications or exposure to chemotherapy, imaging with intravenous contrast, or recent travel which could also cause a similar rash. Therefore, although other conditions could potentially cause a similar presentation, EPPER appears most consistent with the given clinical scenario.

D: Electrophysiology study.

Explanation: The patient's ECG and telemetry showed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia after sinus rhythm was restored. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilated right ventricle with reduced systolic function, as well as late gadolinium enhancement in the RV free wall, indicating scarring and tissue damage, which may predispose to arrhythmias. He also had nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on previous ECGs. These factors combined establish the need for further electrophysiological study to better understand the nature of his arrhythmias, map them, and devise a suitable management strategy. An electrophysiology study can provide important insights into the mechanisms of tachyarrhythmias, and guide therapeutic interventions such as ablation or device therapy. The other options, including the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, may be considered depending on the findings of the electrophysiology study, especially if life-threatening arrhythmias are identified.

D: Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the results of the investigations point towards Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. It is a rare disease characterized by inflammatory bone disorders that may be associated with skin changes. These can include pustulosis, acne, and pharyngitis which are all symptoms the patient is experiencing. Furthermore, the MRI revealing hyperostotic anterior osteophytes and abnormal enhancement of C1/C2 vertebrae are characteristic signs of this syndrome. Additionally, the elevated ESR and CRP suggest the presence of an inflammatory process but the lack of signs for infection or malignancy rule out diagnoses A, B, and C. Thus, making SAPHO syndrome the most likely diagnosis.

B: Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque

Explanation: The ulcerated white plaques on the soft palate could be indicative of various conditions, from infections to malignancies. It is necessary to perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque, as this will allow for histopathological examination - the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Other choices like serologic tests, prescribing antibiotics, or starting topical treatments may not address the root cause of the condition, especially in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis. Even though conditions like Treponema pallidum infection could be considered due to his reported sexual activity, it is not the only possible cause. Hence, the most appropriate next step would be a biopsy.

C: Positron emission tomography scan. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent dull pain, mixed cataract in both eyes, an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening, and a family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia, may suggest a potential neoplastic process, so a whole-body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan would be the ideal next step. This imaging modality can assist in identifying potential systemic malignancy and metastasis. Considering his family's history, it could be essential to rule out metastasis, even though his other clinical findings like Descemet folds and keratoconus are more commonly associated with non-neoplastic conditions.

A: Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics. 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of breast and kidney carcinoma along with the presentation of the ocular lesion, option A would be considered as the most appropriate next step of action. As the ocular lesion is new and suspicious, this could possibly indicate a metastatic cancer. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy would provide both cytology and cytogenic information, that could be crucial in confirming the diagnosis. This approach could provide necessary information to determine the genotype and phenotype of the tumor cells which can guide targeted therapeutic choices.

86
C: Inflammatory breast cancer

Explanation: The presentation of this case suggests that the patient is suffering from inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The rapidly progressive rash and swelling on the chest wall can characteristic of IBC. IBC is an aggressive but rare form of breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin. This can cause breast enlargement, skin changes, and a rash. The absence of classic symptoms such as itching, weeping, or discharge, and the histology findings from the punch biopsy also point towards IBC. Positive immunohistochemical staining for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8 is consistent with IBC, while negative staining for ER/PR, TTF-1 etc. reinforces the same. The PET-CT scan showing FDG-avid nodes in the axilla, internal mammary, and cervical chains suggests involvement of lymph nodes, which is common in IBC. Lastly, lack of associated symptoms or indicators, such as hepatitis or HIV, stray away from other potential diagnoses. Therefore, evidence is highly suggestive of inflammatory breast cancer.

A: Madelung disease 

Explanation: Madelung disease, also known as multiple symmetric lipomatosis, is a rare disorder characterized by the symmetric growth of adipose tissue in the head, neck, shoulders, and proximal upper extremity regions. Although benign, these growths can cause aesthetic concerns and functional problems, as seen in this case where the patient experienced solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing. The disease is more common in males around the age of 50-years-old, and often in individuals from Mediterranean descent. It is associated with alcohol use, though in this case, the patient did not report any alcohol use. The presentation of the lipomatous mass in this patient, its location, and the history of a similar mass treated with liposuction a decade prior, all point towards a diagnosis of Madelung disease.

88
C: Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus

Explanation: The patient's physical examination, presence of central small filiform keratotic white spicules and brown plugs, dermoscopy, and histopathologic findings are the typical features of porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN). PEODDN is a rare nonhereditary skin disorder that usually becomes apparent at birth or during early childhood. It is primarily characterized by multiple, small, firm, wart-like bumps (papules) that are often arranged in linear paths on the skin. In some cases, these papules may coalesce to form a hardened, thickened ridge of skin (hyperkeratotic plaques). The other conditions such as inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, trichodysplasia spinulosa and multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis lack some of the defining characteristics of PEODDN.

C: Langerhans cell histiocytosis. 

Explanation: The patient's multiple, recalcitrant, and painful ulcerations, yellowish scale on the scalp, nonhealing after multiple antibiotic treatments, and presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, parotid enlargement, polyuria, and polydipsia are all potential signs of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The histopathology examination showing atypical cells with characteristic grooved vesicular nuclei and positive CD1a in the lower epidermis and dermis reinforced this diagnosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease characterized by the proliferation of CD1a and langerin positive Langerhans-type cells. This presentation of nonhealing ulcers is atypical for the condition, but Langerhans cell histiocytosis can have various clinical presentations, making a definite diagnosis through histopathology necessary.

B: Pacemaker implantation

Explanation: Given the patient's recurrent presyncope, bradycardia with a heart rate sometimes less than 50 beats per minute, with symptoms not related to activity, and RBBB with LPFB (bifascicular block), a pacemaker needs to be considered. The most likely diagnosis here is symptomatic bradycardia due to tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (a type of sick sinus syndrome) in a patient with atrial fibrillation and bifascicular block. This case does not strongly suggest intermittent third-degree or second-degree Mobitz II atrioventricular block, which would also indicate pacemaker implantation. Ambulatory ECG monitoring (option A) might be a reasonable step if the diagnosis was unclear, but in this case, the recurrent presyncope and ECG findings strongly suggest the need for a pacemaker. An exercise treadmill test (option C) is not necessary given the patient’s stable ventricular response and the absence of ischemic symptoms. An electrophysiology study (option D) would not typically be used for diagnosing bradycardia or conduction system diseases. The main treatment for symptomatic bradycardia with consequential impairment of cardiac output is permanent pacemaker implantation.

D: Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy. 

Explanation: The clinical features and diagnostic testing of the patient point towards sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy. The presentation includes progressive proximal muscle weakness, camptocormia, dysphagia, and weight loss all of which are associated with this condition. Additionally, the muscle biopsy's finding of atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance align with the histologic features of nemaline rod myopathy. While the other conditions could potentially present with similar symptoms, they are less likely based on the specific clinical and histologic findings of this case.

B

Explanation: This patient's weight gain, hypertension, and snoring suggest obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a disorder of recurring episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep patterns. Major risk factors include obesity and male sex. Symptoms include sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, witnessed apnea, and nocturnal choking. Patients may also have associated conditions such as hypertension – as seen in this case, heart disease, stroke, and/or arrhythmias. Home sleep apnea testing is recommended for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pretest probability and without serious comorbidities. Given this patient's body mass index, reported snoring, hypertension, and age, she likely has severe OSA that would benefit from immediate treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. CPAP is the most effective nonsurgical treatment for OSA and can result in significant improvements in symptoms, quality of life, and blood pressure control.
B: Perform systemic workup, including chest imaging

Explanation: The patient's systemic symptoms such as severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, sinus congestion, and diffuse facial edema and erythema along with unilateral elevated intraocular pressure despite glaucoma surgery suggest a possible systemic condition that may have led to increased intraocular pressure. Thus, it is crucial to perform a systemic workup, including chest imaging, to rule out conditions such as sinusitis, carotid-cavernous fistula, thyroid-associated orbitopathy, or superior vena cava syndrome that might, directly or indirectly, cause elevated intraocular pressure. Discontinuing fluorometholone eye drops, adding netarsudil eye drops, or placing a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser may not address the systemic symptoms the patient is experiencing and thus may not be the most appropriate initial steps.

D: Perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's worsening symptoms, despite use of antibiotics, indicate the progression of whatever is causing the proptosis, thus making it necessary to conduct an invasive procedure such as a biopsy, which will allow for direct examination of the intraconal mass. An orbital exploration with lesion biopsy will not only aid in definitive diagnosis but also could provide immediate relief from the mass effect. Immediate alleviation of the mass would potentially help prevent further damage, particularly to the patient's vision, which has been progressively worsening. Other options like further testing or high-dose steroids might not address the issue promptly or directly enough. Therefore, performing an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy is the most appropriate next step in management.

A: Rosai-Dorfman disease

Explanation: The histiocytes with central nucleoli and emperipolesis (a condition where a cell engulfs another without causing cell death), seen in the hematoxylin-eosin stained lymph node specimen, are typical characteristics for Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD). Furthermore, the immunohistochemical staining being positive for S100 and negative for CD1a supports this diagnosis. RDD, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare benign disorder characterized by overproduction of histiocytes (type of immune cell) that often presents with sinus and lymph node involvement, as in this case. Castleman disease generally presents with fever, night sweats, and laboratory abnormalities. Inflammatory pseudotumor lacks the emperipolesis characteristic of RDD. Sarcoidosis, which commonly affects the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes, is typically marked by non-caseating granulomas, which was not observed in this case. Hence, based on the clinical presentation, hospital course, and pathological findings, RDD seems the most appropriate diagnosis.

96
A: Oral hairy leukoplakia

Explanation: The patient's presentation and biopsy results lead us towards the diagnosis of Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL). OHL is a condition caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The presence of bilateral raised lesions on the tongue that exhibit a slightly hairy appearance, the fact that they cause pain in the face of spicy food, and the fact that they do not scrape off are indicative of OHL. Furthermore, the biopsy shows prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, which is characteristic of viral infections like EBV. The other conditions listed may also cause oral lesions but are not as consistent with the patient's presentation and histological findings.
C
97
C: Optical coherence tomography

Explanation: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. It can provide detail about the structure of the retina and detect irregularities or changes, which would be useful in this case - the patient is reporting visual disturbances and examination has revealed irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. Although the other options could potentially provide useful information, OCT is likely the next best step given the specific findings in this case.

98
B: Loose anagen syndrome.

Explanation: Loose anagen syndrome is characterized by easily plucked (loose) anagen hairs due to poor adhesion of the hair shaft to the inner root sheath. The condition often presents in early childhood with complaints of sparse hair, which does not grow long. The typical findings on examination include short, sparse hair that lacks luster, often with no evidence of areas of alopecia, inflammation, or scarring. Hair pull test is positive with shedding of anagen phase hair. The condition is frequently seen in fair-haired individuals, but may also affect those with dark hair. Other conditions for comparison, like Short Anagen Syndrome is a condition in which the anagen phase of hair growth is shorter than normal, leading to short hair that grows slower. But in this case, there are no reported hair structural abnormalities, which rules out this condition. Trichodental dysplasia and Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp both have hair abnormalities with association to abnormalities with teeth and/or development delay, which is not observed in the given case. Hence, Loose anagen syndrome is the most fitting diagnosis considering the given symptoms and findings.

C: Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis

Explanation: The clinical characteristics of this case, including the rapid onset, severe pruritus, the pattern and distribution of lesions, as well as the absence of involvement of the palms, soles, and mucosa, and negative laboratory findings, make eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis the most likely diagnosis. This condition is characterized by well-defined, annular, keratotic papules that can be intensely itchy and usually occurs on the trunk and extremities. The other conditions listed, while sharing some similar features, do not encompass all the specifics of this case. For example, annular lichen planus typically occurs in adults and often involves the oral mucosa; granuloma annulare lesions typically are asymptomatic; and pityriasis rosea usually presents with a "herald patch" and follows a specific pattern on the body, none of which are indicated in this case.

C: Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiate cascade screening and high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily.

Explanation: The patient is at an extreme risk due to elevated Lp(a) levels, strong family history of premature ASCVD, and high coronary calcium scores. Though he doesn't have any traditional risk factors, his non-modifiable risk factors put him in a unique population that may benefit from intense risk-reduction strategies. 
Lifestyle modifications should always be encouraged, but they alone might not be sufficient in this case. Some evidence suggests statin therapy may help to lower Lp(a) levels and aspirin is recommended for individuals at high risk of ASCVD for its antiplatelet effect. A combination approach ensures that his risk factors are managed comprehensively. 
Cascade screening of first-degree relatives can also be beneficial considering the strong family history. Initiating PCSK9 inhibitor therapy isn't a first-line approach yet due to the need for more clinical trials to demonstrate its efficacy in reducing clinical endpoints and due to its high cost. Though these agents can reduce Lp(a) levels, it's unclear if this translates to a reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality.

C: Niemann-Pick disease type C. 

Explanation: The findings of a slowly progressive ataxia, cognitive impairment, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and absent stretch reflexes are a typical presentation of adult-onset Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). The MRI features further tip the diagnosis towards NPC. Friedreich ataxia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and is characterized by areflexia and loss of vibration and position senses. Although her MRI shows cerebellar atrophy, a cardinal imaging feature of fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), her absence of a personal or family history of intellectual disability or premature ovarian failure does not support a diagnosis of FXTAS. Features suggesting mitochondrial diseases include exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis, and strokes. But in her case, there are no such symptoms. NPC is a cholesterol storage disorder and treatment with miglustat can help delay onset of neurologic symptoms. The patient's anxiety, severe fear of falling, and cognitive impairment are highly suggestive of the neuro-psychiatric elements often present in NPC.

C

Explanation: 
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). ACNES is a frequently missed diagnosis that is one of the most common causes of chronic abdominal pain. It occurs due to the entrapment of cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves at the rectus abdominis muscle. Patients often present with localized, persistent abdominal pain at the site of nerve entrapment. The point of maximal tenderness is typically no larger than a fingertip and is positioned lateral to the midline. The pain may increase with certain position and activities that tense the abdominal muscles. To confirm ACNES, anesthetic blockade of the affected nerves is performed by injecting a local anesthetic to the area of maximal tenderness. Reduction or elimination of pain confirms the diagnosis. Therefore, answer choice C: inject a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness is the most appropriate next step.

B: Obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels

Explanation: The clinical scenario of a child presenting with persistent fever, cough, vesiculobullous skin lesions, and a picture of pneumonia on chest CT is highly suggestive of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known to cause a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations, including mucocutaneous involvement, which is seen in this child. The typical findings include vesiculobullous or erosive lesions on the palms and soles, targetoid lesions, and mucositis, which can involve oral, ocular, or genital mucosa. The first-line approach in a patient with suspected Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is to check Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels for diagnosis. The pathergy test for Behçet disease (Option A) is not commonly done, but might be appropriate if other signs of vasculitis were present. An echocardiogram (Option C) might be considered if there was concern about cardiac involvement which is not indicated here. Monkeypox virus (Option D) would be less likely given this child's clinical presentation and lack of exposure history.

A

Explanation: The presentation of severe abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid in a patient on PD typically signifies PD-associated peritonitis. In this patient, her inadvertent break in aseptic technique is a clear predisposing factor. PD peritonitis is a medical emergency due to the risk of serious complications, including formation of fibrinous exudates that can interfere with the adequacy of dialysis, loculated infections, sclerosing peritonitis, and involvement of the systemic circulation leading to sepsis. Unlike with other types of bacterial infections, culture results for PD-associated peritonitis can take several days. Therefore, waiting for PD fluid culture results would delay potentially life-saving antibiotics. Thus, initial treatment should not await these results. Instead, treatment should be started in all symptomatic patients with cloudy PD fluid. Broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics are administered initially until culture results are available. Compared with intravenous administration, intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics ensures high antibiotic concentrations in the peritoneal cavity, thus increasing effectiveness.
D: Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis. 

Explanation: After reviewing the patient's symptoms following the C5 anterior corpectomy and fusion surgery, the most probable diagnosis is delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis. The vocal fold issues began post-surgery, suggesting that the surgery might have directly or indirectly injured the recurrent laryngeal nerves, leading to vocal fold paralysis. Studies listed showed no indication of neurological or metabolic disease nor evidence of infection or abscess. The evidence of fixed vocal folds despite no recognized immediate postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is best compatible with a delayed-onset iatrogenic bilateral vocal cord paralysis. This case is a good reminder that surgical complications can still occur long after surgery and clinicians should remain vigilant.

A: Observation 

Explanation: The patient’s iris lesion reportedly had been stable for multiple decades, with a benign clinical appearance consisting of large surface pigment granules and mammillations and without prominent intrinsic vascularity, ectropion uvea, cataracts, or other worrisome features. As immediate intervention might not be necessary, it is reasonable to monitor the lesion over time due to its benign appearance and long-established stability. Further investigations or treatments like fine-needle aspiration biopsy, plaque brachytherapy, or iridectomy could be considered if there are changes in the future. By going with observation, the patient is saved from potential complications and the financial burden that can be associated with unnecessary procedures.

B: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis 

Explanation: The clinical presentation here is indicative of Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a rare Epstein-Barr virus–associated systemic B-cell lymphoproliferative disease involving predominantly extranodal sites, particularly the lungs and skin. This is supported by prominent lymphadenopathy, reciprocal CD8+ T-cell deficiency, and high loads of EBV DNA. The histopathological examination also reveals infiltration of lymphocytes with EBV, a characteristic of Lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Cutaneous manifestations of this disease include papules, plaques, nodules, or ulcerative lesions, which fit the patient's presentation. Other options are less likely. Cutaneous sarcoidosis doesn't usually present with atypical lymphocytes, and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is generally CD4-/CD56+, which was not observed here. Lastly, Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is rarely associated with high levels of EBV DNA.

C: Nodular amyloidosis

Explanation: The asymptomatic, slow-growing, yellowish plaques and verrucous lesions alongside the patient's history of gastric adenocarcinoma lead towards nodular amyloidosis as the most likely diagnosis. Nodular amyloidosis is a rare type of localized cutaneous amyloidosis characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in the skin or mucous membranes. Here, the tongue is involved. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of circumscribed eosinophilic, amorphous, fissured masses in the subepithelial connective tissue are typical of nodular amyloidosis. Other pathological entities mentioned in the choices do not usually involve the oral cavity, and their clinical and pathological features do not correspond to the formulation of the case provided. Therefore, nodular amyloidosis is the most likely diagnosis.

C: Perform coronary angiography

Explanation: 

The patient's presentation with recurrent chest pain at rest, elevated troponin T level, and specific ECG changes indicates a high likelihood of unstable angina or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), conditions that are considered acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients with suspected ACS require risk stratification to guide management; risk is determined by clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and noninvasive testing. Episodic chest pain at rest (often nocturnal), particularly with diaphoresis, is typical of unstable angina/NSTEMI. Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions may suggest ischemia.

In patients at high risk, such as in this patient with elevated troponin T level (due to myocardial necrosis), an early invasive management strategy (ie, coronary angiography within 24 hours) is indicated and has been shown to improve outcomes. Notably, risk stratification tools such as the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) scores can be used to help categorize patients as low, intermediate, or high risk.

In addition, the patient's continued smoking increases the risk for CAD, which is further heightened because of his elevated LDL cholesterol level. Strategies for smoking cessation and initiation of high-intensity statin therapy should be considered.

B: Transconjunctival orbital biopsy

Explanation: Given the recurrent episode of hemorrhage, the nonreducible and nonpulsatile proptosis, and the progression despite corticosteroid treatment, this case raises concern for a neoplastic etiology. Therefore, the assessment of any recurrent orbital hemorrhage requires a comprehensive approach that includes a detailed history, physical examination, and diagnostic evaluation. In this case, a biopsy is required to definitively diagnose and plan treatment. With histopathological examination, it would be possible to identify any neoplastic cells or to determine any other causes for the recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage. The histopathologic diagnosis is crucial in this case to identify the underlying cause of the hemorrhage and to propose an appropriate treatment plan.

B: Initiate an alternative systemic therapy (ie, an immunomodulatory agent)

Explanation: This patient's condition appears to be refractory to high-dose oral prednisone and topical corticosteroids, which suggests an inflammatory etiology resistant to traditional anti-inflammatory treatment. The presence of an episcleral nodule that is elevated and tender also indicates a likely inflammatory process. Given her history of RDD disease, it's plausible that the ongoing inflammation may be an extension of this disease or a separate autoimmune disorder presenting in the eye. Hence, an immunomodulatory therapy may be necessary to control the inflammation and prevent further deterioration of her vision. The other options are less ideal: switching NSAIDs is unlikely to yield results since she did not respond to ibuprofen; intra-arterial melphalan is usually reserved for malignant conditions and its use here may be over-aggressive; while subtenon triamcinolone might provide temporary relief, it does not address the underlying cause. Thus, starting an immunomodulatory agent is the next best step in this patient's treatment.

B: Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass 
Explanation: This approach may be the most effective choice based on the patient's refusal for an orbital exenteration and the potential for immunotherapy to respond well to the disease. Cetuximab treatment and platinum-based chemotherapy could also be options but may have less effect on overall survival. Palliative radiotherapy may not fully address the problems given the current extent of the disease. Neoadjuvant cemiplimab may aid in decreasing tumor mass before surgery and save the globe via a sparing orbitotomy. Also, surgical excision would allow a definitive histological diagnosis and grading to guide further management.

C: Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane.

Explanation: Given the unusual presentation of a pigmented membrane and the patient’s history of melanoma, the pigmented epiretinal membrane raises the concern for possible ocular melanoma, despite her original tumor staging showing no evidence of metastasis. To confirm the diagnosis, a pars plana vitrectomy with excisional biopsy of the membrane can provide definitive pathological diagnosis. The use of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is more typically indicated for treatment for the choroidal neovascularization rather than the membrane itself. Observation alone might lead to progression of any underlying disease while prescribing steroids without a confirmed inflammatory etiology could potentially exacerbate any infectious or neoplastic processes.

B: Immunotherapy-related gastritis

Explanation: The patient's onset of symptoms corresponds with the timing of her immunotherapy treatment, suggesting a probable association. There is a lack of signs indicating viral, bacterial or other infectious causes based on the biopsy samples which tested negative for common pathogens like H. pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus. While chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with portal hypertensive gastropathy, the absence of associated features such as blood in vomit or stool make this less likely. Also, progression of the liver cancer seems improbable given the patient's normal α-fetoprotein (AFP) level and the normal appearance of the liver on imaging. Therefore, this case most likely presents immunotherapy-related gastritis triggered by her treatment with nivolumab. Immunotherapy-related adverse events can manifest in various forms and depending on the organ, including inflammation of the gastric mucosa as seen in this patient.

B: Osteoma. 

Explanation: Osteoma is a benign tumor that can occur in the ear. Given the patient's otoscopic examination results and CT scan, the mass in the ear is described as a calcareous, lobular mass which is hard upon palpation, these are characteristics consistent with osteoma. Features such as a hyperdense mass seen on the CT scan also leans towards a diagnosis of osteoma. Cholesteatomas are usually associated with chronic otitis media, tympanosclerosis often includes history of recurrent ear infections and Tophaceous gout is usually associated with chronic gout, which the patient has not reported.

117
B: Foregut duplication cyst. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are suggestive of a foregut duplication cyst. These are congenital anomalies that can cause airway and esophageal obstruction. They are typically located in the mediastinum and often present in childhood with symptoms such as stridor, dysphagia, or respiratory distress caused by compression of the trachea or esophagus. The radiologic presentation of these cysts is usually as a well-circumscribed, round, or oblong mass with homogenously low density on CT scans, and as an echogenic mass on ultrasonography, similar to the findings in this case. The location of this lesion along the trachea and esophagus is also typical for a foregut duplication cyst. Other suggested diagnoses like thymic cyst, hemangioma, or lymphatic malformation usually present with different symptoms or imaging characteristics. 
B
118
B: Epidermoid cyst

Explanation: This diagnosis is based on the clinical, radiographical, and histopathological findings. The epidermoid cyst is a benign, slow-growing cutaneous or subcutaneous lesion that can occur anywhere in the body, but is especially common in areas with numerous hair follicles like the face, neck, and trunk. Its pathology is characterized by a keratin-filled cyst lined with stratified squamous epithelium and the potential presence of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. This corresponds with the cyst in our patient that had been present since birth, slowly grown in size, found in the postauricular region (a common site), and displayed features on histopathology characteristic of an epidermoid cyst. Other differential diagnoses such as pilomatricoma, type 1 first branchial cleft cyst, and hemangioma lack consistencies with the patient's presentation and histopathological findings.
C
119
B: Laryngeal sarcoidosis 

Explanation: The diagnosis is laryngeal sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a non-caseating granulomatous disease that can affect any organ, though the lungs and lymph nodes are most commonly involved. Laryngeal involvement is rare but can present with symptoms similar to this patient's. The presence of non-necrotizing granulomas on biopsy is a key diagnostic criterion. Laryngopharyngeal reflux usually shows signs of reflux esophagitis on esophagram and granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically presents with systemic vasculitis, which this patient does not have. Laryngeal tuberculosis would typically present with other systemic signs of tuberculosis, such as cough or night sweats and the granulomas would show caseating necrosis, unlike the granulomas in this patient. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate often occurs in sarcoidosis due to systemic inflammation.

D: Pemphigoid nodularis. 

Explanation: Pemphigoid nodularis is a rare variant of bullous pemphigoid (BP) and is often misdiagnosed as nodular prurigo, especially when bullae are absent. It is characterized by intense pruritus and the formation of persistent nodules. In this case, the patient had generalized nodules and pruritic papulonodular skin lesions, which are common manifestations of pemphigoid nodularis. Furthermore, direct immunofluorescence from a biopsy specimen demonstrated linear deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) along the basement membrane zone, a classic sign of pemphigoid diseases. Thus, these clinical and histological features lead to the diagnosis of pemphigoid nodularis. Nevertheless, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect BP180 and BP230 antibodies can be performed to further confirm the diagnosis.

D: Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma.

Explanation: The background of early onset, rapid growth, ulceration, and bleeding from numerous vascular papules, coupled with the distinctive histopathological features, supports the diagnosis of congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma (CDPG). This diagnosis is further supported by the lack of either fever, hepatosplenomegaly, or bacteremia, which argues against bacillary angiomatosis. The lack of thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding rules out multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia. Meanwhile, multifocal infantile hemangiomas generally present with numerous obvious clinical characteristics, such as the size and location of the lesions, which were not reported in this case. Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and the timing and characteristics of the lesions, the diagnosis of congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is most fitting.

D: Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve.

Explanation: Despite a number of evaluations yielding normal results, the patient's symptoms and findings on examination are most suggestive of a neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve. The nerve can be compressed or irritated by surrounding vascular structures, leading to oculomotor dysfunction. Neither Myasthenia gravis nor Holmes Adie pupil fit the presentation, especially since tests for autoimmune conditions were negative. A Posterior communicating artery aneurysm not discerned by CT angiography could be a possible diagnosis, but these usually present with painful ophthalmoplegia, and the patient's symptoms are clearly painless. However, one cannot fully exclude this diagnosis without a more detailed evaluation of the vascular structures but neurovascular conflict seems more likely considering the symptomatology.

123
D: Administer oral acyclovir. 

Explanation: The presentation suggests a viral infection possibly molluscum contagiosum or herpes simplex virus (HSV). Molluscum contagiosum presents as small, pearly, dome-shaped nodules with a central umbilication, but typically does not manifest with erythema or systemic symptoms, which makes it less likely. HSV, on the other hand, can cause gingivostomatitis with sore throat, painful swallowing, preauicular/submandibular lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise and vesicular skin lesions about the face (including eyelids), which seems to align better with the patient's presentation. As ocular HSV infections can cause keratoconjunctivitis and possible corneal infection resulting in visual impairment if left untreated, it is important to start early treatment. Hence, oral acyclovir should be administered. Other interventions such as performing lesion excision by unroofing and curettage may be too invasive at this stage but can be considered later if necessary. Although notifying the public health authorities is done in case of certain infectious diseases, immediate isolation may not be needed unless it is confirmed to be a highly contagious infection.

A: Order orbital magnetic resonance imaging 

Explanation: Given the presentation of a white retinal lesion with calcification, it is crucial to rule out the possibility of a malignant intraocular tumor such as retinoblastoma, which could lead to vision loss or metastasis if untreated. While genetic testing could provide useful information if a hereditary retinoblastoma is suspected, and ruling out infectious diseases may be helpful information, the priority in this case should be to establish a definitive diagnosis and assess the extent of the lesion. An orbital magnetic resonance imaging would help identify any possible invasion of the optic nerve or post-laminar optic nerve involvement, which is critical in guiding the treatment plan moving forward. Biopsy of the lesion should be avoided as it could disseminate tumor cells into the vitreous or subretinal space, refractory to commonly used treatment strategies.

125
B: Genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases

Explanation: The presentation outlined in the case suggests a rare hereditary ocular pathology that could possibly involve abnormalities in retinal structure such as retinal dystrophies and degenerations. In such cases, genetic testing might be crucial in identifying the root cause of the issue. The other options do not appear as informative as a next step. A B-scan ultrasonography would not offer much information regarding the abnormal foveal contour and likely wouldn't identify the pathology in the retinal pigment epithelium. Observation alone does not offer a proactive approach towards an underlying diagnosis. The fundus autofluorescence might revel some anomalies in retinal pigments but it does not provide precise information about a genetic disorder. Hence, genetic testing seems the most appropriate next step here.

126
C: Observation
Explanation: The patient’s history of endophthalmitis treated with intravitreal antibiotics, followed by subsequent clearing of the vitreous haze, suggests that the bacteria causing her condition (in this case, Staphylococcus caprae) was sensitive to the antibiotics used. Notably, the white retinal lesions improved with a topical steroid, pointing to a likely inflammatory rather than infectious origin. Although the option of a vitrectomy with biopsy could provide additional data, the risk associated with the procedure and the likelihood of an inflammatory reaction makes observation a logical choice. It would be essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of recurring or worsening infection or inflammation.

127
B: Injection of subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms and the unique physical findings, this case is suspicious for an ocular parasitic infestation, possibly caused by a species associated with farm animals, such as Thelazia callipaeda (a nematode parasitic eye worm). This organism is prevalent in Eastern Europe, especially in rural areas, and can be transmitted by face flies from dogs, cats, or cattle to humans. Injecting subconjunctival lidocaine would numb the area and surgical removal would ensure the parasite, if present, is removed, providing significant relief to the patient. On the other hand, options A and D, which include local and systemic drug therapies, may not directly target the possible cause of the lesion. Sending the lesion for flow cytometry as in option C will help confirm diagnosis but won't solve the problem immediately.

128
D: Solitary fibrous tumor.

Explanation: Solitary fibrous tumors are rare and may occur anywhere in the body. The histological diagnosis is primarily based on the presence of spindle cells in patternless architecture, often with thick, hyalinized collagen bands. The immunohistochemistry assays usually reveal positivity for CD34 and STAT6, due to a NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion which is characteristic for these tumors. However, this case showed negative results for CD34. It is important though to remember that STAT6 is more reliable since CD34 can be lost in some solitary fibrous tumor variants. Therefore, with the case presenting with diffuse positivity for STAT6, it is suggestive of a diagnosis of Solitary fibrous tumor.
D
129
A: Facial nerve schwannoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation, age, progressive course over the years, associated congenital facial palsy, lack of vestibular symptoms, and radiological findings of enlargement and enhancement of the facial nerve are consistent with a facial nerve schwannoma. The MRI and CT scan findings showing an intratemporal specious mass developed at the expense of facial nerve also points towards this diagnosis. While the other cases could have similar presentations, they don't fit as well in this clinical context. For example, a vestibular schwannoma would typically affect the balance or cause vertigo. Neuromuscular choristomas are usually diagnosed in childhood and do not typically present with progressive hearing loss. Hemangiomas are typically not associated with nerve enlargement or involvement.
C
130
C: Coccidioidomycosis

Explanation: This diagnosis is largely driven by the geographical and travel history of the patient, and the clinical presentation of the draining facial abscess. Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, is a fungal infection endemic to certain areas, especially the Southwestern United States and parts of Central and South America. The infection is caused by the Coccidioides species of fungi. The lesions described, as well as the response to therapy and lack of other symptoms, suggest coccidioidomycosis. Although unusual, cutaneous coccidioidomycosis can occur and may present as chronic, non-healing skin abscesses or ulcers. The patient's history of living in Southern California and traveling to Kenya is consistent with possible exposure to this fungus. The negative tissue culture result does not rule out this diagnosis, as fungal cultures often take longer and need specific media for growth. Pyoderma gangrenosum, Lupus vulgaris, and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically have different clinical presentations and would not likely present in this way.

131
B

Explanation: The patient is in a relatively stable hemodynamic state and the rhythm is a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with changeable intraventricular conduction, which is most likely due to an accessory pathway. Adenosine administration was helpful in identifying the presence of atrial tachycardia. Given these findings, acting quickly to control the heart rate is critical. A temporary pacing wire would provide heart rate control and cardio protection while definitive treatment is organised. The use of amiodarone can further help in rate control and in converting to sinus rhythm. The administration of low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended to prevent thromboembolic events. Option B also allows time to order an electrophysiologic investigation, which can be helpful in ruling out other causes for SVT before proceeding with DC shock. Therefore, a combination of treatments would both control the heart rate and prevent complications, which is essential given the patient's history and presentation.
D: Eosinophilic fasciitis 

Explanation: The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and results from the electromyography study all indicate a diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis. This condition is characterized by symmetrical, progressive stiffening and induration of the skin, typically involving the extremities with limitation of joint mobility. The “prayer sign” and the absence of Raynaud phenomenon, erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque all point away from systemic sclerosis. Lack of skin plaque also argues against deep morphea. Essential features for the diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis include an elevated eosinophil count in the peripheral blood (as seen in this case) and increased collagen deposition in deep muscle fascia biopsy. The electromyography findings are not distinctive but can instigate the further exploration for underlying musculoskeletal disorders. As there is no myotonia or muscular dystrophy suggested in the history present illness or physical examination, Myotonic disease is also less likely. Therefore, the most accurate diagnosis here would be eosinophilic fasciitis.

133
C: Restart daily oral itraconazole

Explanation: The patient's signs and presentations are indicative of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which includes persistent or recurrent infections with Candida species affecting the skin, nails, and mucous membranes. In this case, Candida albicans was found in the patient's skin scrapings which further supports this diagnosis. Oral itraconazole was used previously to successfully manage her condition. Therefore, the most appropriate step would be to restart daily oral itraconazole treatment (Option C). 

While cefazolin (Option A) and terbinafine (Option D) can be used to treat certain bacterial and fungal infections respectively, they're not typically effective against Candida species. Hydrocortisone cream (Option B) might help reduce inflammation and itching, but it will not treat the underlying fungal infection.

D: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit.

Explanation: Given the past medical history of this patient consisting of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer and previous bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis surgery, she is at a higher risk for developing growths or structural changes in and around her eyes. The patient's presentation of right-sided blurry vision, eye dryness, right upper eyelid retraction, right lagophthalmos with an incomplete blink, and 2-mm relative right enophthalmos could be potential signs of an orbital mass or tumour causing pressure or alteration of the eye socket structure. Therefore, a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit would be a logical next step, as this scan could provide high resolution images of the eye and surrounding tissues, crucial to assess the presence of any abnormalities or masses. This would help to verify or rule out any recurrence of previous conditions, or onset of new ones potentially causing these symptoms. The other options, while potentially useful in certain situations, are less relevant given the current symptoms and previous medical history.

135
C: Observation with close follow-up. 

Explanation: Given the patient’s stable clinical evaluation, absence of any risk factors for malignancy such as ectropion uveae, corectopia, or feeder vessels, an observation with close follow-up would be the most appropriate step. Despite a history of cutaneous melanoma, the lack of growth or extension of the lesion into the angle, as well as unremarkable UBM findings, suggest that immediate invasive procedures such as a corneal biopsy or surgical excision may not be necessary at this time. Prednisolone, which is primarily used for reducing inflammation, also does not seem to be indicated in this case. The plan of care should include regular monitoring of the pigmented lesion for any changes, which may then require further intervention.

136
D: Oral sirolimus. 

Explanation: The persistence and severity of the vascular lesion in this case, along with the history of non-responsiveness or low tolerance to other treatment methods including oral prednisolone, interventional radiology embolization and debulking, and pulsed dye laser therapy, suggests the need for a potentially more efficacious treatment option. Oral sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has been demonstrated to be effective in treating complicated vascular anomalies that are unresponsive to standard treatments. It is generally well tolerated and can result in significant reduction of the size and symptoms of the lesion, which could potentially prevent further visual impairment in this young boy. It is important to monitor the patient closely for potential side effects while on the medication.

A: Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma

Explanation: The symptoms and clinical findings of the patient, coupled with the biopsy results indicating a significant amount of large, pleomorphic mononuclear cells within the vessels with high proliferation index (Ki-67 labeling index was 70%), point toward the diagnosis of an Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of lymphoma is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma where the malignant cells proliferate within the lumina of small blood vessels, hence the term 'intravascular'. The immunohistochemical stain results showing positive CD3 but negative for CD20 further support the diagnosis as CD3 is a marker for T cells, whereas CD20 is a marker for B cells. Large B-cell lymphoma would typically show CD20 positive, and metastatic carcinoma or natural killer/T-cell lymphoma would likely present with more systemic symptoms or evidence of primary neoplasm elsewhere. As the symptoms and findings are localized to the face and scalp of the patient without any systemic involvement, it makes Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma the most plausible diagnosis.

138
C: Lepromatous leprosy

Explanation: The presenting symptoms of severe nasal congestion, saddle-nose deformity, and cutaneous lesions suggest lepromatous leprosy. The presence of poorly formed granulomas and pink bacilli in the cutaneous lesion, as identified by Fite acid-fast stain, are indicative of Mycobacterium leprae, the causative organism of leprosy. Lepromatous leprosy type is characterized by numerous lesions and nodules, often resulting in severe disfigurement. In this case, the nasal deformity is likely due to the destruction of nasal cartilage by the bacilli. The other options are less likely given the combination of symptoms and biopsy result. Sarcoidosis usually presents with noncaseating granulomas, not poorly formed ones. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically involves the respiratory tract and kidneys, not so much the skin, and would not account for the positively stained bacilli. Progression of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is unlikely based on the positive acid-fast bacilli stain, a result not associated with such lymphomas.
C
139
B: Coccidioidomycosis

Explanation: Diagnosis for this case can be challenging because the patient's symptoms and travel history can suggest several possibilities. However, her history of travel to Southwestern US states, notably Texas and California, where Coccidioidomycosis is endemic, along with persistent symptoms despite antibiotic therapy, and histopathological findings of granulomatous inflammation, indicate a fungal infection. Furthermore, azoles, a class of drugs commonly used to treat Coccidioidomycosis, is noted for its ability to produce both pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and a granulomatous reaction, further supporting this diagnosis. Hence, based on the collected data, my answer is B: Coccidioidomycosis. This condition can be confirmed with further testing like fungal cultures, serology, or PCR. Other options could also be possible but are less likely based on the presented history and examination findings.
B
140
B: Blastomycosis 

Explanation: Progressive hoarseness and dyspnea with no improvement in symptoms after treatment for asthma along with the subsequent laryngoscopy findings might not be characteristic of Sarcoidosis, Squamous cell cancer, or Tuberculosis. Blastomycosis, a fungal infection, could cause such symptoms and signs. It is known to affect the skin, lungs, and occasionally other areas such as the vocal cords and can cause progressive laryngeal and respiratory tract symptoms. The patient's laryngeal edema and vocal cord immobility might be due to this fungal infection. The absence of weight loss, fever, or other systemic symptoms could make malignancy or tuberculosis less likely. Moreover, the patient's location or travel history, if they were in an area where Blastomycosis is endemic, might also support this diagnosis. Histology from the biopsy could be used for definitive diagnosis, looking for broad-based budding yeasts, characteristic of Blastomyces dermatitidis.
B
141
C: Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma)

Explanation: The clinical manifestations and histopathological findings in this case are consistent with Farber disease, also known as disseminated lipogranuloma. This rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease is characterized by the accumulation of ceramide in various tissues due to the lack of acid ceramidase. Presentation typically occurs within the first few weeks of life with the development of subcutaneous nodules, joint deformities, and a hoarse cry due to laryngeal involvement, all of which are present in this case. The histopathological findings indicating a granulomatous pattern, numerous foamy cells, marked collagen degeneration, and mucin deposition, as well as comma-shaped curvilinear tubular structures, lend further support to this diagnosis. Although the other choices could potentially present with skin nodules, they do not explain the other clinical and histopathological features seen in this case.

C: Keloidal scleroderma. 

Explanation: 
Keloidal scleroderma, a rare subtype of localised scleroderma, is characterised by the development of thick, pruritic, firm, red-brown plaques resembling keloids. It can occur in systemic scleroderma patients. It is usually located on the trunk and/or extremities. The other answer choices are less likely due to the associated history and the unremarkable complete blood count. Sarcoidosis usually presents with systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss and lymphadenopathy. Lobomycosis is a chronic skin infection caused by fungus, usually presenting with nodules and keloidal lesions typically on the extremities. Fibroblastic rheumatism typically causes joint inflammation and skin nodules.

A: Giant cell arteritis 

Explanation: This elderly woman's clinical picture is typical of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA often initially presents with nonspecific symptoms such as a new headache, fever, and weight loss. On examination, her obvious ptosis and extraocular motility limitations suggest an ischemic etiology rather than a primary muscle disorder. The ocular complications of GCA occur from interruption of the short posterior ciliary arteries which supply the anterior segment, optic nerve, and extraocular muscles. Involvement of the extraocular muscles can result in diplopia, which is often one of the initial manifestations of GCA. In addition to these findings, other symptoms like jaw claudication and the absence of neurologic abnormalities except in the ocular domain further suggest GCA. One characteristic feature of GCA is the relief of symptoms with high-dose glucocorticoids. Abnormal laboratory findings typical for GCA include a markedly elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, which are both evident in this patient. Imaging may help further corroborate the clinical suspicions, but the diagnosis of GCA can be made on clinical grounds alone. A temporal artery biopsy is often performed to confirm the diagnosis, but this may not always be necessary if the clinical picture is highly characteristic of GCA and the patient responds well to treatment.

C: Perform an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests a disorder affecting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor complex, possibly Best disease. Whereas a younger patient might have a diagnostic EOG, its sensitivity diminishes with age, and molecular genetic testing is more definitive. Intravitreal anti-VEGF if there is some element of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) might help, but the refractory nature of this fluid to previous treatments suggests a different pathogenesis. Photodynamic therapy could also treat CNV, but there is no leakage to suggest this is present. There is no indication for serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test which are typically ordered to evaluate for systemic diseases such as multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia which may have ocular manifestations.

B: Genetic testing

Explanation: The clinical presentation of the young girl suggests a form of inherited retinal dystrophy. Symptoms such as nyctalopia (night blindness), progressive vision loss, and the observed findings in the fundus examination are typical characteristics of such conditions. Furthermore, the patient’s family history of vision loss supports the likelihood of a genetic cause. Genetic testing is crucial for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows for a definitive diagnosis. Secondly, it facilitates genetic counseling for the patient and her family, thereby helping them understand the risk of the condition affecting future generations. As such, a genetic test (option B) is the most appropriate next step in this case, over options A (Electroretinogram, which tests the function of the patient’s retina but wouldn’t confirm a diagnosis), C (Observation, which would not be proactive enough given the progressive nature of her vision loss), and D (Muscle biopsy, which would not be relevant for a suspected inherited retinal disorder).

A: Eosinophilic sialodochitis

Explanation: The presentation of recurrent facial swelling, particularly of the salivary glands, along with a notable eosinophilic infiltrate on histology is suggestive of Eosinophilic sialodochitis (ES). ES is a rare disorder that presents with recurrent and recalcitrant salivary gland swelling. It is often associated with allergic conditions and characterized by salivary duct eosinophilic infiltration without systemic eosinophilia. Despite the lack of systemic eosinophilia in this case, the eosinophilic infiltrate in the salivary gland and lack of response to other treatments (indicative of recurrent and recalcitrant swelling) strongly suggest ES.

147
B: Branchial cleft cyst

Explanation: The cystic nature of the mass, location in the neck, presence of squamous cells in the aspirate, and recurrence after aspiration are all typical features of a branchial cleft cyst. These are congenital lesions that are typically present at birth, or become noticeable in early childhood. They can sometimes become infected or enlarge suddenly. The location of this lesion in the upper neck near the angle of the jaw is a typical location for a second branchial cleft cyst, which is the most common type.
A
148
B: Acquired elastotic hemangioma 

Explanation: The presentation of a slow-growing, erythematous-violaceous plaque on an extremity of an older adult man, as well as the histopathological findings of vascular proliferation without atypia in the dermis, is most consistent with an acquired elastotic hemangioma. This type of lesion is known to be unresponsive to topical treatments, as was the case in this patient. Despite its intimidating name, it is a benign cutaneous vascular proliferation commonly found in elderly individuals, more often in males, and typically on areas of the body exposed to sunlight. Histologically, it is characterized by a proliferation of small, round, or irregular vascular spaces. These spaces are intertwined with solar elastotic material and are lined with a single layer of endothelial cells without atypia, which explains the findings in the histopathology examination.

Explanation: Given the patient’s syncope and family history of sudden cardiac death, ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring would be warranted to evaluate for potentially malignant arrhythmias. An electrophysiology study (Option B) or cardiac device (Option C) might be considered if there were a strong suspicion of a tachyarrhythmia, whereas catheter ablation (Option D) it would be a therapeutic also if a ventricular arrhythmia was discovered. However, the ECG, echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI had not revealed any structural abnormalities or arrhythmias. The ambulatory event monitor (Option A) would serve as a more conservative diagnostic approach to assess for any potential arrhythmias occurring over a prolonged period outside the hospital setting. Considering the lack of demonstrated arrhythmia or structural heart disease, this would be a reasonable next step.
A: Check blood lead concentration

Explanation: The presentation of chronic abdominal pain, anemia, and basophilic stippling on peripheral smear (small, bluish-purple punctate inclusions in erythrocytes), along with the bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin, also known as Burton line, strongly suggests lead poisoning. It is a systemic disorder that can cause diverse findings. Classic symptoms include abdominal pain, anemia, and neurologic abnormalities. Chronic exposure can result in subtle symptoms, such as memory loss and headache, while acute poisoning can cause encephalopathy. Anemia caused by lead poisoning is generally normocytic and normochromic owing to inhibition of enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway. Both red blood cell and neurologic abnormalities occur because lead has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups, which are abundant in red cells and the central nervous system. Blood testing for lead concentration is the initial step in diagnosis. Lead encephalopathy is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with chelating agents even before blood lead results return.

B: Serum vascular endothelial growth factor

Explanation: The patient's presentation and the significant findings of high serum protein and a monoclonal immunoglobulin suggests a possibility of hyper-viscosity syndrome, commonly associated with conditions such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma. This condition could lead to vision symptoms due to retinal vascular abnormalities. In this situation, a serum vascular endothelial growth factor examination could provide more diagnostic information. This factor is often elevated in conditions causing a hyper-viscous state. It would be more useful than the other options. A lumbar puncture has already provided normal pressure readings and repeating it might not contribute additional information. Acetazolamide is often used to treat symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, which is not seen in this case. Fluorescein angiography is typically indicated in conditions affecting retinal circulation and might not be the best initial choice here.

Explanation: Since the patient's presentation and imaging are not typical for thyroid eye disease, and the thyroid function tests are normal, starting intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative thyroid eye disease might not be the best next step. Coordinating with primary team for treatment with octreotide may be premature without further investigation for recurrence of NET. Therefore, obtaining PET-CT imaging to look for additional metastases seems to be logical next step, given the patient's abnormal findings and history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET). A biopsy of the EOMs could be beneficial, but due to the risks and potential complications associated with this invasive procedure, it would make sense to explore non-invasive imaging first.
C: Refer to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment

Explanation: The patient’s clinical findings and positive interferon-gamma release assay help confirm the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis. Ocular tuberculosis can present in various forms such as uveitis, chorioretinitis, optic neuritis, and endophthalmitis and may be a complication of systemic tuberculosis or due to direct eye infection. In some cases, ocular symptoms may precede the typical systemic symptoms of tuberculosis. Negative chest radiography does not rule out systemic tuberculosis infection, as early stages primarily affects the eyes. In this patient, ocular manifestations are likely from mycobacterial infection, hence the treatment should focus on systemic antituberculous therapy. Referral to the health department for initiating 4-drug antituberculous treatment is most appropriate. Steroid and other immunosuppressive treatment may worsen the infection and should only be administered when antituberculous treatment alone fails to improve the condition. A reassurance may delay treatment and potentially worsen the condition. Ordering MRI and performing lumbar puncture is not necessary because the clinical and laboratory findings suggest an ocular tuberculosis.

D: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms point towards a condition known as intracapsular block syndrome (IBS), as evidenced by the elevated IOP, vision loss, and the milky substance found in the retro lental space despite ongoing anti-glaucoma therapy and prior cataract surgery. IBS is often caused by residual viscoelastic or intravitreal proteins migrating into the capsular bag. The indicated treatment for such condition includes pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag to eliminate the source of the blockage. Intravitreal antibiotics would be used concurrently to prevent infection. Pilocarpine eye drops (option A) would not resolve the issue since they primarily function in reducing IOP but would not tackle the primary problem here. Similarly, scheduling for glaucoma surgery (option B) although would help lower IOP, does not address the issue at hand, since it doesn't resolve the IBS. The YAG capsulotomy (option C) can create an opening in the posterior capsule, permitting trapped material to escape, but may not suffice in this particular case due to the high volume of the milky substance and distension of the capsular bag. Therefore, vitrectomy seems to be the more appropriate intervention at this point.

Explanation: The sudden development of venous sheathing and outer retinal changes consistent with a paraneoplastic response to melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) in a patient with a known history of clear cell sarcoma, a malignant melanoma variant, raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic phenomenon related to the immunostimulation induced by the palliative immunotherapy. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has been associated with the unmasking or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases, including uveitis and MAR. Option A may be considered due to the potential steroid-sparing nature of immunotherapy, however this could exacerbate a uveitis syndrome. Option C as well could provide helpful information however it is unlikely to change acute management of the patient. Option D entails the risk of further visual loss if a treatable paraneoplastic syndrome is present.
B: Multicentric Castleman disease

Explanation: The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features observed in the patient are suggestive of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). Symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss, are common in patients with MCD. In addition, the patient's elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels are consistent with MCD, as these cytokines play a central role in the disease pathogenesis. Lastly, histological findings, including the presence of regressed lymphoid follicles with onion skinning of mantle zone lymphocytes, proliferation of slitlike blood vessels, and an increased number of plasma cells, are characteristic of the hyaline vascular variant of MCD, which is the most common type.

D: Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma

Explanation: Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare form of skin cancer that is usually diagnosed in children and adolescents. The histopathologic analysis shows characteristic features of rhabdomyosarcoma, such as small, round blue cells with conspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm and the tumor cells were positive for MyoD1, a myogenic differentiation marker. This, along with the physical presentation described, aligns with the features of primary cutaneous embryonal RMS. Additionally, the other possible diagnoses like superficial lymphatic malformation, primary superficial Ewing sarcoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma may have similar features, but they lack the specific histologic findings of RMS and the positive MyoD1.

The ulcers are often painful and chronic and seen in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract and skin. EBVMCU has Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the biopsy, as seen in this patient. EBVMCU can mimic other diseases like histoplasmosis, lymphoma, other viral infections, and they usually persist despite antifungal or antibacterial therapy, as in this case. Moreover, other mentioned conditions are less likely due to the results from the lab and physical examination.

C: Pituitary apoplexy

Explanation: Pituitary apoplexy involves a sudden increase in pituitary gland size due to infarction or hemorrhage into a pituitary adenoma. The patient's presentation, including new onset headache, facial numbness, and acute onset bilateral ophthalmoplegia after a surgical procedure, is strongly suggestive of pituitary apoplexy. Moreover, the radiological finding of a large sellar mass that had previously shown homogenous enhancement but is now losing enhancement is consistent with intratumoral hemorrhage, supporting the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy. This can lead to compression of the surrounding neurologic structures, including the cranial nerves, explaining the patient's ocular movement disorders and sensory loss.

Explanation: The patient’s history of IV drug use, chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and clinical presentation suggest acute hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, which occurs in patients who have HBV. Hepatitis delta can occur as a co-infection (infection with HBV and HDV at the same time) or a superinfection (infection with HDV in a patient with chronic HBV). Patients with superinfection (as this patient) typically have onset of symptoms of liver disease and can have rapid progression to severe chronic liver disease. Diagnosis is by testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies; if positive, testing for HDV RNA can confirm the diagnosis. Unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, HDV cannot exist in the absence of HBV because it requires an HBV protein to replicate.

Explanation: The clinical presentation and physical findings of the patient suggest a possible diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis, an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of cartilaginous and proteoglycan-rich structures. The patient presented with recurrent eye pain and redness, and swelling and redness of the ear, which are symptoms commonly seen in relapsing polychondritis. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a biopsy of the left ear to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's high Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and C-reactive protein levels also suggest some sort of inflammatory process, which suggests an autoimmune disorder like relapsing polychondritis. Chest radiography and Pulmonary Function Testing are not immediately necessary as the patient has not displayed any respiratory symptoms. Prednisone is usually prescribed to control the inflammation after diagnosis has been confirmed. Using ibuprofen would just treat the symptoms without addressing the cause of the inflammation. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate next step.
D

Explanation: In this case, the history (insidious onset, progression over months, and worsening with fatigue), physical examination (unilateral ptosis, decreased margin-to-reflex distance 1, deep superior sulcus, and resistance to retropulsion), and negative antiacetylcholine receptor antibody test results together suggest a mass effect rather than myogenic, neurogenic, or neuromuscular junction causes of ptosis. The most common causes of a mass effect leading to ptosis are an orbital mass, enlarged extraocular muscle, or levator aponeurosis dehiscence. Intraconal and extraconal orbital masses, such as tumors, cysts, and vascular lesions, most commonly present with unilateral proptosis, but early or small lesions may instead manifest with deep superior sulcus and resistance to retropulsion. Simple observation (option A), diagnostic testing target to other causes of ptosis (option B and C) or immediate repair surgery (option A) could delay appropriate treatment and lead to potential harm for this patient if a mass was present and went undetected. Therefore, the next step should be to obtain orbital imaging with contrast (option D) to evaluate structures within the orbit.
C: Order urgent computed tomography scan and computed tomography angiography of the brain. 

Explanation: The sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia could be indications of a lesion in the brain, particularly in the areas responsible for eye movement. Such a lesion could be due to various conditions, including stroke, aneurysm, tumor, or infection. Given the patient's age and symptoms, an urgent brain CT scan and CT angiography would be necessary for ruling out these potentially life-threatening conditions. Ordering thyroid tests or acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers, as suggested in options A and B, wouldn't be a high priority in this case. Lumbar puncture (option D) could be contemplated once any possible brain lesion has been ruled out, as it may cause brain herniation in patients with raised intracranial pressure due to such a lesion.

B: Order ultrasound biomicroscopy

Explanation: The superonasal pigmented scleral lesion and subluxed intraocular lens (IOL) in the right eye, along with the patient's progressive loss of vision, raises concerns of an underlying issue affecting the sclera or the ciliary sulcus where the IOL is situated. The ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) would provide a detailed view of the anterior segment of the eye, which includes the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and sclera. It would help determine the extent of the lesion, its relation to the sclera and anterior segment structures, and the cause of the IOL subluxation. This detailed imaging would help in planning the appropriate management, whether it is surgical intervention for the subluxed IOL, treatment for the lesion, or both. Biopsy of the ocular surface lesion may be considered based on the UBM findings.

B: Check serum vitamin A levels

Explanation: The boy's symptoms suggest vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to xerophthalmia, characterized by night blindness and dryness (xerosis), and can progress to keratomalacia, which explains the stromal thinning and corneal ulceration seen in this boy. The child's restrictive diet (consisting of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade) is particularly concerning for vitamin A deficiency, given the absence of dietary sources rich in vitamin A. Therefore, checking serum vitamin A levels would be the most appropriate next step in managing this boy's condition. While the other options such as allergy testing, obtaining corneal herpes simplex viral cultures, and performing therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye could potentially be part of the treatment for eye disorders, vitamin A deficiency seems to be the most likely underlying cause in this scenario and should be addressed first.

166
B: Pneumolabyrinth

Explanation: The presentation of sudden-onset vertigo in combination with right-sided aural fullness and subjective hearing loss could be indicative of Pneumolabyrinth, a rare condition resulting from air in the inner ear usually due to a perilymphatic fistula caused by trauma or surgery. Although symptoms such as the positive right-sided Dix-Hallpike test, rotary nystagmus and worsening of the patient's symptoms could indicate other conditions like the Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome and Labyrinthitis, the presence of conductive hearing loss, particularly at lower frequencies, on the audiogram is more suggestive of Pneumolabyrinth. Furthermore, the absence of any history of vertigo or otologic surgery makes Meniere's disease less likely. A CT scan of the temporal bone would further help confirm the diagnosis.
B
167
B

Explanation: The diagnosis is a parathyroid cyst. Parathyroid cysts are rare asymptomatic neck masses that predominantly occur in women and are often found incidentally on imaging. They can develop from ectopic parathyroid tissue or through cystic degeneration of adenomas. The patient demonstrated a well-circumscribed anechoic mass without any solid nodularity or septation consistent with a cyst on ultrasonography. Additionally, the mass was located within the thyroid lobe, a common location for parathyroid cysts. The absence of malignant disease in the pathological examination along with the positive stain for PTH in the lesion tissue further support the diagnosis of a parathyroid cyst. This patient’s PTH level also fell within the normal reference range which is typical for nonfunctional parathyroid cysts and distinguishes them from functional cysts or adenomas that oversecrete PTH. Other conditions such as benign thyroid nodules, reactive viral lymphadenopathy, or thyroglossal duct cysts would present differently on imaging or pathology.
C: Parotid gland hemorrhage. Explanation: Given the patient's history of anticoagulation with warfarin and high INR of 4.4, this would predispose her to bleeding and hematoma formation. Additionally, the sudden onset of the swelling and the lack of findings highly suggestive of neoplasia (such as a well-defined mass, irregular borders, or lymphadenopathy) on the CT scans also point towards a parotid gland hemorrhage. The absence of pain and erythema make infection less likely. The slight hematuria also likely represents bleeding from the same coagulopathy. Primary parotid gland cancer and lymphoma are less likely due to these findings and the clinical picture.
C
169
B: Lupus panniculitis

Explanation: Lupus panniculitis, also known as lupus profundus, is a rare form of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus which involves primarily the subcutaneous fat. Symptoms include deep, firm, skin-coloured or red nodules and plaques that are asymptomatic or may be tender. It could also present as a subcutaneous atrophy. Although other laboratory tests are normal or negative, like in this case, the presence of atrophy, erythema, and bilateral cervical lymph nodes make lupus panniculitis a potential diagnosis. However, definitive diagnosis would still require histopathologic examination, ideally showing lymphocytic inflammation in the deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat which the given information doesn't provide. It is vital to note that this is a presumptive diagnosis and the other options could also be considered based on a more detailed history, clinical examination and investigative evidence.

C: Metastatic carcinoma

Explanation: The woman's history of a growing abdomen mass along with her new symptoms of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, vaginal bleeding, and the presentation of painful erythematous plaques on her trunk suggest the diagnosis of a metastatic carcinoma. Her skin biopsy results indicating the presence of large atypical cells with lymphovascular invasion also support this diagnosis. The findings from the contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which reveal a large heterogeneous mass in the right rectus abdominis muscle and a cystic lesion in the left ovary, lead to the suspicion of an underlying malignancy that could be ovarian in origin and has metastasized to the skin. Therefore, diagnosis C is the most plausible.

B: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes

Explanation: The case described indicates symptoms typical of mitochondrial diseases such as hearing loss, cataracts, motor symptoms and cognitive decline, and brain changes including cerebral atrophy and hypometabolism in the left cerebral hemisphere. Despite the absence of lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes in the described case, the constellation of symptoms and the poorly-responsive parkinsonism suggest mitochondrial disease, specifically Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS). Progressive supranuclear palsy and autosomal recessive parkinsonism are less likely due to the absence of specific symptoms and signs (such as vertical gaze palsy for the former and early onset, often in the first decade of life, for the latter) and negative family history of movement or developmental disorders. Additionally, the normal laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing make a paraneoplastic syndrome unlikely.

B: Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics

Explanation: This patient's symptoms such as fatigue, fever, night sweats, weight loss, along with skin lesions, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are suggestive of a systemic condition and these findings in his hematologic parameters warrant further evaluation with a bone marrow biopsy. This can help identify potential hematologic abnormalities that could explain his systemic symptoms and laboratory findings, like leukemia or another hematopoietic neoplasm associated with marrow infiltration. Biopsies of the skin lesions have already been performed and no pathogens have been identified, which makes it less likely that starting IV antibiotics (option A) or performing incision and drainage (option C) would be beneficial. Although dapsone could theoretically help if this was a neutrophilic dermatosis (option D), the patient's systemic symptoms and hematologic abnormalities indicate that this is not a skin-limited process. Therefore, further investigation of the systemic disease (namely, marrow evaluation) is necessary.

173
C: Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest urticaria, characterized by pruritic wheals that typically last for less than 24 hours each with no skin changes. Urticaria can be provoked by physical stimuli, like pressure in this case, which is called inducible or physical urticaria. Her symptoms started within two weeks after receiving the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine, suggesting a possible association. Acute urticaria is typically treated first with a nonsedating H1 antihistamine at standard doses, which can be increased up to 4 times the standard dose if symptoms persist. If symptoms still persist beyond 2 to 4 weeks despite high-dose antihistamines, a referral to allergy/immunology is recommended for further diagnosis and treatment. Although this patient's symptoms could potentially be related to the COVID-19 vaccine, they should not contraindicate future vaccination as urticaria is generally manageable and not life-threatening. While serious allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines can occur, they are extremely rare. Therefore, option A may not be the best approach, while a prescription for oral prednisone (option D) may be considered in severe, refractory cases. Considering epinephrine autoinjector (option B) may be relevant if anaphylaxis is on table, but no signs of anaphylaxis are seen in this patient's case. That's why option C seems to be the most reasonable initial approach.

174
B: Greater auricular nerve neuroma

Explanation: The clinical picture indicates hypoesthesia on the ear lobule, which suggests involvement of the great auricular nerve. This nerve can be injured during parotid surgery and this may result in a neuroma, which is a benign nerve sheath tumor. Neuromas can be painful and can provoke symptoms by pressure on the adjacent structures. The normal MRI does not exclude this diagnosis as neuromas might not be visible in imaging tests. The other options are less likely: A reactive lymphoid hyperplasia usually does not present with pain, a recurrent parotid tumor or a metastatic tumor deposit would likely have appeared on the MRI.
B
175
D. The most appropriate course of action would be transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve. 

Explanation: The patient's present condition is likely a complication of her multiple previous ocular surgeries, with the large subconjunctival mass being symptomatic of increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Revision of the bleb with mass excision (Option A) would address the mass itself, but not the underlining issue of increased IOP. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass (Option B) and silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity (Option C) might provide temporary relief, but would likely not offer a long term solution as they would not address the root cause of the problem. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation involves delivering laser energy to the ciliary body to reduce the production of aqueous humor, therefore reducing the intraocular pressure while removing the mass and Ahmed valve would directly address the current problematic condition. This could provide more durable relief from her symptoms and might help prevent future complications. However, it will need to be balanced against the risk of potential complications.
C: Perform bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The patient's presentation of visual symptoms, anemia, leukopenia, and abnormalities in bone marrow on MRI give a suspicion of a bone marrow disorder which could be leading to increased intracranial pressure and papilledema. A bone marrow biopsy would confirm the suspected diagnosis. Repeating the lumbar punctures or ophthalmic exams would not be as beneficial without understanding the cause of the abnormalities. Moreover, the absence of thrombosis on the MRV makes idiopathic intracranial hypertension less likely. Thus, the patients signs and symptoms lead to a hypothesis of bone marrow pathology causing these manifestations, that needs to be confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy.

177
B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit 

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation, the patient may be suffering from ocular myasthenia gravis (MG), a neurological disorder that can cause fluctuating diplopia and ptosis that improves with cold (as seen with the ice test). Although serological testing (Option A) can be useful for diagnosing MG, it is not always conclusive and many patients with ocular MG are seronegative. Revision ptosis repair (Option C) is also not a suitable first course of action. Without clarifying the underlying cause of the problem, further surgery may not produce the desired result and could even become harmful. Lastly, because the diagnosis is yet unconfirmed, it would be premature to begin symptomatic management with cholinesterase inhibitor (Option D). Therefore, the next best step would be to carry out Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits (Option B) to rule out structural abnormality or tumors that may be causing the patient's symptoms, such as aneurysm, tumor or other neurological disorders. If MRI results are normal, subsequent serological testing for MG or neuromuscular junction disorder can be considered.

D: Rule out an occult systemic neoplasm.

Explanation: Given the patient's ocular symptoms, unilateral yellow discoloration, suspicion of an intraocular mass, and negative history for ocular trauma or systemic diseases that could result in ocular jaundice, it seems pertinent to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm. This option could identify the underlying source of the yellow discoloration and intraocular mass, if they are manifestations of systemic disease. Although the other choices could also be valid in certain situations, it's crucial to first exclude the possibility of an underlying malignancy, considering the mass identified could represent a metastatic site of an undiagnosed primary neoplasm. Hence, the systemic investigation is a critical step in patient management.

B: Radiation recall myelopathy: continue steroids, discontinue doxorubicin.

Explanation: Radiation recall is a phenomenon in which previously irradiated tissue undergoes inflammation in response to a trigger, often a systemic agent such as a drug. In this case, the woman's symptoms started after she received liposomal doxorubicin, which potentially acted as a trigger in the previously irradiated spinal cord, and hence the appearance of symptoms and the MRI findings could be due to radiation recall myelopathy. This diagnosis is further supported by the lack of malignant cells in the lumbar puncture, and the stability of her symptoms with the use of steroids. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be to continue steroid treatment to manage the inflammation, and discontinue doxorubicin, the likely trigger of the radiation recall.

B: Deep lobe parotid tumor 

Explanation: The symptom profile and MRI scan are indicative of a deep lobe parotid tumor. This type of tumor is rare but can present with paresthesia and pain as the tumor can involve the trigeminal nerve. Also, the gradual nature of symptom onset is typical for a slow-growing, benign parotid gland tumor. Lastly, the imaging finding of a cystic, non-enhancing mass on T1 and hyperintense on T2 is suggestive of a parotid tumor. Other options such as encephalocele, trigeminal schwannoma, or juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma are less likely given the patient's age, symptom distribution, and imaging findings.
A
181
B: Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including symmetrical white and transparent papules, excessive wrinkling, white keratosis on the dorsum of hands worsened by water immersion and summer heat, and improved in winter, suggest the diagnosis of Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma. This is further corroborated by the biopsy showing hyperkeratosis, dilation of eccrine ducts in the epidermis and dermis, and hyperplasia of the sweat gland. Also, its onset in adulthood and absence of family history distinguish it from similar conditions like hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma. It does not fit eczema because the symptoms were not improved with topical treatments typically effective for eczema, and it does not meet the conditions for progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma as the patient's presentation was not characterized by symmetrically distributed, well-demarcated red patches. Lastly, the patient's increased need for hand washing due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated his condition.

C: COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy). 

Explanation: Given the severe condition of the patient due to COVID-19, which can lead to clotting issues and vasculopathy, combined with the presentation of symptoms consistent with ischemic injury such as necrotic plaques on the ears, the most likely diagnosis is COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy). This vascular problem results from the increased coagulation activity and endothelial damage that is observed in severe cases of COVID-19. In this particular case, the absence of pressure or trauma to the ears points away from pressure necrosis. Levamisole-induced vasculitis is less likely as there's no known exposure to the agent. Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum usually presents with painful skin lesions and primarily affects individuals with immunodeficiency which does not align neatly with the patient's described symptoms and medical history.

183
C: Order testing for anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies

Explanation: Given the presence of systemic symptoms (eg, dyspnea on exertion), physical findings of finger ulcerations and crackles at the lung bases, and chronic hepatitis B, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The digital ulcerations, livedo racemosa, retiform purpura, and erythematous papules on the fingers support a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis, a chronic connective tissue disease characterized by small vessel vasculopathy, fibrosis, and resultant atrophy. Type 2 diabetes does not typically result in finger ulcerations and psoriasis would not explain the systemic symptoms such as dyspnea. Given the presumptive diagnosis of systemic sclerosis, testing for disease-specific autoantibodies (anti-scl-70 [also known as anti-topoisomerase] and anticentromere) should be performed, as these would not only support the diagnosis but also offer prognostic information. Anti-scl-70 is associated with diffuse cutaneous disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiac involvement, and a worse prognosis; anticentromere is typically seen in limited cutaneous disease and is associated with a higher risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

B: Further surgical debridement

Explanation:
The patient's worsening wound condition despite antibiotic treatment, coupled with her signs of systemic infection, suggests the presence of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI). NSTIs are a spectrum of conditions characterized by extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and fascia, often in the setting of rapidly progressive systemic toxicity. NSTIs are one of the surgical emergencies that all physicians should know how to recognize and treat. 

Prompt surgical debridement is crucial in NSTI and should not be delayed for results of blood or wound cultures. A delay in surgical intervention of even a few hours can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of a necrotic wound with a violaceous border and systemic toxicity in this patient indicates that additional surgical debridement (option B) is necessary. In this case, antibiotic coverage should be broad and should include MRSA and gram-negative bacilli, as NSTIs are most commonly polymicrobial. 

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (option C). Systemic glucocorticoids (option D) would be contraindicated for invasive infections because they can impair the immune response. Given the current negative workup for disseminated fungal disease, empiric treatment with intravenous amphotericin B (option A) is not indicated.

A: Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests systemic vasculitis given her joint pain, nasal deformity (which could represent granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA; formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis]), and laboratory results (ie, hematuria, red blood cell casts, and an active urine sediment). Checking ANCA titers is the best next step as GPA, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are associated with a positive ANCA. Further classification is based on the pattern of ANCA staining: GPA is often associated with a cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA/PR3-ANCA) and microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are often associated with a perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA/MPO-ANCA). For patients like this, performing a kidney biopsy in addition to checking ANCA titers may also be necessary to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment. Depending on the specific findings, management could involve glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide or rituximab.

B

Explanation: The most likely next step would be to change therapies for Crohn disease. The patient's symptoms seem to have appeared following a medication change, and upon treatment with prednisone, the symptoms resolved. However, the symptoms recurred upon reduction of prednisone, indicating a possible autoimmune inflammatory process related to uncontrolled Crohn disease. Indeed, Crohn disease can manifest extra-intestinally and cause orbital inflammation. Therefore, considering a change in Crohn's disease management could potentially address the orbital inflammation. Option B "Change therapies for Crohn disease" would also likely be chosen over Option A "Prescribe long-term prednisone therapy" since long-term use of prednisone can lead to numerous side effects including osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and increased risk of infection. While it is always important to rule out underlying malignancy or other systemic causes of the orbital inflammation (Options C and D), initial management should likely focus on optimizing control of the known inflammatory condition, in this case Crohn's disease.
C: Genetic testing 

Explanation: Genetic testing is likely appropriate in this case, given the patient's presentation of multifocal vitelliform lesions and her lack of family history for retinal diseases. This may help in identifying potential genetic causes such as Best disease, vitelliform macular dystrophy, or other similar conditions that might explain the appearance of spontaneous vitelliform lesions. Anti-VEGF treatment doesn't seem to be effective as stated in the patient's history. As the scan for malignancy turned out to be negative, further testing on chest, abdomen, and pelvis might not be necessary, and antiretinal antibody testing might not provide much information as well because antibodies are not typically found in retina disorders. Thus, genetic testing is the most promising option, which can reveal if the patient has a genetic disorder that's causing the lesions and help in better treatment planning.

D: Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye. 

Explanation: The patient's symptomatic angle closure and worsening of her condition despite having a patent laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) in her left eye indicates that a mechanism other than pupillary block is at play here. This could likely be a plateau iris syndrome, lens-induced angle closure or a combinations of both. A clear lens extraction in her symptomatic (left) eye can offer an effective treatment. The surgical removal of the crystalline lens allows for deepening of the anterior chamber and widening of the angle, thereby relieving the angle-closure. This procedure would also have potential benefits in improving overall visual acuity. Given the failed response to systemic corticosteroids and her progressive symptoms, a surgical treatment seems appropriate.

A: Perform a diagnostic vitrectomy in the right eye

Explanation: As per the presented case data, a diagnostic vitrectomy in the right eye might be the most helpful option to explore. The patient exhibits vitreous inflammation and a serous retinal detachment in both eyes. These symptoms can be connected to various diseases, including Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis. Although other symptoms like poliosis or skin changes would hint towards VKH, they're absent. The lymphadenopathy in the mediastinal area and scleral thickening revealed through the CT scan are nonspecific findings and can be seen in both sarcoidosis and intraocular lymphoma. Therefore, the diagnosis is unclear and requires further investigation, which a diagnostic vitrectomy could provide. This procedure would evaluate the vitreous of the eye and potentially reveal more about the nature of the patient's condition. It's important to gather as much information as possible before pursuing more risky or invasive procedures like systemic steroids or biopsies. Patients such advanced in age also tolerate these procedures less well.

D: Crohn disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms including oral ulcerations, facial swelling, and the biopsy showing noncaseating granulomatous inflammation are indicative of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. In this case, the patient is demonstrating symptoms of orofacial granulomatosis, a type of Crohn's disease affecting the oral and facial areas. Other options like Mumps or Alcoholic sialosis are less likely due to absence of parotid involvement and non-drinking status of the patient. Sjogren disease usually presents with sicca symptoms and is negative for granulomatous inflammation.
D
191
D: Esophageal cancer

Explanation: This case presents a situation that, while having no clear primary site of disease visible, there are important indirect signs suggesting the most probable cause. The presentation of left vocal cord palsy suggests impingement on the laryngeal nerve. The laryngeal nerve, which comes off the vagus, follows a course down into the thorax, hooks under the aorta and then returns to the larynx. Along this course, it is particularly exposed to potential impingement in the thoracic part of the esophagus. Given these specifics, in combination with an ill-defined soft tissue mass identified in the left supraclavicular, prevertebral, and paravertebral regions which partially encases the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries, the most likely cause is an esophageal cancer that has come into contact with or is compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

B: Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis

Explanation: Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis (MMDH), also known as spiny keratoderma, is characterized by multiple, small, asymptomatic, spiny projections on the skin. MMDH is a very rare condition, and the exact cause is unknown. The condition tends to gradually spread and can occur on any part of the body, but in this case, only the left side was affected, which is a unique feature. The patient's biopsy results also support this diagnosis. The conditions of lichen spinulosus, porokeratosis, and viral warts were less consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and histological findings. Hence, the most probable diagnosis is Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis.

A: Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus

Explanation: This patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory test results, and biopsy findings are characteristic of nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (NBLE). NBLE is a rare subset of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by asymptomatic small erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules. The patient's positive antinuclear, anti-Smith, SSA/Ro, SSB/La, and anti-U1RNP antibodies further suggest the diagnosis of NBLE. A skin biopsy with histological features like leukocytoclastic vasculitis or neutrophilic infiltration can confirm the diagnosis. However, the biopsy findings should not exhibit features of Sweet syndrome which usually includes dermal edema and a dense neutrophilic infiltrate, or of palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis, which typically demonstrates foci of degenerated collagen surrounded by histiocytes, giant cells, and neutrophils. In addition, hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis would typically include urticarial lesions along with arthritis, uveitis, and glomerulonephritis which are not present in this case. Thus, based on the findings mentioned, the teenaged boy is likely to have nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus.

C: Consult interventional cardiology to discuss transcatheter mitral valve repair. 

Explanation: The Clinical scenario suggested severe mitral regurgitation, which can cause symptoms and complications such as pulmonary edema as notably present in this patient. Mitral regurgitation can potentially reduce forward blood flow from the left ventricle, causing inadequate left heart unloading and triggering a low-flow alarm in the Impella device. Therefore, fixing the severe mitral regurgitation is crucial, which can be achieved by consulting interventional cardiology for the possibility of a transcatheter mitral valve repair. This will help both in managing the symptoms and improve the performance and efficacy of the pVAD.

B: Fluorescein angiography. 

Explanation: Fluorescein angiography is important in this scenario to determine the source of the fluid. Since there is no evidence of neovascularization and the other layers of the macula appear normal, it is less likely that the source of this macular fluid is from an exudative process, which could be ruled out with a fluorescein angiogram. This will help to identify if there is a leakage of dye that can be causing the fluid buildup. It could also help rule out choroidal neovascularization and assist in further differential diagnosis.

A: Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results

Explanation: Given the patient's risk factors such as multiple sexual partners and intravenous drug use, as well as his clinical symptoms of vision disturbances, it is crucial to rule out infectious causes including HIV and syphilis. Both these infections could potentially cause optic disc edema as they can infect and cause inflammation of the optic nerve. Intravenous methylprednisolone is used for optic neuritis which is not fitting the patient's condition as per current details. Intravitreal foscarnet is used for CMV retinitis which also doesn't fit the current condition. A CT scan of the brain could be indicated if there were symptoms of a central nervous system disorder which the patient does not display. Therefore, obtaining serology results for HIV and syphilis stands the most rational initial approach.

C: Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling

Explanation: In a case like this, with no found causative agent for the patient's condition and with previous sampling showing no growth, it would be beneficial to repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling. The patient's condition continued to worsen despite the treatments administered, and his symptoms are suggestive of an infection. By repeating the sampling, there is a chance of identifying a causative agent that may have been missed earlier or has now proliferated to detectable levels. This would allow for more targeted and possibly more effective treatment. Moreover, a repeat sampling could provide additional clues to non-infectious causes, such as immune-mediated inflammation. Options A, B, and D would be less appropriate without further information on the cause of the patient's condition.

B: Atypical mycobacterium infection

Explanation: This patient's history of a long-standing parotid mass, recurrent swelling with antibiotic usage, and the recent MRI findings are suggestive of a Mycobacterium infection. Pediatric nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections often present with head and neck lymphadenopathy and this clinical presentation is suggestive of an atypical Mycobacterium infection. This kind of infection can be associated with negative TB and normal immunological tests. Although other options like Branchial cleft cyst, Chronic sialadenitis with abscess, and Venolymphatic malformation might present with similar signs, the MRI findings and the patient's history make Atypical mycobacterium infection the most likely diagnosis. The other conditions would likely present differently on imaging or have a different clinical course.

C: Axillary web syndrome

Explanation: Axillary web syndrome (AWS) also known as cording, presents as thick subcutaneous cord-like structures that appear days to weeks after axillary procedures (like sentinel lymph node biopsy in this case), causing pain and limiting mobility. The histology findings in the case of dilated and thrombosed lymphatic vessels with recanalization are consistent with AWS as well. AWS is likely related to the surgical trauma to the lymphatics and veins. Thus, it commonly occurs after procedures such as breast cancer surgeries or, as in this case, melanoma surgeries involving lymph node dissections. The AWS can cause symptoms like pain and limited range of motion, as noted in this patient. This condition often resolves spontaneously over months, but physical therapies can also help manage symptoms. The presence of this condition does not suggest metastatic spread of the melanoma.

B: Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation

Explanation: The patient history indicates recurrent atrial arrhythmias resistant to medication, and he has had cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for tachycardia. In such cases, catheter ablation may be considered as it can help to eliminate the problematic heart tissue causing the arrhythmias. An electrophysiology (EP) study allows the healthcare provider to see the precise nature of the arrhythmia problem and thereby plan subsequent treatments, making option B the most appropriate next step. While ambulatory ECG monitoring (A) could provide more data on heart rhythm, it may not significantly change management at this point. An emergency coronary angiogram (C) is not warranted based on the information provided. Exercise treadmill test (D) may be unnecessarily risky and potentially uninformative in this patient with known heart rhythm issues.

A: Brain/orbital imaging 

Explanation: Given the child’s lasting appearance of trauma, including the temple mass and bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema despite no recent head injury, the possibility of an underlying process should be explored. While reassuring that the boy's vision doesn't seem to be impaired and he is in no apparent distress, these symptoms aren't typical for common orbit complaints such as chalazion or stye. A more serious condition could potentially be present, such as a tumor or hematological anomaly, and imaging will allow for further investigation. While contacting Child Protective Services can also be a relevant concern, there is no mention of other indicators of child abuse in the case shared. Also, treatment with cool compresses and artificial tears may help with symptoms but it does not address the root cause. Lastly, a serologic workup for a bleeding diathesis could be considered, but imaging seems most immediate in this case.

D: Perform a comprehensive systemic workup

Explanation: The surprising aspect in this case is the rapid development of gingivitis not responding to antibiotics, along with an increase in white blood cell count, suggesting an underlying systemic disease. This situation alongside the atypical presentation of the choroidal mass, with features not commonly seen in typical choroidal melanoma or hemangioma, warrant a comprehensive systemic workup. Plaque radiotherapy, oral corticosteroids or enucleation may eventually be needed, but not without an improved understanding of the patient's systemic health status and a precise diagnosis. Given the negative infectious disease markers and unresponsiveness to antibiotics, it is necessary to rule out systemic neoplasia which, could be causing a metastatic choroidal mass along with gingival manifestation.

D: Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA.

Explanation: The patient presentation includes multiple system involvement; sensorineural hearing loss, impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, neurologic abnormalities (like cognitive impairment, poor coordination, muscle weakness), and myocardial hypertrophy. These are often seen in mitochondrial disorders, most of which are caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Thus, sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (option D) should be prioritized. It's also worth noting the elevated levels of lactic acid and pyruvic acid, known indicators of a possible mitochondrial disorder. While the other genetic tests may be valuable for specific conditions, the overall clinical picture in this case strongly suggests a mitochondrial disorder, necessitating mitochondrial DNA sequencing.

B: Atypical vasculitis

Explanation: The image findings and the clinical condition of the patient, including jaw pain, trismus, facial swelling along with evidence of multi-nuclear giant cells and inflammation over the biopsy, suggest a vasculitic process. The negative test for IgG4 and normal ESR rule out IgG4-related diseases and other conditions related to high ESR levels. Also, the lack of bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli elements over the Gram stain together with the unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy makes infections, like Actinomycosis, less likely. Given that common autoimmune causes have been ruled out, an atypical form of vasculitis might be causing these symptoms in this patient. This is further supported by progressive inflammation and involvement of the temporal lobe dura. However, a definitive diagnosis can only be established after a thorough work-up including rheumatology consultation and vasculitis panel, with potential for additional biopsy.
B
205
B: Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction. 

Explanation: Based on the patient's history of recent international travel to Costa Rica and undergoing systemic illness, along with his psoriatic arthritis medication stopped, there's a possibility of a systemic or infectious trigger causing his ophthalmic symptoms. His symptoms and the retinal detachment could be owing to an underlying infectious disease obtained during his travels or drug discontinuation induced inflammation. Thus, obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and PCR (option B) would be the best next step to identify any possible infectious agent. While surgical intervention (option C) might be needed in the future, identifying and treating the underlying cause is the immediate need. Both option A and D are treatments that might not be effective if an actual infectious agent is responsible. So, before proceeding with these therapies, it would be essential to rule out infectious causes which could worsen if proper antibacterial or antiviral treatments aren't given.

D: Obtain thoracic lymph node biopsy. 

Explanation: The girl's symptoms suggest a systemic inflammatory or infectious process. The panuveitis, myeloradiculopathy, enlarged spleen and lymph nodes indicate a possible systemic condition that should be investigated further. While her TB test was positive a year ago, her symptoms improved after RIPE therapy. Therefore, reinitiating RIPE therapy (option C) may not be necessary at this point. Lacrimal gland biopsy (option B) might be useful, but given the mild prominence on MRI, it seems less likely to provide definitive information. Considering plasmapheresis (option A) may bear risk and doesn't directly address the potential underlying cause. Instead, The thoracic lymph node biopsy will provide the most useful information regarding the nature and status of the disease process. It can confirm or exclude malignancy, granulomatous diseases, or an infectious process.

B: Pinpoint papular light eruption

Explanation: The clinical history of recurrent pustular eruptions triggered by sunlight exposure and onset within hours of sun exposure in a patient without systemic symptoms makes non-bullous pinpoint papular light eruption (PPLE) a likely diagnosis. PPLE is a rare type of polymorphous light eruption (PMLE), the most common photosensitivity disorder, that has characteristic monomorphous tiny erythematous edematous papules or pustules. Treatment includes sun avoidance, sun protective clothing, broad-spectrum sunscreen, and prophylactic phototherapy. Other options all have distinctive features so they are less likely. Papulopustular rosacea presents with central facial erythema, telangiectasia, and is not typically photosensitive. Actinic folliculitis is characterized by pruritic papules and pustules after sun exposure but is almost exclusively found in males with oily skin. Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis is usually drug induced with a slower onset and large "half-dollar" size plaques.

D: Trichofolliculoma

Explanation: The presence of multiple hair follicles within a fibrotic stroma, as the histologic finding in individual lesions, and growth of nodules in parallel with the body growth are indicative of organoid nevus, particularly trichofolliculoma. In this case, the absence of sebaceous glands excludes the possibility of a diagnosis of sebaceous nevus, while the formation of the hair follicle rules out connective tissue nevus. The hair follicle nevus is usually solitary and rarely transforms into multiple or giant lesions. Thus, a diagnosis of trichofolliculoma would be appropriate in describing the lesions in this patient case.

C: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. 

Explanation: The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is a measure of how much oxygen passes from the air sacs of the lungs into the blood. The reduced Dlco value, despite normal chest imaging and pulmonary function tests, suggests a potential problem with oxygen transfer from the lungs to the bloodstream, which could indicate an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. Hemoglobin levels are within normal range, and the normal forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume make other potential explanations less likely.

210
B: Neuroschistosomiasis

Explanation: The patient's recent travel history to northeastern Brazil and her symptoms align with neuroschistosomiasis. This neurological disorder is caused by the infestation of Schistosoma, a parasitic flatworm, in the central nervous system. The condition is associated with eosinophilia, or a high level of eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell. In this case, the patient's blood tests showed that 16.4% of her total leukocytes were eosinophils. Additionally, the CSF analysis showed high levels of eosinophils, suggestive of a parasitic infection. The patchy pulmonary infiltrates could be a manifestation of the parasite eggs or larvae travel via the bloodstream. 

Thus, the history, symptoms, and blood and CSF tests point towards Neuroschistosomiasis. However, to confirm the diagnosis, serological testing for Schistosoma antibodies or a biopsy showing Schistosoma eggs may be required. Given the rarity and potential severity of this condition, immediate treatment usually involves a combination of praziquantel and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and kill the parasites.

Answer: C

Explanation: Given the unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding, evidence of inflammation and apoptosis on intestinal pathology, and the findings on the ophthalmologic examination in a profoundly immunosuppressed patient, the most concerning diagnosis is cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.Gastrointestinal CMV disease in patients with HIV can cause ulceration and bleeding and is often associated with systemic symptoms such as weight loss and fever which he exhibited earlier; visualization of viral inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, or an "owl's eye" appearance is classic. The retinal changes also suggest CMV retinitis, which can cause blurred vision and floaters, eventually progressing to loss of peripheral vision and in severe cases, retinal detachment and blindness. In this patient, the initial therapy should be with intravenous ganciclovir (option C).
A: Perform repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination. 

Explanation: Axillary lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes, is a common immune response and can occur after receiving vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. Since the patient recently received a COVID-19 vaccination in the right arm, the enlarged lymph nodes could be a result of this immune response rather than an indicator of further metastasis from the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). It is recommended to perform a repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination in order to evaluate the change in condition of the lymph nodes. If the lymphadenopathy persists at this time, further evaluation may be necessary to rule out metastatic disease.

D: Stop voriconazole. 

Explanation: The patient has multiple joint involvement with an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, suggesting possible bone involvement. However, the timing of her symptoms after her transplant, the dramatic presentation, and the presence of fungal infection suggest an adverse drug reaction. Among her current medications, voriconazole is known to cause periostitis, a condition that can manifest as severe polyarthralgia. Severe voriconazole-induced periostitis has been reported in solid organ transplant recipients and is characterized by elevated alkaline phosphatase and fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography scanning. Stopping voriconazole would therefore be the most appropriate next step in her management.

214
C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. 

Explanation: Given the findings of peripapillary hemorrhages and optic disc swelling in a patient with CML and new neurologic symptoms such as headache, the leading diagnosis is leukemic infiltration of the optic nerve, also known as leukemic optic neuropathy. This is a neuro-ophthalmic emergency as it can rapidly progress to severe vision loss. Increased leukemic cell counts can infiltrate the optic nerve and cause hemorrhage and swelling. Therefore, immediate brain and orbit magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be conducted. Intravitreal injections are not first-line treatments for this condition as they would not address the underlying issue of leukemic infiltration. The consultation of radiation oncology could be considered after imaging results for possible radiotherapy, but it's not the immediate step. Observation and reassurance would simply delay necessary treatment.

215
B: Measure blood glucose levels

Explanation: Homonymous hemianopia is classically associated with lesions of the occipital lobe or the optic tract. However, in this case the patient also exhibits polydipsia and lethargy which point to hyperglycemia. Given that the noncontrast CT and initial MRI did not provide definitive results, the most likely explanation may be an atypical presentation of hyperglycemia. Thus checking blood glucose levels could be the next best step for this patient as it can quickly rule out a potentially reversible cause.  Further, his medication rosuvastatin is used for high cholesterol which also suggests a possible history of uncontrolled diabetes, a risk factor for hyperglycemia. It must be noted though that homonymous hemianopia due to hyperglycemia is relatively rare, but not impossible. Therefore, it is crucial to check the blood glucose levels considering the new symptoms and medical history of the patient. If blood glucose levels were normal, then exploring other options such as a lumbar puncture or further neuroimaging would be warranted.

B

Explanation: Considering the clinical characteristics of the mass, which include gradual growth, tenderness, firmness, mobility, and noncompressibility without overlying erythema or ulceration, the most reasonable next step would be an excisional biopsy to rule out malignancy. The absence of preceding trauma, infection, or inflammation, in addition to its firm and noncompressible nature, makes a benign etiology such as a cyst, trauma, or inflammation less likely. Therefore, while the possibilities include a benign lesion or inflammation, malignancy such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or sebaceous gland carcinoma needs to be excluded promptly due to their potential for local destruction and spread. Hence, observation or conservative management with warm compresses and massage would not adequately address the potential risk associated with these lesions. The excisional biopsy, on the other hand, would provide both diagnostic and possible therapeutic outcomes.
A: Transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve for grading and immunohistochemistry

Explanation: Considering the results of the second MRI and the significant vision loss, the priority is to confirmively diagnose the nature of this lesion in order to guide further treatment. A biopsy of the right optic nerve would allow for immunohistochemical studies that could definitively identify whether this is indeed an optic nerve glioma or another type of neoplasm, and it would also provide the grading necessary to determine the most effective treatment plan.

B: Linear discoid lupus erythematosus

Explanation: The physical examination description, biopsy findings, dermatoscopic examination, the patient's historical events, and his symptoms match the profile of Linear discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). In this patient, progressive scalp hair loss and the arc-shaped, depressed groove on the forehead are the result of chronic skin inflammation associated with discoid lupus. DLE is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus presents as erythematous, disk-shaped plaques with adherent scale that can lead to scarring. Linear DLE, a variant, can present as linear, erythematous, thickened, scaly plaques along Blaschko's lines. The histopathology findings in this case of lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and subcutaneous fat necrosis are characteristic of DLE. Also, the patient's response to intralesional steroid treatment suggests an inflammatory process, as is found in DLE. The other options such as linear atrophoderma of Moulin, lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp, and localized lipodystrophy are less likely due to the combination of clinical and histopathological findings.

C: Good syndrome

Explanation: Good syndrome is a rare condition typified by thymoma, hypogammaglobulinemia, and increased susceptibility to infections. It commonly presents with recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections, as well as oral lesions, as this patient exhibited. Additionally, hypogammaglobulinemia, which is specifically characterized by low IgG levels, as seen in this patient, is a key characteristic of Good syndrome. The finding of a thymoma further strengthens the diagnosis. Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome and Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity are less likely, given the absence of autoantibodies in this patient's serologic evaluation. Paraneoplastic lichen planus is also unlikely considering the absence of lichenoid lesions in other mucocutaneous sites.

C: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation: Given the presentation history and ECG findings, it seems that the issue is likely to be structural rather than ischemic. Therefore, the first step could be to perform a Cardiac MRI to better evaluate the anatomy of the heart, the presence of fibrosis, and any potential structural anomalies that could be causing the patient's symptoms. Coronary angiogram and dobutamine stress echocardiogram, while useful, are more directed towards ischemia or infarct which is less likely given the patient's age and history. CT angiography of the chest may not provide enough detailed information regarding the heart structure compared to a cardiac MRI.

A: Malignant atrophic papulosis

Explanation: This patient's cutaneous lesions, acute myelopathy, and other signs are suggestive of a rare vasculopathy known as Degos disease or malignant atrophic papulosis. The skin lesions in this condition typically present as small (2-15mm) papules with a porcelain-white center and surrounding erythematous rim. These lesions can appear anywhere on the body but typically spare the face. The disease can also present with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations, acute myelopathy being one of them. The condition is diagnosed by skin biopsy, which shows wedge-shaped areas of necrosis in the dermis. All other answer choices are less likely given the combination of neurologic and skin findings in this patient.

A

Explanation: This patient has a multisystem inflammatory disorder suggestive of vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. She presents with constitutional symptoms (arthralgias), cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (purpuric rash and hemorrhagic vesicles), eye involvement (possibly scleritis, given the redness and pain), and negative testing for immune complex disease by direct immunofluorescence testing, all of which suggest ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). AAV, which includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome), and microscopic polyangiitis, often presents with nonspecific systemic symptoms such as malaise, weight loss, and arthralgias. GPA can also cause inflammation of the upper airways (eg, sinusitis, epistaxis), lower airways (eg, cough, hemoptysis), or kidneys (eg, hematuria). Due to the severity of these diseases, checking ANCA titers (Choice A) would be the best next step.
C: Recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test. 

Explanation: The patient’s pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates could be caused by infectious mononucleosis, which can lead to multiple symptoms including fever, lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar exudates. The heterophile antibody test, also known as the monospot test, is used to detect infectious mononucleosis. However, this test can often be negative during the first week of illness. In light of the negative rapid strep tests and throat culture, as well as the lack of response to amoxicillin, it would be logical to recheck the heterophile antibody test given that the current presentation is one week after the initial test, as mononucleosis could be a chief possible consideration now. The other options are less likely as mononucleosis matches her symptoms more closely.

B: Order urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test. 

Explanation: The key clinical findings are Anterior Uveitis and unilaterally predominant optic disc swelling in a young boy, together with hints of renal dysfunction suggested by elevated serum creatinine level. Considering these factors, Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a possible differential diagnosis. This syndrome can present as anterior uveitis and renal dysfunction, which matches the boy's presentation. Before administering steroids, which could potentially obscure a diagnostic finding in urinalysis, it is crucial to conduct a urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test to check for signs of tubulointerstitial nephritis, which is a typical feature of TINU syndrome. This could provide a more accurate diagnosis and guide more targeted and effective treatment.

225
C: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diplopia, ptosis, and drooling suggest a neurological disorder. The diplopia (double vision) suggests a problem with the patient's cranial nerves, in this case, particularly the third cranial nerve which innervates the muscles controlling eye movement and the eyelid. The drooling can result from dysfunction of either the facial (seventh) nerve, hypoglossal (twelfth) nerve, or the motor component of the trigeminal (fifth) nerve. Therefore, a problem in the brainstem where these nerves originate could be probable. The cranial nerve examination provided further evidence, demonstrating abnormalities in cranial nerves V (trigeminal) and III (oculomotor). A brain MRI with contrast can help visualize the brainstem and cranial nerves, making it the most appropriate next step. An MRI is preferred over a CT due to its greater sensitivity in detecting soft tissue abnormalities. Further, a contrast agent can help highlight any pathological areas. Performing a lumbar puncture or testing inflammatory markers would likely be premature at this stage as these would be more helpful if there were signs or suspicion of infection or inflammation, which isn't evident from the information provided. Lastly, CT angiography of the head and neck might be considered in a case of acute neurological deficits that raise suspicion of vascular causes such as stroke, but in this case, the woman's symptoms suggest a more chronic condition, diminishing the likelihood of a stroke that typically presents abruptly. Considering all these factors, obtaining an MRI of the brain with contrast appears to be the most appropriate next step in workup.

C: Laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease. 

Explanation: This patient’s symptoms of bilateral diffuse nonblanching scleral redness, ocular tenderness, and history of high-risk sexual behavior point to a diagnosis of diffuse scleritis, often associated with an underlying systemic condition such as infection (bacterial, viral, etc.) or autoimmune disease. It is crucial to validate the cause before initiating treatment. Hence, laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease (Option C) should be the next step. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids (both oral and topical) are often used to reduce the inflammation and pain once the underlying cause has been established and so options A, B, and D would be premature at this stage.

227
A: YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall 

Explanation: The severe rise in intraocular pressure along with the decreased visual acuity in the left eye and the remarkable findings in the anterior segment signify an acute problem. There is a need to decrease the pressure and to verify whether the cause of the pressure increase is due to the enlargement of the cystic iris stromal lesion. YAG laser treatment can help in perforating the cystic wall enabling the fluid within to drain, reducing the intraocular pressure. Observation will not be an ideal option due to the acuteness of the symptoms and the potential risk of permanent damage. A biopsy could potentially provide useful diagnostic information but it does not address the immediate concern of high pressure. Glaucoma tube surgery might not be immediately necessary and is typically considered when medicinal treatment isn't enough, but in this case, the high IOP seems to be directly related to the cystic lesion.

228
C: Review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids 

Explanation: Considering the patient's medical history and her recent treatments, the bilateral hypopyon in this case indicates a systemic underlying cause rather than an issue isolated to the eyes. There's no evidence of bacterial infection in the case. Therefore, option A and B may not be the primary responses. As the hypopyon recurred in the other eye, it could be a response to the systemic medications utilized for the treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection. Thus, a review and potential adjustment of the systemic medications (Option C) is the rational approach, complemented by a topical corticosteroid therapy to manage ocular inflammation. Option D may be an overreach, as systemic corticosteroid isn't explicitly required based on presented symptoms and signs. Instead, a focal therapy for the ocular inflammation after adjusting systemic regimen seems more appropriate at this stage.

B: Calciphylaxis 

Explanation: Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and serious condition characterized by the calcification of blood vessels, leading to skin necrosis and pain. The patient in the case has elevated phosphorus and prolonged prothrombin time, which are both observed in patients with calciphylaxis. Painful skin eruptions, retiform purpura, and skin necrosis, observed in the patient, are also clinical manifestations of calciphylaxis. Furthermore, the biopsy results revealed calcium deposits and pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like changes, both of which are characteristic of this disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Calciphylaxis. It is important to note that while calciphylaxis is commonly associated with chronic kidney disease, it can also appear as a result of certain medications, as possibly indicated by the patient's use of pemigatinib.

B: Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome

Explanation: Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome, also known as acroangiodermatitis, is a type of pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma. The clinical features - painless, progressive, purple plaques which are resistant to treatment, superficial and deep vascular proliferation with endothelial thickening, and a hypervascular soft tissue mass on imaging - all align with this condition. Disease onset is more common in young males, as per the patient in the given case. Despite the similar appearance, Kaposi sarcoma is unlikely as it's more common in immunocompromised individuals and this patient has no such history. Moreover, the patient's lesions, although they resemble lichen planus in some aspects, have been present for years and are enlarging and darkening, which is not typical of lichen planus. Finally, Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is a condition similar to Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome, but it typically appears on the extremities under high venous pressure, whereas in this case the lesions appear without this predisposing factor.

B: Cutaneous aspergillosis 

Explanation: The presence of septate hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous aspergillosis. Aspergillus species are common in the environment, and the patient's symptoms, especially respiratory issues exacerbated by exposure to dust, indicate a likely exposure to the fungus. Additionally, the occupation of the patient as a painter might expose him to spores more frequently. Furthermore, Aspergillus species have been known to form granulomas, presenting as nodules like in the case of this patient. Other options like nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, phaeohyphomycosis, and entomophthoromycosis could have similar presentations but the histopathological findings of septate hyphae with acute-angled branching are more consistent with aspergillosis.

A: Perform a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass

Explanation: In this case scenario, the first step would be to identify the nature of these systemic lesions observed in different locations. While all options are plausible, it would be best to first conduct a biopsy which is less invasive than surgical resection. A thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass will clarify whether this is a local recurrence of the Burkitt lymphoma, a new primary malignancy or a metastasis from another primary malignancy. Upon confirming the diagnosis, a more targeted treatment plan can then be developed, which could include surgical resection or chemotherapy. Moreover, it is crucial to rule out the possibility of the mass being benign, in which case, urgent surgical resection might be unnecessary.

A. Given the patient's history of travel to India, significant elevation in inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), radiographic findings of lung and spine infection, and unresponsiveness to empirical azithromycin, there is high suspicion for tuberculosis. His lack of response to azithromycin also rules out less likely but common causes like community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The options of measuring prostate-specific antigen, or starting cefepime, vancomycin, doxycycline, rifampin and streptomycin are not as relevant as the patient does not present with symptoms indicative of prostate infection or antibiotics specifically covering typical bacterial causes of pneumonia and spinal infections. Therefore, placing the patient in airborne isolation and starting him on antitubercular therapy with ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin is the most appropriate course of action. This would both protect other hospital patients and personnel from potential infection and treat the suspected tuberculosis infection.
Without the tables for Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) results, I cannot interpret the results and choose an answer. 

However, based on the clinical features presented like progressive lower extremity pain, gait imbalance, reduced pinprick sensation in feet, absent vibratory sensation at toes, weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, absent ankle jerk reflexes, high-arched feet, and hammer toes, it is likely indicative of a form of peripheral neuropathy.

Axonal polyneuropathy may cause these symptoms. This condition involves damage to the axon part of the peripheral nerve, and it's often associated with systemic conditions like diabetes, though other causes exist.

Demyelinating polyneuropathy could also potentially cause these symptoms. This involves damage to the myelin sheath protecting the peripheral nerves.

Polyradiculopathy refers to a condition where the nerve roots are damaged, which could also potentially explain these symptoms.

To conclusively decide, the data from the Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) is required. These tests can give further insight into whether the problem lies with the axons, the myelin sheath, or the nerve roots.
B: Discontinue minocycline

Explanation: 
This patient's blue-black skin pigmentation, along with discoloration of the sclera and teeth, is consistent with minocycline-induced pigmentation. Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, can cause pigmentation of various body tissues, including the skin, nails, thyroid, mouth, bone, sclera and heart. The pigmentation can be blue, brown or black and usually begins after several months of therapy. Risk factors include higher cumulative dose, longer duration of treatment, and renal insufficiency. The pigmentation is often irreversible, but slow fading may be noted after discontinuation of the medication. Therefore, the best next step would be to discontinue the use of minocycline (Choice B). The other options, including discontinuing apixaban (Choice A), ordering serum iron studies (Choice C), or ordering serum niacin levels (Choice D), would not directly address the issue of minocycline-induced pigmentation.

Answer: D

Explanation: The use of in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) can be helpful in identifying microbial pathogens directly in corneal tissue, often in real time, which can guide therapy in the absence of positive culture data. The patient’s recent history of freshwater exposure and the contact lens use raised suspicion for Acanthamoeba keratitis, a rare but severe ocular infection. IVCM images of the cornea demonstrated multiple double-walled cysts consistent with the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The presence of double-walled cysts has been reported to be a fairly specific IVCM finding in Acanthamoeba keratitis. Thus, empirical treatment with anti-acanthamoebal therapy, such as polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate (option D), would be indicated while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures.
C: Observation

Explanation: In this case, the 70-year-old woman is experiencing new-onset macular schisis including foveal involvement in the context of primary open-angle glaucoma. However, her intraocular pressures are well-controlled, and her pupillary reflexes are normal. Attempts to surgically or otherwise physically address the schisis could potentially cause further complications, and there is not enough information to suggest that this schisis is due to any kind of genetic condition that would be elucidated by the RS1 gene testing. Therefore, it seems most prudent to initially choose careful observation of this patient's condition. The patient should be educated about the importance of regular follow-up visits and close monitoring of symptoms. If the condition worsens or does not improve, further treatment options can be considered.

C: Genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease.

Explanation: The presentation of bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and headache in this patient suggests a possible systemic mitochondrial disease. The macular atrophy is a possible sign of a retinal disease called Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS). This condition often presents with symptoms such as hearing loss, headaches, and vision loss due to macular atrophy. As no family history of visual or auditory disorders is present, the likelihood of conditions like pattern dystrophy or Stargardt disease, which are usually inherited, is low. Consequently, while tests to investigate intraocular inflammation may be valuable, genetic testing for a mitochondrial disease would be the most logical next step in this context. The presence of a systemic disease would be better matched with this selection, given the patient's symptoms in different organ systems.

B: Perform a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan

Explanation: Given the findings of bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye, and despite normal results from hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup tests, it would be prudent to further investigate for any underlying conditions that have not yet been identified. The selected option proposes to perform a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan, which can help to detect any possible abnormalities or pathologies present in the thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic regions. Such potential findings could provide key insights into what might be contributing to this patient's bilateral nonischemic CRVO. This option is chosen over others because it does not propose an immediate invasive treatment or dismisses the need for further investigation, both of which could potentially be detrimental given the current incomplete understanding of the patient's condition.

C: Angiosarcoma 

Explanation: Given the patient’s history of radiation treatment for retinoblastoma and the presentation of a vascular mass, the diagnosis is likely Angiosarcoma. This is a rare type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood vessels and lymph vessels. The patient's history of radiation therapy at a young age increases her risk for this type of malignancy. The mass in the common iliac vein indicates a vascular origin, as Leiomyosarcoma and Liposarcoma are typically of a muscular or adipose origin respectively. Hemangioendothelioma, while vascular in nature, is typically seen more commonly in the liver or lung, rather than the extremities. Further diagnostic clarification with biopsy and imaging would confirm the diagnosis definitively.

C: Parathyroid cyst

Explanation: A parathyroid cyst is the likely diagnosis for this patient. Parathyroid cysts are rare, benign lesions accounting for less than 1% of all parathyroid masses. They are often misdiagnosed due to their rarity and nonspecific clinical and imaging characteristics. In this case, the cyst was located on the right side of the patient's neck abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe, which is a typical location for a parathyroid cyst. Furthermore, the cystic fluid was positive for PTH (Parathyroid Hormone) which is highly suggestive of a parathyroid cyst. Finally, the patient exhibited symptoms of dyspnea and pressure in the neck, which can be associated with larger parathyroid cysts causing compression of surrounding structures. Her laboratory tests were normal, indicating that the cyst was non-functional and not producing excessive parathyroid hormone.

242
C: Growing teratoma syndrome

Explanation: Growing teratoma syndrome refers to an increase in tumor size despite normalization of tumor markers after successful treatment of nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). While initial treatment reduced metastatic tumor burden and normalised tumor markers, the enlargement of the neck mass after treatment is indicative of this syndrome. A diagnosis of latent metastasis would not be consistent with the normalization of his tumor markers. Similarly, a supraclavicular lymphocele would not account for both the size and characteristics of the mass, and a benign teratoma would not typically enlarge after chemotherapy.

243
C: Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx.

Explanation: The presence of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, and immunohistochemical findings positive for CD33, CD43, CD117, CD7, and myeloperoxidase, and negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin, all point to an extramedullary presentation of myeloid cells – known as myeloid sarcoma. This is further supported by the patient's history of FLT3-mutated AML and allo-SCT. The graft-vs-host disease is significant but it primarily affects the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, not the larynx. Squamous cell carcinoma would typically demonstrate cytokeratin positivity, which was not observed here. Marginal zone lymphoma would be CD20 positive, which was also not observed in this case. Therefore, the Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx seems to be the most likely diagnosis.
C
244
B: Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma

Explanation: The patient's history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma and the presence of widespread erythematous patches and thin plaques with prominent telangiectases aligns with the diagnosis. The negative results for infectious causes, such as β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody, and SARS-CoV-2 eliminate other options. Furthermore, the CD56 immunostaining that labels intravascular atypical cells, further corroborates the involvement of NK/T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma is the most plausible diagnosis.

C: Change the LV pacing configuration

Explanation: Biventricular pacing aims to synchronize ventricular contractions and improve cardiac function. Alternating QRS morphologies on ECG may imply inconsistent capture of the LV myocardium. Given the alteration of QRS morphology seen during threshold testing and the unchanged position of the pacing leads on chest radiography, a potential ineffective LV pacing configuration is likely. The patient’s unfavorable response to treatment may result from this ineffective LV capture. Hence, reprogramming the LV pacing configuration should be considered first to ensure consistent LV capture. Furthermore, the first step before considering more invasive options such as LV lead repositioning should be less invasive measures such as refreshing device programming. Thus, the next step would be to modify the LV pacing configuration (option C). Suppressing premature ventricular contractions (option A) and increasing the basal pacing rate (option B) wouldn't address the inconsistent LV capture. Refer for LV lead repositioning (option D) may be an option if changing the configuration doesn't improve the situation, but it is a more invasive approach and should not be the first step.

246
C: Trigeminal trophic syndrome

Explanation: Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) typically presents as unilateral facial ulcerations, often following a stroke affecting the trigeminal nerve, which fits our patient's presentation. Post-stroke TTS can occur following damage to the brain stem, particularly the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract, similar to what is seen on the patient's MRI. Reflective of a dysesthesia following trigeminal nerve lesion leading to self-mutilation, patients with TTS often report abnormal sensations like numbness or burning pain, as this patient did. 

Unlike TTS, Giant cell arteritis would present with systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, and vision changes and would likely affect temporal arteries. Herpes zoster would present with a vesicular rash and dermatomal pain rather than progressive ulcerations. Pyoderma gangrenosum would not be limited to one side of the face and is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis, neither of which this patient reports.

247
D: Check antiphospholipid antibody levels. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of visual symptoms due to retinal artery occlusion, along with a history of migraine headaches, hypertension, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, raises the suspicion for vasculitic or thromboembolic disease. The cotton-wool spot might be explained by microvascular occlusions and the presence of aortic valve vegetations is suggestive of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, seen in conditions associated with a hypercoagulable state such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS leads to arterial and venous thrombosis, including retinal artery occlusion, and can cause valvular vegetations. Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–β2-glycoprotein I antibodies (criteria antiphospholipid antibodies) is recommended to establish the diagnosis of APS. Although the patient’s positive dsDNA antibody level is concerning for lupus, the rest of the autoimmune workup was negative and there is no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus based on the history provided; the positive dsDNA antibody level may be seen in APS in isolation. Systemic corticosteroids are not indicated in the absence of systemic inflammation. Although antibiotic therapy is administered for suspected bacterial endocarditis, the negative blood cultures and absence of systemic inflammation make this less likely. Anticoagulant therapy could be considered for valvular vegetations and arterial occlusions, but the underlying hypercoagulability should be addressed first.

248
C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast

Explanation: This patient presents a classic case of a complex ocular motility disorder due to his inability to elevate his right eye and abduct his left eye. This suggests the involvement of both oculomotor (third cranial) and abducens (sixth cranial) nerves. This form of diplopia, called vertical diplopia, typically arises from a lesion at the nucleus or fascicle of the cranial nerves, making a central nervous system pathology a strong consideration. 

His symptoms are not consistent with a myasthenic disorder since he lacks fatigability and improvement in ptosis with rest, and the symptoms are not episodic. Orbital pseudotumor often presents acutely, but it would typically show signs of proptosis, pain, and inflammation, which this patient lacks. Similarly, Giant Cell Arteritis can present with diplopia but is associated with headache, jaw claudication, and abnormalities in lab results such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, which this patient is not noted to have. Thus the best next step in this patient's care would be Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the orbits with contrast in order to better investigate potential neuropathic causes.

D: Continue acetazolamide and repeated Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months. 

Explanation: The case describes bilateral disc edema, which is typically managed initially with acetazolamide as part of a regimen aimed at reducing intraocular pressure. In conjunction with this, regular monitoring of the patient’s visual fields and retinal nerve fiber layer through Humphrey visual fields testing and optical coherence tomography is required to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and note any changes in his condition. High-dose corticosteroids (Option C) would not normally be administered unless there is significant inflammation indicative of other underlying conditions, but the normal blood test results suggest this is not the case. Repeat lumbar punctures with serologies (Option B) may be unnecessary and invasive if the intraocular pressure is being managed effectively with the current treatment. Tighter blood pressure control (Option A) may be advisable given the patient's history of hypertensive retinopathy, but this wouldn't directly address the current issue of bilateral disc edema. Therefore, in the immediate term, continuing the current regimen (Option D) seems the most appropriate course of action.

C: Send to emergency department for admission and initiation of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy

Explanation: The patient's progressive and severe headaches, combined with the visual loss and the findings of creamy-yellow lesions on fundoscopy, are suggestive of a severe inflammatory process, possibly neuroretinitis or optic neuritis. Given the severity and progression of symptoms, immediate aggressive treatment should be initiated to avoid permanent loss of vision and/or neurological damage. Intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy is used to reduce inflammation in such scenarios. Although further testing for infectious or inflammatory causes is needed, the urgency of the symptoms necessitates immediate treatment. Oral prednisone and outpatient evaluation will not address the immediate severity of the condition. Hence, the option C is the most appropriate next step.

251
C: Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis. 

Explanation: The rapid increase in sCr levels post immunotherapy, ineffective response to high dose steroids, the occurrence of anuria, as well as abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys imply a more intrinsic renal pathology. Furthermore, the patient's histopathological image showing atypical cells in kidney capillaries and tubules strongly suggests renal metastasis of melanoma. There is no evidence of a preceding infection to suggest postinfectious glomerulonephritis. This, along with the response to the use of a BRAF inhibitor (used in melanoma treatment), supports the diagnosis of Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis and drug-induced acute tubular necrosis are less likely as the patient had not responded to steroid therapy typically effective in these cases, and the patient's condition improved after administering a BRAF inhibitor.

252
D: EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

Explanation: The patient's history, present symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results all point towards the diagnosis of an Epstein-Barr virus positive mucocutaneous ulcer. This is a low-grade, and self-limited condition associated with immunosuppression (like the one this patient has due to his rheumatoid arthritis and methotrexate treatment). The presence of EBV IgG signifies a past infection, which can be reactivated due to a compromised immune system. 

The presence of such ulcers in an immunosuppressed patient is a common occurrence. The lack of lymphadenopathy, absence of an obvious mass, and the non-detection of IgM for EBV (an early marker of infection) make nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Option A) and squamous cell carcinoma (Option C) less likely. 

Although the patient does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis, the findings are not consistent with autoimmune vasculitis (Option B), since the autoimmune antibody tests were negative. 

Therefore, the best answer is D: EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.
D
253
D: Thyroid paraganglioma. 

Explanation: The zellballen pattern of the tumor cells, the sharp demarcation from surrounding thyroid tissue, and the presence of amphophilic granular cytoplasm and salt-and-pepper chromatin in the tumor cells are all characteristic features of paragangliomas. Paraganglioma in the thyroid gland is extremely rare, but the given histologic features align with this diagnosis. Unlike medullary thyroid carcinoma, paragangliomas do not typically arise from thyroid tissue. Thus, the firm demarcation between the nodule and the thyroid tissue also supports the diagnosis of thyroid paraganglioma and not medullary thyroid carcinoma. Other options such as papillary thyroid carcinoma and hyalinizing trabecular tumor lack the specific morphologic characteristics stated here, making them less likely. Finally, the significant variations of the BRAF gene in the patient's results are commonly found in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which further complicates the case. Thus, despite the complexity of the case and the rarity of thyroid paragangliomas, the best answer according to the presented features and discussion is thyroid paraganglioma.
D
254
C: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma

Explanation: The skin lesions with histopathologic examination revealing large round cells proliferating within dermal blood vessels, along with the patient's episodic fever, suggest the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL). IVLBCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by selective growth of lymphoma cells within the lumen of small blood vessels, particularly capillaries, effectively evading the immune system. Symptoms can be nonspecific, as they are dependent on the organ involved. Skin is one of the most commonly affected organs. The presence of slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels can also be seen in patients with IVLBCL due to the systemic inflammatory response caused by the lymphoma.

D: Blau syndrome. 

Explanation: Blau syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by granulomatous arthritis, uveitis, and dermatitis; all of which are symptoms the boy demonstrated. While Ichthyosis vulgaris and Netherton syndrome could explain the skin symptoms, they don't typically present with arthritic or ocular symptoms. Pityriasis rubra pilaris also presents with skin symptoms similar to what the boy has, but uveitis and arthritis are not common in this condition. The presence of noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and neutrophil infiltration in the dermis and subcutis, as revealed by histologic findings, further solidify the diagnosis of Blau syndrome.

D: Start an intra-aortic balloon pump.

Explanation: This patient presents with symptoms and signs that may suggest acute heart failure precipitated by particularly high physical and emotional stress, known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), which is frequently associated with severe hypotension and typically affects postmenopausal women. The presentation of TCM can mimic that of acute coronary syndrome as the initial clinical and ECG findings are indistinguishable. In such cases, an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), designed to improve cardiac output and coronary circulation, may be a reasonable choice until the acute phase is resolved. Given the current evidence, it is recommended to start with IABP, as the immediate goal is to stabilize her hemodynamics. Dobutamine, nitrates and nifedipine can affect the pressure gradient and worsen the asymmetric hypertrophy, and can be detrimental if the patient has dynamic outflow obstruction. Furthermore, beta-blockers like bisoprolol are indicated in the chronic phase after the cardiogenic shock is stabilized. This suggests that an IABP may perhaps be the first line of management in severe cases, as other pharmacological options may exacerbate her symptoms or have limited efficacy in the acute setting.

A: Perform vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics

Explanation: Given the presentation of the patient's symptoms - worsening floaters, a painless central scotoma, visual acuity reduction, and the presence of cells in the posterior segment but not in the anterior chamber - the differential should include causes of posterior inflammation. This can include infectious endophthalmitis, noninfectious uveitis, or intraocular lymphoma. While it's possible that intraoperative complications or antibiotic toxicity caused these changes, the uneventful recovery and lack of anterior segment inflammation make these less likely. Due to the severity of potential infectious causes and the range of potential organisms (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses), it's crucial to obtain intraocular samples for culture and broad-spectrum testing to guide antimicrobial therapy. It is also prudent to consider empiric antibiotic coverage due to the potential severe damage caused by bacterial endophthalmitis. If the initial workup does not uncover an etiology, further steps might include systemic imaging or brain/eye biopsy to rule out intraocular lymphoma, given the patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the use of obinutuzumab.

C: Obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram

Explanation: Due to the patient's non-improvement with his current treatment (topical corticosteroids), the next step would be to gain more information about the underlying cause of the postoperative corneal edema. An anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram (OCT) would provide more in-depth information regarding the corneal structure and might reveal the reason behind the persistent corneal edema post-surgery. This could include endothelial cell loss or improper wound healing. Other options like further medical management, penetrating keratoplasty, or endothelial keratoplasty could still be considered following the results from the OCT.

A: Escalate systemic immunosuppression

Explanation: In this case, the patient's history of antisynthetase syndrome, interstitial lung disease, rash, and symptoms of ocular vasculitis, in conjunction with the presence of medium vessel vasculitis in his skin biopsy, strongly suggest an autoimmune-mediated vasculitis. Given that the patient has already been treated with high doses of corticosteroids and azathioprine without improvement in his ocular symptoms, it is reasonable to consider escalating systemic immunosuppression. Options for therapy escalation could include rituximab or cyclophosphamide, depending on the severity of his symptoms and contraindications. Intravitreal therapies such as foscarnet are typically reserved for cases of potentially infectious eye disease. In this context, infection has been ruled out with a negative infectious workup, reducing the likelihood that this course would provide benefit. Similarly, a peripheral blood smear, flow cytometry, and a whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan seem less likely to provide beneficial information given the clinical presentation and preliminary workup results.

A: Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma

Explanation: The presence of immature myeloid cells in the infiltrates and the elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels point towards a myeloid origin, indicating a myeloid sarcoma. Cutaneous lymphoma and leprosy typically present with lymphadenopathy and peripheral nerve enlargement respectively, both of which were not observed in this case. Furthermore, Sarcoidosis usually presents with systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, which is not the case with this patient. The absence of systemic symptoms along with the normal white blood cell count despite the presence of multiple nodules further supports the diagnosis of Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, which is a rare type of extramedullary tumor involving the skin but with no or very little systemic involvement.

C: Sclerosing polycystic adenoma

Explanation: The clinical, ultrasound, and histologic findings described in this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of sclerosing polycystic adenoma (SPA). This is a rare, benign tumor occurring predominantly in the parotid gland in middle-aged adults, but it can also appear in children. These tumors are slow-growing and can present as a palpable mobile mass or swelling, sometimes associated with mild pain or facial nerve palsy as in this patient's case. Histologically, SPA is characterized by a multilobulated, fibrotic lesion with glandular or ductal structures and cystic changes, which matches the findings in this case. This contrasts with the features expected in acinic cell carcinoma, mammary analog secretory carcinoma, and myoepithelial carcinoma, which typically exhibit distinct cellular features not reported in this patient's histologic examination. Given these considerations, sclerosing polycystic adenoma is the most likely diagnosis.
C
262
C: Cytomegalovirus infection

Explanation: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common cause of morbidity in immunosuppressed patients, such as those who have undergone organ transplantation. The patient's immunosuppressed state due to medications such as prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil makes her susceptible to opportunistic infections, including CMV. The presence of large fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions is characteristic of CMV infection. While other differential diagnoses like herpes simplex virus infection, Cutaneous Crohn's disease, or amebiasis can also cause perianal ulcers, they do not typically present with these histologic features distinctive to CMV. The negative PCR for other pathogens also supports this diagnosis.

C: Lupus vulgaris

Explanation: Given the clinical presentation, the histopathological findings, and the positive Mantoux test, a diagnosis of Lupus vulgaris is appropriate. Lupus vulgaris is a progressive form of cutaneous tuberculosis. It typically presents as a single reddish-brown plaque with a gelatinous consistency and an "apple jelly" color on diascopy. The condition is usually the result of direct extension from an underlying tuberculous focus or hematogenous spread from a distant site. Findings that support this diagnosis include tuberculoid granulomas with histiocytes and Langhans giant cells seen under high magnification, and the presence of noncaseating granulomatous dermatitis in the dermis. The erythematous, indurated plaque, and persistence of this problem since childhood also support this diagnosis.

C: Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation

Explanation: The intermittent wide QRS complex with an abrupt onset and offset suggests a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy or a ventricular tachycardia. An electrophysiology study would further evaluate these irregularities and whether they originate from an area that could be targeted for catheter ablation. Given that these symptoms have been recurrent for over three years, prompt intervention is required. Therapeutic abstention and patient reassurance (Option A) may not address the root cause of the problem. Medical therapies (Option B and D) might have potential side effects. The decision to progress with an invasive procedure like catheter ablation would greatly depend on the electrophysiology study findings and patient preference.

265
C: Measure serum niacin level

Explanation: This patient's diarrhea, weight loss, and skin findings are consistent with pellagra, which is due to niacin (Vitamin B3) deficiency. Niacin is required for various cellular metabolic reactions. It is obtained from diet (eg, meats, seeds, and nuts) and endogenous synthesis from tryptophan. This process is dependent on adequate pyridoxine and riboflavin status, as well as overall nutritional health. The condition is classically associated with 3 Ds: diarrhea, dementia, and dermatitis. If untreated, the condition could ultimately lead to death. The rash is typically symmetrical, affecting sun-exposed skin, and evolves from erythema to a vesiculobullous eruption, followed by thickening, scaling, and pigmentation (as seen in this patient). Diarrhea can be intermittent and may not be severe early in the course of the disease.
In patients who are elderly and emaciated with a rash and diarrhea, niacin deficiency should be suspected, especially if they have a restricted diet and evidence of malnutrition (eg, hypoalbuminemia). Niacin deficiency also results in glossitis, which this patient has. Therefore, the next step in management is to measure serum niacin level. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, niacin supplementation and dietary modification should be started.

D: Obtain serum vitamin levels.

Explanation: The case suggests the presence of ocular surface disease. Bulbar conjunctival lesions, patchy iris hemorrhages, and corneal erosions are consistent with ocular surface disease related to nutritional deficiencies, especially with the patient's alcohol use disorder. These deficiencies can include vitamins A and B, which are crucial for ocular surface health. People with alcohol use disorder often have nutritional deficiencies, leading to complications like ocular surface disease. Hence, obtaining serum vitamin levels should be the next step to validate this suspicion and amend the treatment plan accordingly.

C: Perform extraocular muscle biopsy 

Explanation: The differential diagnosis for extraocular muscle enlargement is broad and includes thyroid eye disease, lymphoma, leukemia, sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, idiopathic orbital inflammation, metastatic cancer, granulomatous polyangiitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis), infections, and more. Thus, it is important to establish a specific diagnosis prior to starting treatment. As thyroid-related investigations, autoimmune diseases, and sarcoidosis tests were negative in this patient, a biopsy could be beneficial to reach a definitive diagnosis, and direct appropriate therapy. This could aid in identifying the extent of malignancy versus additional possible diseases. High-dose steroids or radiation should only be considered after a specific pathological diagnosis has been established. Orbital decompression is generally reserved for compressive optic neuropathy, exposure keratopathy, or cosmetic indications, none of which are present in this case. Therefore, extraocular muscle biopsy to identify the cause of proptosis and muscle enlargement is the most appropriate next step.

268
D: Recommend a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient’s worsening floaters, cystoid macular edema, vitreous cell, and feathery petaloid pattern of leakage in the macula on fluorescein angiography are all consistent with an inflammatory etiology, potentially uveitis. However, traditional uveitis workup was unremarkable, suggesting a nontraditional source. The worsening floaters and CME coincide with the discovery of a mass lesion in the right middle cranial fossa that abuts the trigeminal nerve, presenting the possibility of metastatic disease in the uvea. A temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy is recommended to diagnose or rule out metastatic tumor or other brain pathologies affecting her visual symptoms. The other options (A, B, C) may be inadequate because they do not address or investigate the potential cause of the neural and ocular findings.

269
B: Perform examination under anesthesia 

Explanation: Given the presentation of the child, the best course of action would be to perform an examination under anesthesia. The child has a history of retinoblastoma and received intra-arterial chemotherapy which can have complications such as swelling and erythema. She also has a sudden exudative retinal detachment, which wasn't present before treatment. A comprehensive eye examination under anesthesia can provide a clearer picture of what's happening inside the eye. It allows to better assess the extent of the retinal detachment, status of the tumor, and the overall health of the eye. This action will help to determine whether the symptoms are related to the retinoblastoma, treatment complications, or a possible infection. Starting systemic corticosteroids may not be advisable due to the potential for systemic side effects and unclear cause of the swelling. Immediately starting antibiotics might not be necessary as blood cultures showed no growth and it may contribute to antibiotic resistance without confirming a bacterial infection. Observation alone would not be enough in this case because of the sudden and severe symptom progression.

C: Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis

Explanation: The numerous neutrophils surrounding the eccrine glands and appendage structures, displayed in the biopsy results, is classic of Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH). NEH is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that is associated with hematologic malignancies and chemotherapy. The lesions are characterized by tender, erythematous plaques and nodules often occurring on the limbs, which aligns with the clinical presentation seen in this case. The rapid increase in the neutrophil count further supports this diagnosis. Sweet syndrome and leukemia cutis could also present with similar skin lesions, but the specific localization around eccrine glands seen on the biopsy is more indicative of NEH. Urticaria is typically more transient and individual lesions rarely persist for more than 24 hours, which is inconsistent with this case.

271
B: Spontaneous lymphorrhea

Explanation: The clinical presentation of the patient: a sudden onset of bilateral neck swelling but without gas in soft tissues, absence of fever and severe pain, and resolution of lip swelling, mostly aligns with the characteristics of a rare clinical entity called spontaneous lymphorrhea. Alongside this, the radiologic finding of a large retropharyngeal fluid accumulation might possibly correspond to lymphatic effusion. Cervical necrotizing fasciitis, angioneurotic edema, and Quincke edema often bear signs of severe tissue inflammation or infection, which aren't prominent in the patient's presentation.

B
272
D: Spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

Explanation: The patient's history of anticoagulation therapy and significantly elevated international normalized ratio and prothrombin time suggest a bleeding diathesis. The patient's dyspnea, dysphonia, and dysphagia, along with neck swelling and ecchymosis, suggest a bleeding event in the airway. The imaging and laryngoscopy findings are consistent with a large, left-sided submucosal hematoma extending from the nasopharynx to the glottis, which is obstructing the patient's airway. The absence of fever, new medications, otalgia, or sick contacts make abscess, neoplasm, and angioedema less likely.
D
273
C: Follicular mucinous nevus. 

Explanation: Follicular mucinous nevus is a rare dermatosis characterized by follicular papules, often in a segmented distribution. The clinical presentation and biopsy findings as presented in the case clearly suggest follicular mucinous nevus. Factors supportive of this diagnosis include the patient's age, the distribution of lesions, the observed skin color changes, and the fact that the condition has been present for a duration of one year without other systemic symptoms. Although similar in presentation, other diseases such as Lichen striatus and Idiopathic follicular mucinosis usually exhibit different histological features. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is typically associated with immunodeficiency, which the patient does not appear to have.

B: Neurocristic hamartoma

Explanation: The large skin-color to yellow, indurated, multinodular and hypertrichotic plaque on the child's lower back indicates a neurocristic hamartoma. This diagnosis is supported by the finding of a mix of partially fusiform melanocytes and dendritic cells in the dermis on histological examination. Additionally, the presence of S100 positive cells, which are typically found in neurocristic hamartomas, provides further diagnostic evidence. The gradual growth of the plaque, its firmness and hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) differ from the characteristic features of a Becker nevus, smooth muscle hamartoma or plexiform neurofibroma. Also, the patient's medical history, including dermal melanocytosis and increased head circumference, suggests a diagnosis of neurocristic hamartoma.

B: Positron emission tomography–computed tomography 

Explanation: Given the patient's systemic symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, irregular heart rate, findings of a right atrial mass in conjunction with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, it is most suggestive of malignancy. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) enables not just localizing the disease but would also give a better understanding of its extent, considering that malignant neoplasms often metastasize. Besides, PET-CT is known to have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting malignant lesions. Therefore, it is essential to promptly identify and treat possible malignancy to improve prognosis. Opting for biopsy (C) could be another option, but it may pose additional risks, and there might be a risk of missing the lesion during a biopsy. Instead, it would be beneficial to have a complete understanding of the disease extent before contemplating any invasive procedures.

A: Order skin biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient's history of trauma, presentation of fever, diaphoresis, and headache, along with the presence of an erythematous rash, purpura, and petechiae localized to the area of injury, suggest a possible vasculitic syndrome. The primary determinants of this possibility are his localized and systemic symptoms, combined with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and elevated C-reactive protein level, all of which suggest a potential inflammatory or infectious process. 

While other tests such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody or antinuclear antibody could point to a systemic cause, or a lower extremity duplex ultrasound could identify a deep venous thrombosis, these are less likely given his localized rash and absence of other systemic symptoms. Also, precipitous treatment with antibiotics without a clear infection source or positive cultures might lead to unnecessary exposure to potential side effects. 

A skin biopsy can provide valuable information allowing for identification of the specific type of infection or inflammation and help direct appropriate treatment moving forward. Therefore, this should be the next step in the patient's workup.

D: Prescribe oral zinc therapy. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical and histopathologic features, including dorsal foot hyperkeratosis, verrucous plaques, psoriasiform hyperplasia, parakeratosis, eosinophils, papillary dermal inflammation, and intraepidermal necrosis, are in line with necrolytic acral erythema (NAE). This is a cutaneous condition associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as confirmed by her serologic testing. Oral zinc therapy has been suggested as a useful treatment for NAE, hence this choice. NAE can mimic conditions such as psoriasis, fungal infections, or warts, all of which the patient has previously been misdiagnosed with and treated for, without improvement. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (choice B) would be inappropriate as there is no evidence of bacterial infection. A CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis (choice C) would not be useful, as the patient's condition is dermatological and related to the HCV infection. An incisional biopsy (choice A) would not add useful information, as a punch biopsy has already been performed and is significant for NAE.

C: Reassure and address patient’s concerns and follow up in 1 year.

Explanation: This patient's concern is valid given his family history and current issues with forgetfulness and word-finding. Yet, his performance on cognitive assessments is within the average to above-average range and his MRI results are normal. Despite him possessing an APOE ɛ4 allele (a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease), it does not mean that he will definitely develop Alzheimer's. Many individuals with this genotype never develop Alzheimer's disease, and some with the disease do not possess the risk alleles. Therefore, his cognitive symptoms could be due to anxiety and concern about his family history and genetic risk, rather than neurodegeneration. Additional testing such as FDG-PET or CSF analyses could subject the patient to unnecessary stress and risk, while not being definitive or changing current management. Periodic monitoring (usually annually) of cognition and functional status, along with reassurance, is the preferred approach. Patient education that healthy lifestyle habits (eg, physical exercise, cognitive engagement, heart-healthy diet) may delay onset of cognitive impairment in individuals at risk for Alzheimer disease is also an important part of counseling.

B

Explanation: The bilateral nature of the ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in this patient is an indication that there could be involvement of the central nervous system or a systemic condition at play. Hence, in such a clinical scenario, it is prudent to perform a neuroimaging study, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, and with and without contrast. This would provide valuable information about any potential pathology in the cranial nerves or brain that may be responsible for these symptoms. Surgical repair of ptosis could be considered after the cause has been identified and managed accordingly. The lack of any systemic symptoms and normal thyroid functioning would rule out thyroid eye disease, and an electrocardiogram is not immediately relevant based on presented symptoms.
B: Initiation of anticoagulation 

Explanation: This patient presents with mastoiditis complicated by septum pellucidum cerebri, a form of venous sinus thrombosis (VST). VST can present with severe headaches, and in severe cases, with papilledema and visual disturbances like in this patient. The management of VST involves addressing the underlying cause - in this case mastoiditis - and anticoagulation. Anticoagulation is given to prevent propagation of the clot, to facilitate natural thrombolysis, and to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism. In situations where anticoagulation is contraindicated or if there is a significant mass effect or hemorrhage, other procedures like endovascular thrombolysis or clot retrieval may be considered. A lumbar puncture in the setting of VST could lead to herniation due to the existing alteration in brain pressures and is therefore not advisable. Similarly, while high-dose intravenous steroids might alleviate symptoms secondary to cerebral edema, they do not directly treat the clot. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement is typically reserved for patients with persistent elevated intracranial pressure despite maximum medical therapy.

B: Genetic sequencing. 

Explanation: The patient's history of long-standing retinopathy, recurrent ring-enhancing lesions and renal insufficiency may raise suspicion for a systemic vasculopathy. Given the family history of early-onset renal failure, a hereditary basis is plausible. Genetic sequencing is necessary to confirm possible genetic-based diseases such as Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The identification of a specific genetic mutation can lead to targeted therapy, more accurate prognosis, and genetic counseling for the patient and potentially affected relatives.

A: Discuss superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination

Explanation: Given the clinical history and the appearance of the cornea on slitlamp examination and AS-OCT, there could potentially be multiple causes involved, including a squamous cell carcinoma, invasion from prior squamous cell carcinoma, calcification from previous YAG capsulotomy, or involvement of a foreign body. Although a keratolimbal mass could inherit several disorders, histopathological examination after superficial keratectomy could be a reliable way to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Calcium chelation with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) therapy, penetrating keratoplasty are treatments that could be discussed after histopathologic diagnosis is confirmed. Observation with follow-up, on the other hand, might delay an essential diagnosis and potentially worsen the patient's vision.

283
C: Erosive pustular dermatosis

Explanation: The given clinical presentation aligns best with the diagnosis of erosive pustular dermatosis (EPD). EPD is a rare, chronic, inflammatory condition that predominantly affects areas of the body where there are fewer hair follicles, such as the scalp. Patients typically present with crusted lesions, as well as erosive and pustular areas with purulent drainage. It is most commonly seen in the elderly population with a history of sun-damaged skin, and it often occurs after a minor injury or procedure, such as cryotherapy. Though the pathogenesis remains unclear, it is hypothesized that damage to the hair follicles leads to an upregulated inflammatory response. On the other hand, options A, B, and D are less likely due to the absence of the characteristic symptoms and presentations associated with those conditions.

284
C: Kallmann syndrome

Explanation: Kallmann syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia or hyposmia, a result of the failure of the olfactory and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to migrate to their accurate places during development. In this case, the patient has a congenital lack of sense of smell (hyposmia) and delayed or absent puberty due to the lack of menarche. Despite these, her LH/FSH values were normal, indicating a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism where GnRH is low but gonadotropins are normal, fitting into the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome. Other conditions such as VACTERL constellation and MRKH syndrome would not account for the olfactory disorder, while meningitis would not result in these combined symptoms.
D
285
B: Eosinophilic annular erythema

Explanation: Eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE) is a rare skin condition presenting with erythematous, pruritic, annular lesions. A characteristic histopathological finding, demonstrated in this patient, is superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial inflammation with numerous scattered eosinophils. Given the patient's presentation, history of immunotherapy (which has been associated with cutaneous eruptions including eosinophilic dermatoses), and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is EAE.

286
A: Mantle cell lymphoma

Explanation: Mantle cell lymphoma is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing about 3-10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It's characterized by the proliferation of mature B-lymphocytes that have a characteristic immunophenotype, expressing CD5, CD20, and cyclin D1; the last marker has a high rate of positivity in mantle cell lymphoma, like shown in this case. The disease often presents with generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and bone marrow involvement. Cutaneous involvement is less frequent but may present as nodules, plaques or disseminated lesions. The advanced leukocytosis with lymphocytosis, the palpable cervical and axillary lymph nodes, as well as the tomography findings (multiple enlarged lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules) support the diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The biopsy showing a dense diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate and diffusely positive cyclin D1 staining further points towards mantle cell lymphoma.

B: Place a temporary pacemaker and start corticosteroids.

Explanation: The clinical scenario describes a previously healthy young adult with a viral prodrome, followed by complete heart block (CHB), a common initial presentation of cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis can present as CHB in as many as one-third of patients, often is the first manifestation of the disease, and frequently is the only organ involved. The FDG-PET–CT showing a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum, an area comprised of the atrioventricular node and His bundle, supports this diagnosis. The lack of abnormal findings on CT does not exclude the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, as around 40% of cases of isolated cardiac sarcoidosis have normal chest imaging findings. The preferred initial treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis is corticosteroids. Therefore, after placement of a temporary pacemaker to ensure a stable rhythm, systemic corticosteroids should be started.

288
C: Rett syndrome

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, including the deceleration of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions, could be indicative of Rett syndrome. The typical onset of Rett syndrome is early childhood, with repetitive hand movements being one of the hallmark features. These symptoms, combined with the wheelchair dependence, severe scoliosis, and the presence of encephalopathy seen in the brain MRI, also align with the classic presentation of Rett syndrome. Note that Rett syndrome is predominantly seen in females. Neither Fragile X syndrome nor cerebral palsy typically features the same progressive loss of skills. Turner syndrome does not match with the clinical presentation of the patient.

A

Explanation: The patient's disseminated, scaly dermatitis and edema, coupled with recent growth faltering, suggest a systemic nutritional deficiency. Checking levels of serum protein, albumin, and prealbumin can provide insight into whether the patient has protein-energy malnutrition, which is the most common form of nutritional deficiency worldwide. Protein-energy malnutrition typically occurs in the context of decreased protein or energy intake or absorption. In addition to dermatitis and edema, loss of muscle mass and fat stores, hair changes, and growth impairment are also common signs of protein-energy malnutrition. Thus, evaluating nutritional laboratory measures is a crucial step in the given context to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. Other options such as performing a skin biopsy or treating with topical steroids might assist in diagnosing or treating other conditions causing dermatological changes, but they do not address the most likely cause based on the patient's presentation, which is malnutrition. Checking urine for protein could be useful if renal disease was suspected, but the clinical scenario doesn't support this as the most likely diagnosis. Therefore, option A is the best choice for the next step in management.
A: Perform a skin biopsy

Explanation: Given the multisystem involvement, the sudden onset of symptoms, and the visible lesions on the patient’s foot and nails, it is likely that there is a systemic cause. A skin biopsy of the rash can provide critical information about the underlying disease processes, enabling a more targeted and effective treatment plan. The other options are less likely to be explanatory at this point. A tissue plasminogen activator would not account for the physical symptoms of chest pain or rash; empirical antibiotics without a clear target could worsen outcomes if the problem is non-infectious and delay the correct treatment, and surgical evaluation seems unwarranted at this point given the lack of clear indications for surgery in the patient’s presentation.

D: Refer the child for a biopsy of the lesion. 

Explanation: Given the subconjunctival hemorrhage combined with the large inferior orbital lesion detected in the B-scan, it is important to identify the cause and nature of the mass. Although an orbital computed tomography scan could give further insights about the size and location of the lesion, a biopsy would provide a detailed understanding of its cellular composition and biological nature. This could aid in diagnosis whether the lesion is benign or malignant, and guide the most appropriate course of treatment. Aspirating the lesion wouldn't provide as much information as a biopsy, whereas an abdominal examination doesn't seem directly relevant given the specific ocular symptoms and findings seen in the child.

292
D: Perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of pain, swelling over the right orbit, and a computed tomography scan depicting a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect and multiple communicating channels from the frontal sinus indicates an advanced periorbital cellulitis that necessitates immediate surgical intervention. An anterior orbitotomy for abscess drainage coupled with endoscopic sinus surgery would allow for direct access to the entire affected area and ensure adequate drainage along with treatment of the source of infection. Intravenous antibiotics should be also administered post operatively, but they alone wouldn't be sufficient for the treatment. The need for surgical intervention is urgent, thus a referral to another specialist might delay this. While a biopsy might be relevant in diagnosing uncertain cases, the diagnosis in this case is clear, and therapy shouldn't be postponed.

293
C: Refer the patient for urgent neuroimaging

Explanation: The left-sided headache, "whooshing" noise in the ear, raised intraocular pressure, and unresponsiveness to multiple treatments, including topical medications and steroids, suggest a neurologic etiology. The new ophthalmic presentations such as tortuous bulbar vessels support this refractory nature of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, it would be appropriate to explore central causes, such as intracranial hypertension or a space-occupying lesion causing secondary glaucoma, which will require urgent neuroimaging for a correct diagnosis and appropriate management. The other options mentioned, while valuable in other scenarios, are less likely to address or explain the current constellation of symptoms.
C

294
C: Perform a biopsy

Explanation: The history, examination findings, and primarily the MRI findings suggest a possible intraorbital mass. The mass is causing proptosis and eyelid edema, but interestingly not impacting the vision, or causing optic nerve changes. Although imaging can provide a lot of information about the characteristics and location of the mass, it does not definitively establish what the mass is. A biopsy is therefore necessary to establish a precise diagnosis, and also crucial in guiding therapy. The treatment strategy differs widely depending on whether the tumor is benign or malignant, and also on the specific histological subtype. Consequently, biopsy is the logical next step. Options A: Observe, and option D: Begin treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are not appropriate until a definitive diagnosis is established. Option B: Obtain computed tomographic scan of the orbits might offer some complementary information, but it would not replace the need for a biopsy to estalblish the true nature of the mass.

295
A: Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma 

Explanation: Considering the clinical, biochemical, imaging, and pathologic features of the case, the most probable diagnosis is ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma. The patient’s hyperparathyroidism, thyroid gland features, and lack of symptoms and signs of infection lead to this conclusion. Lipoadenomas are rare, benign neoplasms composed of mature adipose tissue mixed with variable amounts of normal or slightly hyperplastic parathyroid cells, they can be intrathyroidal or located in the anterior mediastinal, while retropharyngeal location is unusual. The definitive diagnosis can be confirmed after a histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen. Despite confirmation through histopathologic examination is not mentioned in the case provided, looking at all the available information, the most likely diagnosis seems to be ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma.
A
296
D: Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor. 

Explanation: The clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features in the case study indicate an adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT). AOT is a benign, nonaggressive, and slow-growing tumor that commonly affects young adults and is often associated with an impacted tooth, mainly canines. However, in this case, it was associated with an impacted premolar. The radiographic feature often shows a well-defined radiolucent lesion enclosing the impacted tooth. Histologically, AOT is characterized by the formation of duct-like structures, swirls, and anastomosing cords of odontogenic epithelium, which are all present in this case. These features differentiate AOT from other lesions such as ameloblastoma, odontogenic keratocyst, and dentigerous cyst.
D
297
C: Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome

Explanation: The clinical features presented are indicative of Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome (PFPS). PFPS is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with ovarian carcinoma and it often involves rapidly progressive bilateral hand stiffness, arthritis, and palmar fasciitis. The syndrome is characterized by palmar fasciitis and arthralgia and is frequently associated with malignancies, particularly ovarian cancer. RFPS is not responsive to treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, systemic steroid therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, reinforcing this diagnosis. Other choices like Dupuytren contracture, Fibroblastic rheumatism, and Scleroderma typically have different clinical presentation and course.

A: Benign lymphangioendothelioma. 

Explanation: Based on the patient's symptoms, the appearance of the lesion, and the results of the biopsy tests -- particularly the positive vascular channel endothelial cells for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative results for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) -- this indicates a benign lymphangioendothelioma. This is a benign vascular tumor that commonly arises in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Kaposi sarcoma would typically test positive for HHV-8, which was not the case here. Hobnail hemangioma usually manifests as solitary papule or nodule rather than a plaque. Low-grade angiosarcoma was less likely because of the absence of induration, ulceration, or bleeding, and it would usually be positive for WT1, which was not the case here.

299
C: Trial medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin

Explanation: Trial medical management is the safest option considering the patient's current pregnancy status and her desire to continue with the pregnancy. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, can help with her symptoms of shortness of breath and palpitations by reducing heart rate, reducing the demand on her heart. Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, is an anticoagulant that can prevent clot formation, a risk due to her mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation history. It's important to note, enoxaparin is generally considered safe in pregnancy. 

Definitely, any invasive procedures, such as balloon mitral valvuloplasty (option A), transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure (option B), or surgical MV replacement (Option D), carry inherent risks, including possible impact on the pregnancy. Therefore, they may only be considered if medical management fails to control her symptoms and would be best deferred until after delivery if possible. Furthermore, though anticoagulation is beneficial in patients with atrial fibrillation, it also carries a risk of bleeding which should be carefully weighed.

D: Lymphoma. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, including fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, painless lymphadenopathy, weight loss, destructive mass in the maxillary region, bone lesions, and FDG-avid lesions on PET scan are most consistent with lymphoma. Lymphomas are malignant neoplasms of the lymphoid tissues that often present with painless lymph node enlargement and systemic symptoms (so-called B symptoms), which include fever, weight loss, and night sweats, similar to the patient's presentation (though without reported night sweats). Also, the interval enlargement of lymph nodes despite antibiotic treatment points toward a more sinister pathology like malignancy rather than an infectious cause. 

Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Rosai-Dorfman disease can also present with lymphadenopathy but are typically less aggressive and wouldn't explain the anemia or extensive bone involvement. Neuroblastoma is a common extracranial solid tumor in children, often presenting with a palpable abdomino-pelvic mass and systemic symptoms but less likely to present with such extensive lymphadenopathy and the osseous changes seen in this case. Therefore, lymphoma is the most probable diagnosis.
B
301
D: Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation.

Explanation: In this case, although the patient's symptoms and imaging results seem to suggest lung cancer recurrence or infectious pneumonia, they are not definitive. It is known that certain targeted therapies like crizotinib can lead to lung abnormalities that mimic disease progression or infection. The best way to guide the patient's management is to perform a biopsy, as this could provide histological confirmation of recurrence or discover another benign disease that may be causing the patient's symptoms, such as granulomatous inflammation. This will help to decide the next appropriate steps, whether it be re-initiating treatments or managing a newly identified condition.

C: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor

Explanation: Although retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children, it typically does not manifest with elevated intraocular pressure, exophthalmos, or the rapid progression seen in this case. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary orbital malignancy in children, but the presence of an intraocular mass and intratumoral calcification or hemorrhage on MRI does not support this diagnosis. Medulloepithelioma is a rare embryonal tumor typically found in the ciliary body, rather than beneath the retina as in this case. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) often presents with a rapidly growing mass and characteristic loss of INI-1 on pathology, both features seen in this patient. In AT/RT, decreased INI-1 expression is seen due to mutation in the SMARCB1 gene which normally produces the INI-1 protein. This helps in the differentiation and diagnosis of AT/RT from other tumors. The FDG-PET evidence of hypermetabolic masses also supports a diagnosis of a highly malignant neoplasm like AT/RT.
C
303
B: Improve glycemic control due to urinary magnesium loss from polyuria.

Explanation: Hypomagnesemia is a common complication in patients with type 2 diabetes, and the patient's recent hemoglobin A1c level of 10.8% suggests poor glycemic control. When blood glucose levels are high, glucose is excreted in the urine, carrying with it electrolytes including magnesium - a condition known as polyuria. Improved glycemic control could reduce polyuria and thereby minimize urinary magnesium loss. While differences in reabsorption (option C), gastrointestinal absorption (option D), and alcoholism (option A) can cause hypomagnesemia, none of these seem to be the primary issue for this patient.

304
B: Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma 

Explanation: Given this patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma with multiple lung metastases, the presence of a new subglottic lesion could be consistent with another site of metastasis. Furthermore, the CDX2 staining initiated by the pathologist is a marker often associated with colorectal cancers, which would align with a metastatic lesion from the patient’s known primary rectal adenocarcinoma. Even though tumors uncommonly metastasize to the larynx, there should be a high index of suspicion for this patient with a known history of cancer. Other mentioned conditions like tracheal granuloma, subglottic squamous cell carcinoma, or subglottic papilloma would be less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

C: Perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias.

Explanation: In a young patient with syncope followed by ventricular tachycardia, an inherited channelopathy like Long QT syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia should be suspected. Treadmill stress testing could provide valuable information on the patient's response to exercise and whether it induces or exacerbates arrhythmias. This could help in diagnosing one of these inherited arrhythmias. Given the negative results of the tests, including those for ischemic heart disease and pulmonary embolism, the assumption would lean towards a genetic etiology.

306
C: Organophosphate poisoning 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms such as generalized weakness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and urinary incontinence followed by an improvement of consciousness within hours align with the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning. These could be due to exposure to organophosphates, a class of chemicals often found in pesticides, in her recent travel to Cuba. The presence of involuntary facial muscle twitching, muscle weakness, and jerky movements align with the neuromuscular effects these compounds have. Organophosphates inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the body, causing overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors that results in these symptoms. Additionally, the normal lab findings and negative toxicology screen further narrow down the possibilities to a condition like organophosphate poisoning that would not be detected by these tests. A CT scan would not typically show any specific findings for this condition. The other conditions (Carbon monoxide poisoning, Methanol poisoning, Fahr disease) do not fit the clinical picture as closely as Organophosphate poisoning.

307
C: Monitor closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of open-angle glaucoma, continued visual deterioration despite decreased intraocular pressure, and physical examination findings such as small tilted discs without signs of inflammation, suggest the possible presence of some underdiagnosed optic nerve pathology. In this scenario, it may be more prudent to monitor the patient closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing (Option C) to understand if there is a progressive decline or stabilization. In the current presentation, although the possibility of an underlying congenital defect cannot be completely ruled out (Option D), the recent and progressive symptoms lean towards an acquired rather than congenital etiology. Option A may be considered if there were signs suspicious of a neurological condition such as a mass lesion, though this is not clearly evident from the presented data. A trabeculectomy (Option B) may not directly address the underlying optic nerve pathology and is usually considered when medical therapy doesn't adequately control intraocular pressure, which is not the case here.

308
B: Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia

Explanation: The physical characteristics of the lesion, including its firmness, homogenous yellow hue, apparent adhesion to the bone, and lack of visible vascular or pigmented structures, all suggest cutaneous meningeal heterotopia. This differential diagnosis is further supported by features seen on the brain MRI and histopathological examination. Furthermore, this condition typically presents as a solitary, asymptomatic scalp nodule from birth, aligning well with the patient's history. The lesion's recent growth could likely be attributed to the minor trauma sustained. Other options seem less plausible: chondroid syringoma generally presents with a visible vascular network, scalp metastasis invariably associates with symptoms related to primary neoplasm; the patient has not described such symptoms. Proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus is unlikely due to the lack of melanocytic features clinically and dermoscopically.

309
D: Observe periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continued.

Explanation: Considering the chronic nature of the described vascular lesions, absence of vision changes or pain and the patient’s ongoing struggle with bulimia, an observation approach seems appropriate. Frequent vomiting can lead to an increase in venous pressure and development of these vascular lesions. This is further supported by the patient’s report that periods of reduced purging are associated with a decrease in the size and pressure of the lesions. Therefore, continuing psychiatric treatment aimed at addressing the underlying eating disorder could potentially lead to a natural regression of the lesions. Sclerotherapy, surgical excision, and propranolol all carry risks of complications and considering the atypical and benign nature of this case, these invasive treatments may not be warranted at this stage. The best management plan at this point appears to be monitoring the lesions along with psychiatric treatment for the bulimia. If the lesions change or symptoms worsen, more invasive options may be considered.

D: Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection.

Explanation: Based on the clinical description, it appears that the patient is encountering an atypical epithelial tumor. A complete posterior lamellar resection would best serve in both the diagnostic and therapeutic ends. A bulk of the tumor can be collected for histopathological analysis to finalize the diagnosis, while removing the tumor mass helps in resolving symptoms. Given the non-responsive nature of the mass to more conservative management (surgical drainage), and its continued growth and spread (preauricular fullness, focal enhancement in MRI) a targeted surgical intervention seems the most suitable. As for other options, they may be employed as adjunct treatments post-surgery, if required and appropriate based on histopathology report. But as a next step, complete resection seems pertinent.

B: Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy

Explanation: This case presents with distinctive features of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy (EDHM), a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated primarily with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but also with acute myeloid leukemia. The clinical image shows a very characteristic EDHM rash: erythematous, edematous papules and plaques that become confluent, leading to urticariform or, more rarely, annular lesions. Unlike drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), EDHM patients deny drug exposure and systemic symptoms. Biopsy findings of a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial infiltrate rich in eosinophils are characteristic of EDHM, which distinguish it from urticarial vasculitis and bullous pemphigoid where inflammatory infiltrate pattern varies. Thus, given the clinical and histologic findings, this patient's lesions are most consistent with EDHM.

B: Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids. 

Explanation: The patient's history of recent immigration from Guatemala, combined with her symptoms of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion, as well as the MRI findings suggest a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis. This disease is caused by the ingestion of eggs from the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, which is prevalent in Latin America. The location and number of parasites, as well as the host's immune response, determines the severity and type of symptoms. In this case, the nonenhancing lesion in the ventricles may represent a live cyst causing obstructive hydrocephalus. The sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and CSF drainage might indicate the death of the parasite with subsequent displacement. Antiparasitic therapy with albendazole or praziquantel, in combination with steroids to control the inflammatory response, should be initiated to kill remaining viable cysts and prevent further neurologic sequelae. Decision between medical, surgical, or CSF diversion approaches often depends on specific characteristics of disease presentation. For isolated intraventricular neurocysticercosis, as likely present in this case, medical management is often attempted prior to considering surgical extraction or permanent CSF diversion.

D

Explanation: 
This patient's dyschromic nails, exertional dyspnea, and lower extremity edema suggest a diagnosis of yellow nail syndrome (YNS), a rare disorder characterized by the triad of yellow and thickened nails with slowed growth; respiratory tract involvement, most commonly manifesting as chronic cough, sinusitis, or exertional breathlessness (from bronchiectasis, pleural effusion, or lymphatic insufficiency of the lung); and lymphedema (usually nonpitting since the underlying pathologic process is lymphatic, rather than cardiac or renal). Though this triad is present in less than half of cases, nail changes are nearly universal and should prompt consideration of the disorder. 
The pathogenesis, though incompletely understood, likely involves impaired lymphatic function leading to edema and effusions. Treatment primarily consists of managing respiratory complications and lymphedema. Some evidence suggests benefit from vitamin E.  Although the sinus CT scan revealed sinusitis, the absence of radiographic pulmonary abnormalities (as seen in this patient) does not exclude the diagnosis because small effusions and lymphatic abnormalities may not be apparent on imaging. Given the suspicion for lymphatic impairment, the patient's dyschromic nails, it is not necessary to measure serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity - raised levels can cause nail dyschromia similar to that seen in YNS.

B: Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis.

Explanation: The patient's history of recent chemotherapy with capecitabine, plus the persistence of diarrhea despite treatment suggests the involvement of this chemotherapeutic agent. Capecitabine is a chemotherapeutic drug known to cause a recognized side effect called 'Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis'. This can lead to abdominal pain, watery diarrhea and can even result in inflammation, ulceration, and wall thickening of the terminal ileum as observed in this case. Additionally, the negative infectious workup results and the severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, common in severe diarrhea cases, support this diagnosis.

D: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging. 

Explanation: The patient’s history of progressive vision loss and changes in her color vision, visual field defects, and thinning of ganglion cell layer as seen in the OCT images point to potential optic nerve damage. The patient’s glaucoma has been managed and intraocular pressure is normal, ruling out glaucomatous progression. There is no past history or symptoms signifying retinal disease, making option A unlikely. Option B is unnecessary as her intraocular pressure is well within normal limits, and glaucoma is under control. While a carotid doppler (option C) could reveal vascular contributions, given the visual field defects and OCT findings, an optic neuropathy related to an intracranial process is more likely, thus a brain MRI (option D) is warranted to further investigate for possible intracranial pathologies affecting the optic nerve. So, an MRI will direct toward the better diagnosis and management.

D

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms including scleral thinning and non-healing conjunctival epithelial defect, associated with retinal detachment and other systemic conditions, an integrated approach involving hospital admission is crucial for prompt and comprehensive management. High-dose systemic steroids will manage inflammation and control the progression of scleral thinning and necrosis. Furthermore, a rheumatology consultation is important to rule out systemic autoimmune conditions that may contribute to ocular manifestations, especially considering his history of hyperthyroidism which might be connected with autoimmune thyroid disease. The other options may not fully address the patient's condition scope or the severity of the symptoms.
C: Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma

Explanation: Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC) is a rare malignant odontogenic tumor characterized histologically by nests and cords of clear to eosinophilic cells, often accompanied by an EWSR1 gene rearrangement, which was seen in this patient. Typically growing locally aggressive, it has a high propensity for local recurrence and potential for regional and distant metastases. The radiographic appearance is often a large radiolucent mass, as was seen in this patient's scans. Odontogenic keratocysts and ameloblastomas are benign entities, and salivary clear cell carcinoma typically originates in the salivary glands rather than the mandible.

C: Pigmented extramammary Paget disease

Explanation: The histologic findings of the vacuolated cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei, as well as the immunohistochemical positivity for EMA and HMB-45, strongly suggest a diagnosis of pigmented extramammary Paget disease (PEPD). PEPD is a rare variant of extramammary Paget disease. The lesion is usually asymptomatic, slow growing and is characterized by a well-demarcated pigmented plaque, similar to the one presented in the case. Despite its benign appearance, PEPD may be associated with underlying malignancies and therefore requires appropriate management and follow-up.

B: Subcutaneous dirofilariasis

Explanation: The presence of a firm, nontender, freely mobile, skin-colored nodule containing many parasites, along with the absence of microfilariae in peripheral blood, points toward subcutaneous dirofilariasis. Onchocercoma and cutaneous loiasis typically present with systemic signs like fever, itchy skin, and swellings, and are often associated with microfilariae in peripheral blood, which were not seen in this case. Subcutaneous Hydatid cysts are usually caused by the larval form of Echinococcus tapeworm and tend to be tender on palpation, unlike the case here. Hence the best answer is subcutaneous dirofilariasis.

A: Relapsing polychondritis

Explanation: The patient's clinical manifestations suggest the presence of relapsing polychondritis. This is a rare multisystem autoimmune disease, characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation and destruction of cartilaginous tissues. Key features of this condition, as presented in the patient, are recurrent auricular chondritis (inflammation of the cartilage in the ear) causing redness and swelling, inflammatory laryngotracheal disease which could explain the sore throat and hoarseness, and saddle-nose deformity due to destruction of nasal cartilage. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and sarcoidosis are less likely in this context as the patient lacks typical systemic involvement such as lung or kidney disease. Moreover, the negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies result also argues against these diagnoses.

C

Explanation: 

The clinical and angiography findings in this patient are suggestive of proliferative sickle retinopathy, which is most commonly associated with hemoglobin SC disease, but can occur in any type of sickle cell disease. Despite the absence of known sickle cell disease or trait history, considering the patient's African American ethnicity and clinical presentation, it would be practical to order hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out the possibility of sickle cell disease. Options A and D, intravitreal corticosteroids and exchange transfusion, would not be the first line of approach based on the current presentation, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum (option B) is primarily related to changes in the skin, blood vessels, and retina and includes 'peau d'orange' appearance of the fundus or angioid streaks, which are not evident in this case.
B: Sarcoidosis

Explanation: The clinical and pathological findings from this case, including the patient's progressive upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, supraglottic edema, non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation from biopsy, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are suggestive of pediatric sarcoidosis. Although this diagnosis is rare in children, it can cause multiorgan granulomatous inflammation, frequently involving the lungs, skin, and eyes, but can also affect any organ. In this particular case, the patient's angiotensin-converting enzyme levels and titers for common autoimmune and infectious diseases were normal, which helped exclude other diagnoses such as tuberculosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and epiglottitis. Also, the patient's parents had been treated for latent tuberculosis, thus lowering the likelihood of tuberculosis. Therefore, the diagnosis of pediatric sarcoidosis is the most clinically plausible and consistent with the available information from this case.
B
323
B

Explanation: The presence of a unilateral asymptomatic retinal mass in this child is concerning for a possible ocular neoplasm, such as retinoblastoma, which can be life- and vision-threatening. Given the high stakes, an urgent evaluation under anesthesia and additional imaging library (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging) should be conducted promptly to ensure proper diagnosis and management. Although retinal masses can occasionally occur as part of systemic syndromes or infection/inflammation, the absence of other systemic or ocular abnormalities makes these possibilities less likely in this patient. Monitoring clinically without further immediate evaluation could potentially delay diagnosis and treatment of a serious ocular condition.
C. The best next step is to perform blood cultures and provide antibiotic therapy. The characteristics of the mass and the patient’s clinical picture suggest that this is a case of infective endocarditis. The mobile mass detected on the tricuspid valve is suggestive of a vegetation, a classic sign of infective endocarditis. Additionally, the significant elevations in prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer, along with a reduced fibrinogen level, raise the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation, a condition that can complicate severe infections like endocarditis. Therefore, starting the patient on antibiotic therapy after obtaining blood cultures is the most appropriate next step. The use of PET-CT, immediate surgery, or anticoagulation therapy only, might be considered in specific scenarios, but is not the first line of action in this case. Antibiotic therapy is the primary treatment for infective endocarditis, and should be initiated immediately after blood cultures are drawn. Surgery is typically reserved for cases where antibiotic therapy fails, or in cases with certain complications, and given that there is a lack of severe symptoms or complications, it is not the primary course of action in this scenario.

C: Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF 

Explanation: Given the persistent and severe skin eruption despite the use of systemic corticosteroids, which included new blister formation after prednisone discontinuation, there is a strong need for further diagnostic evaluation. The negative result of the first DIF testing does not preclude a diagnosis of autoimmune blistering disease, as false negatives can occur in the setting of concurrent or recent prednisone use. A new biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and direct immunofluorescence is necessary to evaluate for histopathologic changes of bullous disease and confirm a diagnosis. Meanwhile, using another PD-1 inhibitor might not be the best option due to the possibility of triggering a similar adverse immune reaction. Providing fluids and wound care are supportive interventions that don't address the underlying condition. Finally, topical triamcinolone would not likely be sufficient to treat the severity and extent of the patient's cutaneous eruption. Hence, repeating the biopsy is the most appropriate next step.

326
C: No stenosis or plaque. Because of high negative predictive value, no further testing is necessary.

Explanation: Given the patient's age and the lack of significant abnormalities in the coronary CT angiography results, there is no immediate need for further invasive testing. Coronary CT angiography has an excellent negative predictive value, meaning the likelihood of coronary artery disease existing despite a negative test is low. However, the presence of atypical chest pain still warrants careful monitoring and appropriate management of her known risk factors, such as hypertension and familial history of CAD. Also, the patient's symptoms should continue to be evaluated and, if worsened, further testing may become necessary. The overall goal is to manage her symptoms and prevent the potential future development of CAD.

327
B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation fits the description of cancer-associated pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis (PPP) syndrome. This rare paraneoplastic syndrome is characterized by the triad of pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis, caused by the release of pancreatic enzymes due to the presence of an underlying malignancy. The patient's symptoms including joint pain and swelling, skin nodules (panniculitis) predominantly on the legs, pancreatitis with extremely high levels of lipase and amylase, and the findings on the bone CT scan all point to this diagnosis. Additionally, normal levels of cancer antigen 19-9 help rule out other pancreatic conditions such as pancreatic cancer. Therefore, PPP syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.
C: Advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology 

Explanation: The patient's elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count, severe anemia, lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and high IgM level suggest a possible hematological disorder. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that might be beneficial in such cases to remove the abnormally high proteins and antibodies from the blood. This recommendation should be pursued in consultation with an oncologist given the high suspicion for a hematologic malignancy, which could be causing the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. The option of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is not preferred as it wouldn't address the potential root cause which appears to be hematological. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals would not be advised given there's no clear evidence of an infectious cause. A hypercoagulability workup might be helpful, but the blood findings strongly point towards a hematological issue which makes plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology a more urgent approach.

A: Juxtafacet cyst

Explanation: The combination of the woman's symptoms (globus sensation, dysphagia, localized swelling) along with the cyst's communication with the atlantoaxial joint as seen on both the CT and MRI, most closely aligns with a juxtafacet cyst. This is a synovial cyst that typically presents in the cervical spine and can cause symptoms such as dysphagia when it becomes large enough to compromise the pharyngeal space. A mucus retention cyst often presents in the sinuses, a Tornwaldt cyst is a benign nasopharyngeal lesion and doesn't typically interact with spinal structures, and a spinal bronchogenic cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that is usually found in the mediastinum.
A
330
B: Photocoagulate lesions with argon laser at slitlamp evaluation

Explanation: The findings in this case, including abnormal iris vessels, transient vision loss, and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) with hyphema, are consistent with iris microhemangiomas. The first-line management of symptomatic iris microhemangiomas is laser photocoagulation, represented by option B. This choice aims to photocoagulate the abnormal vessels, reducing the risk of recurrent hyphema and vision loss. Moreover, laser treatment is a less invasive procedure compared to an iridocyclectomy (option D), which involves surgical excision and is typically reserved for cases unresponsive to laser treatment. Option C, intravitreal bevacizumab injections, might also be a viable choice for reducing neovascularization, but it's generally less effective for iris microhemangiomas than laser therapy. Lastly, surveillance without intervention (Option A), could lead to frequent episodes of vision loss and elevated IOP, compromising the patient's quality of life. Hence, laser photocoagulation is the most appropriate next step.

331
B: IgG4-related disease 

Explanation: The presentation of this patient, with progressive nasal obstruction and saddle nose deformity along with histopathologic findings of prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and elevated IgG4 absolute count, are characteristic of IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease is a fibroinflammatory condition that can affect multiple organ systems and is characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform (spiral) fibrosis, and frequently, elevated serum IgG4 concentrations. Other diagnostic possibilities such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis, and chronic lymphoplasmacytic rhinosinusitis are less likely given the absence of notable eosinophilia, vasculitis, or systemic symptoms.
B
332
C: Urgently start high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during hospitalization.

Explanation: This patient's clinical picture of chest pain, elevated troponin level, and the provided electrocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging findings are suggestive of myocarditis, likely secondary to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome). This disease is a form of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies–negative vasculitis that is typified by asthma, blood and tissue eosinophilia, and extrapulmonary involvement, including the cardiac symptoms shown by this patient. The presence of significant blood and tissue eosinophilia eliminates the possibility of lupus myocarditis. The myocardial damage caused by the infiltration and degranulation of eosinophils can lead to fatal outcomes, thus, urgent treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids is necessary to prevent further damage. In addition, given the presence of diffuse pericardial thickening and effusion, this patient likely also has pericarditis, for which colchicine and NSAIDs could be beneficial.

333
B: Erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides

Explanation: The description of the lesions, histopathological features including epidermal hyperplasia, spongiosis, parakeratosis, atypical lymphocytic infiltrate, and Pautrier microabscesses suggest a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. The pattern of the eruption, described as annular, arcuate, serpiginous, and red scaling plaques in a concentric arrangement, is highly suggestive of an erythema gyratum repens-like pattern, which occasionally occurs in association with mycosis fungoides. Furthermore, the partial improvement with topical corticosteroid treatment is consistent with the typical response of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, such as mycosis fungoides, to such therapy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides (option B).

334
D: Genetic testing.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive, decreased, patchy pigmentation of both eyes, constant photophobia, constant decreased visual acuity, and iris atrophy may indicate an inherited condition, possibly pigment dispersion syndrome or iris hypopigmentation syndrome. Genetic testing can help confirm this suspicion, further elucidate the cause of his symptoms, and guide management. While the other options may be useful in certain cases, none of them directly addresses the symptoms described. Anterior segment fluorescein angiography may help evaluate the eye's blood vessels, but is unlikely to provide definitive diagnosis. Aqueous tap is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for a suspicion of infectious or inflammatory conditions, which seems less likely given the patient's clinical picture. Lastly, sickle cell testing may be indicated given the patient's race, but the absence of other known sickle cell symptoms makes this less likely to be the cause.

335
C: Persistent trigeminal artery. 

Explanation: A Persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) is a rare anatomical variant where a fetal circulation artery persists into adulthood. It's the most common type of persistent carotid-basilar anastomosis, which occurs when an artery that typically disappears after birth remains. While generally asymptomatic, certain features in imaging examinations can point towards a diagnosis of PTA. In this case, the enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath is suggestive of a persistent artery, in particular, the PTA. The other options such as Schwannoma, Paraganglioma, and Persistent hypoglossal artery are less likely as they would present different characteristics on an imaging study.
D
336
B: Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain

Explanation: Given the patient's history of headaches, recent subjective fever, and unusual ocular findings, it's crucial to exclude central nervous system involvement. The presence of floaters, intraretinal hemorrhages, and retinal neovascularization could suggest a vasculitic process, which in this case could be associated with a central nervous system condition, necessitating an MRI and MRA of the brain. Also considering her family history of antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause an increased chance of developing clots within the blood vessels, neuroimaging would be appropriate. Option C (vitreous tap) is not the first choice because the patient does not show signs of infectious uveitis (no eye pain or light sensitivity). Options A (observe the patient) and D (Administer an intravitreal injection of foscarnet) would be inappropriate because this syndrome requires diagnosis and immediate treatment rather than observation, and intravitreal foscarnet is used for therapy in viral retinitis, not in the suspected vasculitic process.

337
B: Test for vitamin A deficiency, with additional conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits

Explanation: This patient's progressive diffuse redness and tearing suggests chronic ocular surface inflammation. Combined with her finding of conjunctival keratinization, neovascularization, and fornix shortening, there is suspicion for cicatricial disease such as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or cicatrizing conjunctivitis due to vitamin A deficiency. The patient does not have features to indicate vitamin A deficiency such as malnutrition or gastrointestinal procedures. Hence, pathological evaluation and testing for immune deposits would prove beneficial in confirming the diagnosis. Starting treatment with just artificial tears or observing after stopping the drops may not fully address the problem. An extensive excision before confirming the diagnosis could be premature and possibly cause unnecessary complications.

A: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Explanation: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis), leading to various symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and evidence of kidney involvement, such as hematuria and proteinuria. The presence of lung nodules also suggests GPA. Furthermore, this lady's necrotic and ulcerated lesions, particularly the pattern of sparing in the nasolabial folds, are indicative of GPA. Drug-induced vasculitis could be a consideration, however the long-term stability on her current medications makes this less likely. The other options like Cryptococcal infection and Sweet syndrome aren't consistent with the clinical picture and lab findings.
D

339
B: Check rheumatoid factor (RF)

Explanation: This patient's chronic back pain and peripheral arthritis with prolonged morning stiffness, along with radiographic evidence of MCP and sacroiliac joint involvement, suggests inflammatory back pain, most likely due to ankylosing spondylitis (AS). However, the absence of HLA-B27, normal inflammation markers, and atypical presentation (eg, onset at an older age, symmetric arthritis) make this diagnosis less certain. Instead, his symmetric polyarthritis, MCP involvement, and hand joint erosions suggest rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that primarily involves the synovial joints, leading to progressive, symmetric erosions and joint destruction. Hand joints, especially the MCP and PIP joints, are commonly affected. Therefore, checking the rheumatoid factor, an antibody often found in patients with RA, would be the most appropriate next step. Despite the absence of joint redness, warmth, or deformity, this patient's chronic back pain, hand pain, and physical and radiographic findings suggest a rheumatologic condition, and RF testing should be performed. If RF and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are present, the diagnosis of RA could be confirmed.

A: Order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 

Explanation: 

The physical examination and test results reveal an enlarged right atrium and ventricle, a fixed split S2, a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border and an incomplete right bundle-branch block. These findings suggest possible structural heart disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be able to provide more detailed images of the heart structures and assess the severity of the condition, which can guide appropriate treatment. The symptoms also indicate that the patient might have a congenital heart disease, which was not diagnosed in her childhood. Cardiac MRI is an optimal choice for noninvasive imaging of congenital heart disease. This would be the logical next step prior to considering more invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization. Other options are less suitable - ACE inhibitors may not be necessary at this time as the symptoms are not indicative of high blood pressure and referring the patient to pulmonology might not lead to a concrete diagnosis as the symptoms are primarily cardiac in nature.

B: Chloroma

Explanation: Chloromas, also known as granulocytic sarcomas or myeloid sarcomas, are extramedullary collections of immature myeloid cells that can occur in association with a variety of myeloproliferative disorders including AML. They often appear as green-gray nodules or plaques due to the presence of myeloperoxidase in myeloid precursor cells. Given the patient's history of AML and the presentation and coloration of his skin lesions, chloroma is the most likely diagnosis. Other answer options are less likely: Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer, is usually presents as a solitary, fleshy, red or violet nodule that metastasizes rapidly to regional lymph nodes. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm usually presents with bruise-like plaques or nodules and is associated with an aggressive clinical course. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome presents as tender, red to purple papules or nodules and is associated with a variety of underlying conditions including hematologic malignancies, but these lesions are not typically green or gray.

342
A: Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia

Explanation: The clinical presentation, brain and spinal MRI findings, and generalized lymphadenopathy suggest a diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. The lack of any clear infectious, neoplastic, or specific autoimmune causes, along with the patient's elevated eosinophil count point towards an underlying immunological disorder. Given a comprehensive workup didn't detect any specific etiology for the patient's symptoms, encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia could be a potential diagnosis, although further investigation is required to confirm this. Other options such as Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), lymphoma and sarcoidosis are less likely given the test results and clinical findings presented. However, definitive diagnosis would require further immunological studies or potentially a cerebral and/or spinal cord biopsy.

A

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of progressive dysphagia to solid foods, new-onset dyspnea associated with cough and fever, and radiographic findings of multiple exudative foci in both lungs, esophageal and pulmonary tuberculosis could be possible. Performing an endoscopy can help visualize the esophagus and confirm or rule out the presence of an esophageal or pulmonary tubercular infection. Options B, C, and D may not directly address the patient's symptoms or findings at this stage of evaluation. Transesophageal echocardiogram (B) is usually indicated for cardiovascular evaluations, computed tomography angiography of the aorta (C) is generally indicated for suspected aortic disease, and right and left heart catheterization (D) also pertains to cardiovascular assessments.
B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the findings of corneal edema, pinpoint epithelial defects, and Descemet folds in the left eye suggest that she might be suffering from acute chemical injury or toxic keratitis due to the milky latex of the plant she handled. The best initial management in this case would be to start with topical corticosteroids. These would help in reducing the inflammation and edema. There is no indication for intrastromal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as this is used primarily for neovascular diseases, which doesn't appear to be the case here. Antiviral medications are used when there's an expected viral infection, which is also not apparent from the presentation. Endothelial keratoplasty is a surgical intervention, which is generally considered after medical management has failed. Therefore, starting with topical corticosteroid eyedrops, answer choice B, would be the most appropriate choice at this point.
A: Edrophonium test 

Explanation: Taking into account the clinical features of the patient, these do not align very well with the common causes of abrupt-onset ptosis such as third nerve palsy, Horner’s syndrome, or myasthenia gravis. Hence, options B, C, and D could potentially be premature. In such a diagnostic dilemma, an Edrophonium test (Option A) could be helpful. This test is non-invasive and can compassionately rule out myasthenia gravis, which is an essential differential diagnosis to consider in cases of new-onset ptosis. If this test is negative, further imaging (Option C) or referral for repair (Option B) might be the next steps to consider.

C: Malignant pheochromocytoma

Explanation: The clinical features of headache, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension, and other symptoms that are episodic or paroxysmal are suggestive of pheochromocytoma, a rare neuroendocrine tumor. In this case, the patient's symptoms such as the occurrence of episodic back and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and flushing, worsening following a noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography are consistent with the adrenoceptors stimulation induced by mechanical manipulation of a pheochromocytoma. Additionally, the identification of a thoracic paraspinal mass which is common location for extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas, as well as the histopathologic feature of cells with pleomorphic round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm further supports this diagnosis.

347
C: Perform a transscleral subretinal biopsy.

Explanation: Given the severity of the patient’s condition, continued worsening of symptoms despite multiple treatments, and inconclusive results from prior vitreous biopsies and cultures, the next step would be to perform a transscleral subretinal biopsy. This procedure allows for a more substantial tissue sample to be gathered from the affected area, increasing the likelihood of making a conclusive diagnosis for definitive, effective treatment. The choice of proceeding with this method holds greater potential for identifying the specific pathogen causing the patient’s infection. Because the patient is not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, or antivirals, a specific diagnosis is necessary to tailor a more effective treatment strategy. By continuing the current treatments (Option B) or increasing immunosuppressive therapy (Option A), there could be a risk of further exacerbating the infection. Another repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy in the left eye (Option D), might not provide any conclusive evidence in this scenario, given the previous outcomes.

348
C: Cutaneous leishmaniasis

Explanation: The presentation of the lesion with an erythematous plaque and a central orange crust, together with the unresponsiveness to antibiotic and antiviral treatments, and the fact that the family lives in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast (which is endemic for leishmaniasis), all point towards the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. This diagnosis is further confirmed by the presence of intracellular amastigotes in the dermal macrophages, as seen in the biopsy specimen. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by species of Leishmania and transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly. It often presents as skin ulcers or nodules and does not respond to typical antibacterial or antiviral treatments, instead requiring antiparasitic treatment.

B: Obtain polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA

Explanation: 
The worsening of visual acuity, new keratic precipitates in distinctive coin-shaped aggregates and increased intraocular pressure despite high-doses of corticosteroid treatment post-DMEK are suspicious for CMV endotheliitis. Although the patient initially got relief from an increase in steroids because CMV endotheliitis can mimic graft rejection, the recurrent inflammation despite high-dose steroids suggests infectious rather than immunologic etiology. CMV endotheliitis could present with recurrent corneal edema and/or anterior segment inflammation, elevated intraocular pressure and characteristic keratic precipitates, often after corneal transplantation. Polymerase chain reaction of the aqueous humor for CMV DNA would confirm or rule out the presence of this viral infection in the eye.

350
C: Sinonasal meningioma

Explanation: The diagnosis of sinonasal meningioma is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging results. The presence of a whorled, lobulated growth pattern seen in the biopsy results and the intranuclear inclusions are characteristic of meningiomas. Meningiomas, often seen in the central nervous system, can occasionally present in extracranial locations such as the sinonasal tract. Sinonasal meningiomas are rare and represent less than 1% of all meningiomas. In this case, the absence of atypia, necrosis, increased cellularity, or diffuse growth pattern also suggests a benign neoplasm, which is consistent with meningioma. Unlike esthesioneuroblastoma and sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma, meningiomas tend not to be aggressive and instead display slow, progressive growth. The absence of osteomyelitis or subperiosteal abscess on the CT or MRI indicates against a diagnosis of Pott's puffy tumor.
C
351
B: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma 

Explanation: The patient was initially diagnosed with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma which was treated. However, the recurrence of a palpable lymph node raised the suspicion of metastasis. The biopsy of the thyroid mass showed positivity for p16, CK5, and p40 and negativity for TTF-1, markers which are commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma rather than thyroid malignancies. This, along with the patient’s history of oropharyngeal cancer, supports the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
B
352
A

Explanation: The patient's exertional calf discomfort and positive exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test are indicative of claudication, a classic symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a condition that results from atherosclerotic disease in the arteries of the lower extremities. The exercise ABI has a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of PAD than resting ABI, because exercise can expose borderline hemodynamically significant stenoses that might not be apparent at rest. The next step in the management of a patient with newly diagnosed PAD includes risk factor modification (eg, smoking cessation, blood pressure control, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering), antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin or clopidogrel), and consideration of symptomatic treatment with a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor (eg, cilostazol) or a supervised exercise program. Angiography and revascularization are usually reserved for patients who have lifestyle-limiting claudication despite optimal medical therapy, including supervised exercise.
B: Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology.

Explanation: The patient's history of uterine carcinoma, recent abdominal pain, and distention with ascites and an abnormal cecal base lesion raise concern for peritoneal carcinomatosis, a common metastasis site for gynecologic and gastrointestinal malignancies. Peritoneal carcinomatosis can present with nonspecific symptoms (eg, nausea, anorexia, weight loss), but patients frequently have abdominal pain or distention due to ascites, as seen in this patient. CT and MRI may reveal peritoneal thickening or nodules, omental caking, or an abnormal accumulation of ascitic fluid. This patient's rising CEA and a normal CA-125 are also strongly suggestive of a gastrointestinal primary tumor. The CEA is typically elevated in colorectal cancer, but its level can increase in other malignancies and in benign diseases; thus, it is useful in following known malignancy but has a low specificity for colorectal cancer screening. To establish a diagnosis, image-guided paracentesis with cytologic examination is initially preferred because it is less invasive than diagnostic laparoscopy. Thus, given the strong clinical suspicion for malignancy and the patient's abnormal imaging findings, the next step is repeat image-guided paracentesis and cytologic examination to increase the diagnostic yield.

B: Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris

Explanation: The presence of a well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale suggests psoriasis vulgaris. This condition can manifest anywhere on the body but frequently presents in the areas of skin trauma, a pattern known as the Koebner phenomenon. This particular case appears to be a manifestation of psoriasis occurring at the site of a previous injury, hence the designation as 'koebnerized'. In the biopsy, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia provides further support for the diagnosis of psoriasis. The lack of improvement with topical steroids could be due to the persistence of an inducer, in this case, the trauma from the injury at the site.
The other conditions mentioned have different clinical presentations and histopathological findings than those described in this case.

C: Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

Explanation: This elderly patient, despite appearing hemodynamically stable, underwent increased-risk PCI due to the presence of high-risk angiographic features (i.e., distal left main coronary artery bifurcation lesion). When sudden hemodynamic compromise occurred during the procedure, despite prompt corrective measures (i.e., balloon inflations, intravenous fluids, and vasopressor support), the patient rapidly deteriorated. In such situation, the use of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices is often warranted. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) can provide both cardiac and respiratory support in instances of refractory shock or cardiac arrest, as in this case. VA-ECMO allows the body and heart to rest while potentially reversible factors are addressed or organ recovery occurs. Therefore, initiating VA-ECMO in this scenario is a suitable course of action. Please note that every clinical scenario is unique and the chosen course of management should take into account the patient's individual circuity, clinical stability and the team's experience and resources.

B: Chondroid metaplasia. 

Explanation: Chondroid metaplasia is a condition where cartilaginous tissue forms in areas where it's not typically present. In this patient's case, the paraglottic space lesion and cartilage fragments found in his left lateral vocal fold are indicative of this condition. The lack of nuclear atypia or mitosis in the histologic specimen rules out cartilage-forming tumors such as Chondroma and Chondrosarcoma. While voice changes and strain could be associated with a Saccular cyst, the patient's videostroboscopy findings, surgical intervention, and subsequent histologic findings are more consistent with Chondroid metaplasia.

357
B: Oral melanoacanthosis (melanoacanthoma)

Explanation: Oral melanoacanthosis, also known as oral melanoacanthoma, is a variant of cutaneous melanoacanthoma and is characterized histologically by hyperplasia of spinous keratinocytes and dendritic melanocytes, which are both observed in the patient's biopsy report. The condition is more common in African-Americans and is often seen on the buccal mucosa. Its clinical presentation includes irregular, yet sharp, boundaries and brown coloration, which also aligns with the patient's symptoms. Furthermore, the fact that the lesion is asymptomatic except for occasional pruritus supports this diagnosis. The other disorders mentioned comprise varying presentations and microscopic findings that do not align with this case.

358
A: Schwannoma

Explanation: The imaging results indicate a lesion that is isointense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, enhances with contrast, and is hyperintense on the T2-weighted sequence. These imaging characteristics, combined with the patient's progressive unilateral hypoesthesia with lack of other symptoms, suggest that the lesion is a Schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors arising from Schwann cells that cover peripheral nerves. They can occur along any nerve, including the cranial nerves. In this case, the lesion affects the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3) as evidenced by the patient's lower lip and chin numbness, and its location in the lateral pterygoid muscle within the left masticator space is consistent with a Schwannoma. Neither juvenile angiofibroma, odontogenic keratocyst, or chondrosarcoma commonly present with the unilateral hypoesthesia observed here. Additionally, the benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall indicated in the imaging further leans towards a benign tumor such as a Schwannoma.

359
B: Metastatic carotid body tumors

Explanation: The characteristics of the case presented suggests a diagnosis of metastatic carotid body tumors. Carotid body tumors are paragangliomas that occur at the bifurcation of the carotid artery. These tumors are highly vascular, often splaying the internal and external carotid arteries, which is observed in the patient. This is often recognized as the classic "lyre sign" on imaging. These tumors can be functional, creating hormones, or nonfunctional; the vast majority are nonfunctional and are found due to mass effect symptoms, as in this case. It is rare for paragangliomas to undergo malignant transformation and have distant metastases. However, the presence of liver and multiple bone lesions in this patient strongly indicates metastatic disease. The intense radiotracer avidity in the carotid mass, hepatic mass, and numerous bone lesions observed in the gallium 68 dotatate PET/MRI further supports the metastatic nature of the disease. Hence, the included features align best with the characteristics of metastatic carotid body tumors.

C: Order optical coherence tomography

Explanation: Given this patient's unexplained bilateral central scotoma, the next best step would likely be to order an optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, allowing detailed observation of each of the retina's distinctive layers. This can aid in diagnosing and providing treatment guidance for conditions impacting the retina. In this patient's case, OCT can provide valuable information about potential retinal changes that may be causing his central vision loss.

B: Perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure

Explanation: In this older man with asymptomatic papilledema and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits showing signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most appropriate next step is to perform a lumbar puncture with measurement of the opening pressure. Increased intracranial pressure can cause optic disc edema (papilledema). In this case, because the optic disc edema is severe and bilateral and there are multiple signs of increased intracranial pressure on MRI, a lumbar puncture is needed to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for secondary causes, such as infection or malignancy. A normal opening pressure would suggest a diagnosis of pseudopapilledema or elevated episcleral venous pressure, rather than true papilledema. 

Option A is not the best initial step as optical coherence tomography can aid in differentiating pseudopapilledema from true papilledema, but given the patient's MRI findings it's more likely that he has true papilledema and his conditions need more immediate action.

Option C and D are also not initial steps. In the setting of elevated ICP and papilledema, venography may be performed after lumbar puncture to look for venous sinus thrombosis but it is not the first step. Similarly, prescribing acetazolamide is treatment for elevated ICP, but confirmatory diagnosis needs to be done before treatment hence a lumbar puncture is the first step.

B: Assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels 

Explanation: The heavy alcohol and tobacco use and poor dietary intake in this patient put him at risk of vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin B12 and folate, which can be toxic to the optic nerve. Therefore, it is essential to assess the serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. In addition, the specific symptoms of this patient such as gradual bilateral vision loss, central scotomas and the unremarkable magnetic resonance imaging of brain make a nutritional deficiency more likely. Liver function tests may be helpful as part of a broader diagnostic evaluation to assess the overall impact of heavy alcohol use, but they are not directly related to the patient's vision loss. Treatment with disulfiram is a potential long-term management strategy for alcohol dependence, but it is not a diagnostic test, nor does it directly address the patient's presenting symptom of vision loss.

C: Stop netarsudil in both eyes

Explanation: There is a correlation between the worsening of the patient's condition and the introduction of netarsudil. The corneal changes seen in both eyes of this patient, particularly the endothelial changes, are associated with netarsudil use. Stopping this medication would therefore likely alleviate the symptoms. The struggling response despite increased intraocular pressure from discontinuing dorzolamide also points to netarsudil as the cause. Given this evidence, stopping netarsudil use in both eyes is the logical next step.

D: Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine.

Explanation: This patient's presentation is suggestive of primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) in the context of connective tissue disease due to her symptoms, including dry eyes, dry mouth, dysphagia, and severe Raynaud syndrome (manifested by the digital color changes and ulcers). SS is an autoimmune disorder typically involving the exocrine glands and causing symptoms of dry eyes and mouth. It can cause dysphagia due to reduced saliva production and rheumatologic manifestations (although she at present reports no joint pain). SS is associated with various autoantibodies, including anti-Ro and anti-La. 

Raynaud syndrome occurs as a reaction to cold or stress, causing small arteries like those in the fingers to narrow quickly and temporarily, causing pallor, followed by cyanosis due to low oxygen content, and finally, upon warming, redness due to reactive hyperemia. In severe cases, like this one, chronic vasoconstriction can lead to digital ischemia and ulceration. 

Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, acts as a vasodilator and is often the first-line medical treatment for symptomatic Raynaud's. Besides, avoiding cold, stress reduction, and protecting extremities should be encouraged.

A: Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis

Explanation: The clinical and histological findings in this case, combined with the patient's symptoms, are suggestive of a diagnosis of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multi-system granulomatous disorder characterized by non-caseating granulomas. Cutaneous involvement occurs in 9-37% of patients and may be the first manifestation of the disease. The diverse morphologies, including erythematous and indurated plaques and ichthyosiform scale as seen in this patient, can often result in a delayed diagnosis. In addition, the neurologic symptoms reported by the patient could potentially indicate neurologic sarcoidosis, seen in 5-13% of patients and usually associated with systemic disease. The symmetric weakness, decreased sensation and reflexes in the lower extremities suggest involvement of the peripheral nerve, possibly cranial neuropathy, mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy. Systemic symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss, are also commonly seen in patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis may also be associated with increased edema and weakness in the extremities. Therefore, after ruling out other differentials, the diagnosis of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis seems most probable. Further investigations such as chest radiography, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for systemic disease.

C: Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides

Explanation: The diagnosis of this patient is most likely "Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides" based on the clinical and histopathologic findings. Histopathology shows perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates around dilated follicular infundibula, admixed plasma cells, eosinophils, and multinucleate giant cells. Positive results for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative results for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56 further support this. Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides, a variant of mycosis fungoides, is characterized by malignant T cell infiltration into the hair follicles and is often associated with a higher CD4: CD8 ratio, as noted in this case.

C: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Explanation: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection that typically occurs in the setting of weakened immune systems, for example in patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapy such as rituximab. In PML, the JC virus targets and destroys oligodendrocytes leading to characteristic lesions showing hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI scans without enhancement, in multiple foci as seen in this case. Metastatic breast cancer (option A) would typically show enhancement. Central nervous system lymphoma (option B) is also usually enhancing and more often focal rather than multifocal. A glioma (option D) would also typically present as a single enhancing lesion. So, the clinical history together with the MRI findings point towards PML in this case.
C

368
C: Obtain chest radiographs. 

Explanation: 
The lower-than-expected heart rate despite pacemaker implantation and the abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings suggest a complication related to the pacemaker. Checking the chest radiographs will help in evaluating the position of the pacing leads as the misplacement or dislodgement of the leads could lead to pacemaker malfunctioning. The radiographs can also provide information on potential complications such as pneumothorax or cardiac perforation. The other options like starting transcutaneous pacing or placing a magnet on the pulse generator are later steps typically performed when the cause of the pacemaker malfunction has been identified. Placing a transvenous pacing device might not be necessary if the current malfunction is due to a correctable issue.

A: Kaposi sarcoma 

Explanation: Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that develops from the cells lining lymph or blood vessels and is associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. The patient's history of HIV and the presence of violaceous nodules on both the tongue and lower extremities enhances suspicion toward Kaposi sarcoma. The pathological findings of spindle cells and HHV-8 staining suggest Kaposi sarcoma as well. It is not consistent with syphilitic gumma which is grossly very different, bacillary angiomatosis which is bacterial related or angiosarcoma which is more aggressive and rare. Thus, this clinical presentation, including the patient's immunocompromised state, strongly implies a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.
A
370
C: Secretory carcinoma 

Explanation: The positive staining for GCDFP-15, the presence of bland-looking cells, microcystic and papillary architecture, as well as the abundance of bubbly secretion that is positive for periodic acid-Schiff, supports the diagnosis of secretory carcinoma rather than the other options. Although acinic cell carcinoma and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma may also occur in the parotid gland, neither commonly have the described morphology or immunohistochemical staining pattern. Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, is more of a diagnosis of exclusion and doesn't typically present with the features described. 
C
371
C. Complete serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The patient’s blurred vision and the findings from ophthalmic examination and ocular ultrasonography indicate a possibility of intraocular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, despite no history of any major illnesses and no signs of inflammation. Lymphomas are malignancies of lymphocytes and can involve any organ in the body including the eyes. The biopsy of the conjunctival lesion revealed sheet like infiltration of small monomorphic lymphocytes with Dutcher bodies, which is a characteristic finding in lymphomas. Therefore, completing serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy will help confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma and determine the best course of treatment.
C: Excisional biopsy

Explanation: Considering the patient's condition and history, it is evident that the prescribed antibiotics have shown no improvement in the patient's condition. The eyelid lesion's unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy, alongside the dramatic clinical presentation, should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis. In such situations, an excisional biopsy would typically be the appropriate next step to provide a definitive diagnosis. The biopsy would allow for the testing of the lesion and identification of the underlying pathogen or ailment that is causing the eye condition such as viruses, fungi, or tumor cells. It will be particularly helpful in determining if this is a case of Varicella-Zoster Virus infection. Wound debridement or continued antibiotic therapy may not be the best options because the lesion is not responding to antibiotics and it may not be a typical wound that would benefit from debridement. A CT scan would provide useful information about orbital structures but it may not pinpoint the cause of eyelid lesion. Thus, excisional biopsy seems the most appropriate and informative next step.

C: Administer high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 3 times daily)

Explanation: The patient's signs and symptoms such as rapid progression of retinal vaso-occlusive disease in the setting of optic neuritis, disc edema, and retinal hemorrhages suggest a viral etiology, most likely herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The presence of anterior chamber cells and keratic precipitates suggests an underlying uveitis, which further supports a herpes virus infection causing her retinitis. Therefore, administering high-dose oral valacyclovir can help in treating underlying herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus retinitis. Other options A, B, and D may not provide the specific antiviral treatment needed for this patient's condition.

A: Obtain a full-field electroretinogram

Explanation: The patient's gradually progressive peripheral vision loss, difficulty with night vision, and subtle signs of retinal dystrophy (vascular attenuation and bone spicule pigmentation) are highly suggestive of a form of inherited retinal degeneration. The best next step in this setting would typically be a full-field electroretinogram (ERG). ERG evaluates both rod and cone function and can help confirm the diagnosis of retinal dystrophy. Moreover, ERG can differentiate between different types of retinal degeneration based on patterns of rod and cone involvement.

A: Surgical iridectomy. 

Explanation: The presence of multiple brown masses at the pupillary margin in both eyes without any inflammation in the anterior chamber or vitreous, and unremarkable findings of the posterior pole examination suggests that these could be iris cysts - benign growths on the coloured part of the eye that can cause vision problems if they grow large or numerous. Surgical iridectomy is a procedure where some of the tissue from the iris is removed to eliminate these growths. The other options listed (B: Kidney ultrasonography, C: Positron emission tomography scan, D: Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) are likely used to assess for other potential causes or associated systemic diseases which seems unnecessary at this phase given the patient's presentation and currently available information.

B: Change voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B. 

Explanation: The current treatment seems ineffective given the progression of the patient's condition. The presence of Aspergillus in bronchoalveolar lavage culture and the nature of the lung mass raises the question of invasive aspergillosis, a severe condition that might not be effectively treated with voriconazole alone. Liposomal amphotericin B is an alternative antifungal treatment for invasive aspergillosis. Furthermore, the charcoal-colored pleural fluid seen could be a sign of Mucor species, which may not respond to voriconazole and are generally treated with amphotericin B.

B: Actinic prurigo cheilitis

Explanation: The prolonged history of generalized pruritus, the unresponsiveness to the treatment with topical corticosteroids, the presence of erythematous papules on her trunk and upper extremities, and scales and fissures on her lower lip that spare the surrounding skin, inner mouth, and upper lip suggest a differential diagnosis of Actinic prurigo cheilitis. Actinic prurigo is a rarely diagnosed photodermatosis, innate to people who have Native American heritage. It is not responsive to standard photo protection and is a chronic condition often refractory to treatment. The dynamics of the course with persistent skin lesions and the previous histopathological examination with findings of spongiotic dermatitis also contribute to this diagnosis. Be aware that the definitive diagnosis will necessitate correlation of both clinical and pathological findings.

A: Cardiac metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma

Explanation: The presence of hypodense lesions in the apex of the patient's heart coupled with a history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma hints at metastases from the tumors. Furthermore, the treatment-related complications, including elevated levels of transaminases and an infusion port thrombosis, also point towards the burden of metastatic disease. The other options listed involve primary cardiac conditions or tumors, which are less likely given the patient's extensive oncologic history and the lack of typical clinical or imaging features of those conditions.
D
cellvalue empty
379
D: Continue medical management.

Explanation: The patient has known dilated cardiomyopathy with a long history of left ventricular dysfunction, with his ejection fraction at 30% at age 14, suggesting a nonischemic etiology for his cardiomyopathy. His presenting symptoms of angina may be suggestive of ischemia, however, the severe fixed apical defect on his stress test is most likely due to a prominent apical aneurysm, commonly seen in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, especially given the history of myocarditis. The partially reversible anterior wall defect indicates a likelihood of stunning or hibernation, and not necessarily myocardial ischemia. Absence of clinical signs like jugular venous distension, peripheral edema or heart murmur also indicate stability on medical therapy.

Through these factors, it is suggected that the management would be optimization of his heart failure regimen (answer option D) rather than revascularization (options A, B, C), as his left ventricular dysfunction is more likely due to nonischemic causes. His symptoms and heart failure should be managed medically unless future testing definitively confirms significant coronary artery disease contributing to ischemia.

C: Order cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical features, including progressive bihemispheric brain dysfunction (cognitive impairment, gait instability, visual loss), relatively normal structural neuroimaging, and only mildly elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid composition, suggest that there is a disorder affecting both the white and gray matter. This could likely be a prion disease, a rare group of neurodegenerative disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Therefore, a cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel would be recommended. The other answer options are less likely. A Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy (option A) is not fitting due to the lack of vitreoretinal pathology to justify such an invasive procedure. Prescribing aspirin for secondary stroke prevention (option B) is not the best option as the patient’s MRI was normal. Referring to psychiatry for functional vision loss (option D) would not address the other widespread neurologic symptoms the patient is experiencing.

381
C: Order systemic laboratory workup

Explanation: The woman's pathology findings show characteristic features of localized amyloidosis, which makes it important to rule out systemic amyloidosis, a multi-system disease with a possible fatal outcome. Systemic amyloidosis and localized amyloidosis can present similarly on histopathology, but they have different treatments and prognoses. Hence, every new diagnosis of amyloidosis should initially be treated as possibly systemic until proven otherwise. Therefore, systemic laboratory workup would include serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, B-type natriuretic peptide and troponins.

382
A: Initiate immunosuppressive therapy

Explanation: The worsening of the patient's best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the development of extensive exudative retinal detachments in both eyes suggest a progression of her central serous retinopathy (CSR). Immunosuppressive therapy can decrease inflammation and potentially prevent further retinal detachment. This is a more immediate measure compared to monitoring for a resolution of subretinal fluid - which implies inaction while the condition progresses - or undergoing surgery, which can carry greater risks and should be considered if less invasive measures fail to work. Additionally, no retinal tears were found in a depressed examination, indicating the retinal detachments may be primarily due to inflammation rather than structural issues, further supporting the use of immunosuppressive therapy.

383
C: Mycosis fungoides

Explanation: The histopathological findings of the lesion are consistent with an early stage of Mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Key features include marked epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and halos (known as Pautrier microabscesses), which are characteristic features of Mycosis fungoides. The immunohistochemical staining showed a high positivity for CD3, CD5, and CD8, which can also be observed in Mycosis fungoides. The negative staining for fungal or yeast elements helped rule out a fungal origin. Clinical history regarding the location and chronicity of the lesion, and its failure to respond to previous topical treatments, further supports this diagnosis. Other options such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Lymphomatoid contact dermatitis, and Pagetoid reticulosis do not entirely fit the clinical and histopathological picture described.

B: Linear atrophoderma of Moulin

Explanation: The patient's manifestations, such as unilateral atrophy and hyperpigmentation along the lines of Blaschko, starting from childhood and progressing during early adulthood, are indicative of Linear atrophoderma of Moulin. This condition typically begins in childhood or adolescence, and it's characterized by hyperpigmented, slightly atrophic bands or streaks that follow Blaschko's lines. It is a rare disorder and the exact cause remains unknown. Other options, Epidermal nevus, Lichen striatus, Segmental incontinentia pigmenti, are less likely due to the lack of other characteristic features of these conditions in this patient and the age of onset or progression patterns. Also, the histopathologic examination showed no notable abnormalities in the epidermis and dermis apart from the slight hyperpigmentation, which again supports the diagnosis of Linear atrophoderma of Moulin.

C: Rosacea-like angiosarcoma

Explanation: The elderly man's medical history, current symptoms, and test results suggest the patient is suffering from rosacea-like angiosarcoma. This condition is a rare and aggressive vascular malignancy that can often mimic other dermatological conditions such as rosacea, hence the initial rosacea treatment. The histopathological examination shows ectatic vessels with plump endothelia, consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was negative for Human herpesvirus 8, which might be present in Kaposi sarcoma, thus ruling out option A. The rapid onset and violaceous appearance of the eruptions, as well as the treatment failure, are inconsistent with common manifestations of elder abuse or telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma, discarding options B and D.

386
D: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM)

Explanation: 
The patient's history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the nature and distribution of muscle spasms and myoclonus along with heightened reflexes, and the negative results of tests for other potential underlying conditions, seem to be consistent with Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). PERM is an extremely rare but severe neurological disorder characterized by muscle stiffness (rigidity), spasms and myoclonus. SERMs is usually an autoimmune disease and is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, including thyroiditis. The negative paraneoplastic panel results and cerebrospinal fluid testing results further support the diagnosis of PERM. The continuous firing of normal motor unit potentials on needle EMG is also suggestive of PERM. PMEs, faciobrachial dystonic seizures, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease would usually present differently and would not be closely associated with thyroiditis.

387
C: Intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation in this case, as well as the patient's serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the high level of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in her peripheral blood, suggests a diagnosis of intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. This type of lymphoma invades small blood vessels and leads to symptoms such as skin plaques and lesions, edema, and fever. Erysipelas and cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis typically do not lead to such high levels of Epstein-Barr virus in the blood. Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma could account for some of the symptoms but is usually associated with less skin involvement. A skin biopsy further supports this diagnosis, as the lymphoid cells in the patient's dermis are a feature of this type of lymphoma.

388
D: Perform transesophageal echocardiography.

Explanation: Given the new finding of severe aortic regurgitation on TTE and the worrisome context, it would be appropriate to further investigate with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). TEE allows for better visualization of the aortic root and valve, which is critical in this patient with severe aortic regurgitation. In this patient with postpartum dyspnea, chest pain, and a heart murmur, further evaluation of potential cardiac etiology is warranted. Ordering a blood culture (option A) could be considered, but without a fever or leukocytosis, infectious endocarditis is less likely. Cardiac catheterization (option B) is an invasive procedure and should be reserved for when a diagnosis is more certain or when noninvasive options have been exhausted. Repeat non–ECG-gated computed tomography angiography (option C) could potentially provide more information, but motion artifacts may still limit its diagnostic usefulness. Moreover, it might expose the patient to unnecessary radiation and contrast material, especially when there is a safer and equally effective option in TEE. Therefore, TEE is the next best option for this patient to help diagnose the cause of her severe aortic regurgitation.

A

Explanation: The patient’s bilateral corneal verticillata and corneal crystals, lack of vision loss, and history of amiodarone use suggests amiodarone-induced keratopathy. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is highly lipid soluble and can accumulate in various tissues, including the cornea. The crystalline keratopathy and vortex keratopathy (corneal verticillata) observed are considered a class effect of amiodarone. The keratopathy typically becomes evident within several months after the initiation of amiodarone therapy and has been reported in 70% to 100% of patients taking the medication long term. The patient has not been using amiodarone for the 10 months prior to presentation, therefore, the doctor can provide reassurance as his condition would improve over time. No further immediate action or intervention are required as he does not have vision loss or any discomfort. Initiating corneal scraping and culture, initiating laboratory testing for immunoglobulins, and obtaining genetic test are unnecessary as the corneal verticillata and corneal crystals could be directly linked to the patient's previous use of amiodarone.
D: Consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement.

Explanation: This patient presents with extremely high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, acute significant vision loss, and nausea. She has failed medical management of intracranial hypertension as demonstrated by the progression of her symptoms despite the use of acetazolamide. This suggests severe intracranial hypertension secondary to bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST). While options for treatment could include anticoagulation, serial lumbar punctures, or optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), given the rapid deterioration and failure of medical management, her condition is life-threatening, and an immediate reduction in intracranial pressure is necessary. Neurosurgical interventions such as shunt placement or venous sinus stenting can help provide rapid decompression. Importantly, while ONSF can help reduce pressure and potentially vision loss, it may not treat the underlying cause of intracranial hypertension. Therefore, the most appropriate step would now be to consult with neurosurgery for more definitive interventions such as the placement of a drainage or shunt.

D: Perform biopsy of lesion.

Explanation: In this case, the child has a large lesion in the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone as well as the orbital apex and the right temporal lobe. Antibiotics did not yield any improvement, raising suspicion that this is not an infection but rather a non-infectious process such as a neoplastic or inflammatory condition. Similarly, intravenous corticosteroids may help reduce inflammation, but they won't give a definitive diagnosis or treat the underlying cause if it's not an inflammation. Positron emission tomographic (PET) scan could introduce needless radiation exposure at this point, especially when MRI and CT have already provided valuable information. A biopsy of the lesion could provide tissue for histopathologic evaluation, leading to a definitive diagnosis and therefore, appropriate treatment.

D: Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor). 

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a large verrucous tumor in the perianal area, along with the histological finding of a hyperplastic epidermis with a dense inflammatory infiltrate and focal multinucleated keratinocytes suggest the diagnosis of a Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor). This is a type of sexually transmitted infection that progresses slowly and can become quite large if not treated. Despite the patient not having a prior history of genital warts, it is still a possibility, especially as she does have a history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV). This condition is a rare, locally aggressive verrucous carcinoma in the anogenital region. It should notably have a benign histology which can be misleading, emphasizing the importance of correlating clinical and pathologic findings. Other options in the list are not consistent with the histological characteristics provided in the case.

C

Explanation: This woman's clinical presentation, histopathology, and rapid disease progression are most synonymous with primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. This disease is rare with severe prognosis and commonly presents with plaques, nodules, and tumors, often becoming necrotic and ulcerative, as seen in this case. The disease progression can be rapid, often within weeks to months, and largely resistant to systemic therapy. Histopathologically, it is characterized by an epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical CD8+ T cells and later stages could possibly lead to a CD4−, CD8− phenotype as observed in the second biopsy of this case.
B: Angiosarcoma 

Explanation: The case presents a woman with a pruritic, erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules unresponsive to antiviral therapy and antibiotics, suggesting a severe dermatologic process. The histopathological features, including vascular channel formation and spindle cells, as well as the immunohistochemical expression of CD31, FLI-1, and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components, are indicative of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive vascular tumor that is often misdiagnosed due to its varied presentations. Early diagnosis is essential for better prognosis and management.

395
D: Give systemic thrombolysis and admit to the intensive care unit. 

Explanation: This patient presents with signs and symptoms of massive pulmonary embolism (PE), including syncope, tachycardia, and findings of right heart strain on imaging. This is very likely secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following a long flight, a known risk factor for DVT and subsequent PE. Given this patient's acute hemodynamic instability and evidence of right heart strain, prompt systemic (ie, intravenous) thrombolysis should be administered. Admission to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and further management is appropriate due to the potential for rapid clinical deterioration. While surgical or catheter-directed thrombectomy may be considered in some cases, these are typically reserved for situations in which thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed, and they often require more time to arrange than systemic thrombolysis.

396
B: Acromegaly

Explanation: Acromegaly is caused by excessive production of growth hormone, usually from a benign pituitary adenoma. The condition is characterized by enlargement of extremities (like the change in the patient's feet), soft tissue swelling (such as the reported swelling in the patient's hands), fatigue, and changes in facial features (like the reported change in bite from overbite to underbite due to overgrowth of mandible). This condition may also cause macroglossia which has been described in the case, and this enlargement of the tongue can contribute to OSA. Furthermore, growth hormone excess can also cause enlargement of lymphoid tissue, possible causing tonsillar hypertrophy. The symptoms described include many that are characteristic of acromegaly, hence it is the most likely diagnosis. None of the other choices (allergic rhinitis, lymphoma, normal anatomic variant) are typically associated with such a breadth of systemic features.
B
397
B: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease

Explanation: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare, benign condition commonly characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and night sweats. Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and the histopathological findings of the lymph node, the diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is most plausibly made. The disease often mimics malignant lymphoma or systemic lupus erythematosus, which can be excluded by biopsy. The disease is typically self-limiting and resolves without specific treatment, although it may sometimes recur. The other mentioned diseases do not completely fit with the symptoms and results of examinations given in this case.
D
398
D: Elect observation.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's symptoms and fundus autofluorescence findings are suggestive of a drug reaction, potentially related to the patient's recent initiation of cobimetinib therapy for her breast cancer. There's no evidence of uveitis (which would suggest an oral prednisone course), vitritis, or neoplastic eye involvement (which would suggest a need for a positron emission tomography scan), and it would be premature to discontinue the breast cancer treatment without further monitoring or evidence of a severe adverse reaction. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to monitor the patient's symptoms and retinal changes closely. This decision also takes into account the patient's overall condition, the difficult balance between managing her cancer and preserving her vision, and the need for her to continue anti-cancer treatment.

399
C: Inquire about bright light exposures 

Explanation: The clinical features of this case are consistent with phototoxic maculopathy, possibly induced by an excess light exposure. Phototoxic maculopathy can present with disorders in central vision, which was apparent in the case. The central Scotoma(s) were also evident in the OCT imaging, showing specific disruptions in the ellipsoid layer. Furthermore, the patient's intake of medications could have made them more susceptible to such damage. Given the lack of subretinal or intraretinal fluid, it is highly unlikely that this is an inflammatory or infectious process, ruling out prescribing oral steroids. An electroretinogram is typically not used in detecting phototoxic maculopathy, making it not the top choice. Stopping psychiatric medications without determining their direct causal link would be inappropriate as it could compromise the patient's systemic health. Thus, this calls for an inquiry about any possibly harmful light exposure experiences, which could have led to the current symptoms.

C: Perform orbital debridement.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, in addition to the findings from the noncontrast imaging studies and sinus biopsy, point to invasive fungal sinusitis, likely caused by his advanced diabetes, immunosuppression after kidney transplant, and possibly, neutropenia. This condition is a potentially deadly infection with a rapid progression rate and requires immediate surgical debridement in conjunction with systemic antifungal therapy. Out of the options presented, performing orbital debridement is the most appropriate choice given the gravity of the patient's situation and the potentially life-threatening risk invasive fungal sinusitis can impose. To wait for improvement in renal status would delay necessary treatment, thereby expediting the progression of the disease. Retrobulbar injection of antifungal agents might not be enough to control the infection, and orbital exenteration would be considered only if there is no response to debridement and medical therapy.

A: Basal cell carcinoma

Explanation: The clinical and dermoscopic images show features that are highly suggestive of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCC is the most common type of skin cancer, and nipple and areolar skin can also be affected. The translucent appearance of the nodule, arborizing vessels, and erosion seen in our patient suggested a nodular basal cell carcinoma, which was later confirmed by the punch biopsy. While the other potential diagnoses in the choices also could present as a nodule of the nipple, BCC is the most likely diagnosis given these clinical and dermoscopic findings. Despite the strong family history of melanoma and breast cancer, the genetic testing did not show a predisposition to these conditions, supporting the BCC diagnosis. It's important to note that although BCC is typically not a dangerous form of skin cancer, any new or changing skin lesion should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.

B: Primary umbilical endometriosis

Explanation: The histopathologic findings of glandular epithelium and stromal tissue within the dermis, along with clinical presentation of a solitary, painful umbilical nodule, support the diagnosis of primary umbilical endometriosis, also known as Villar's nodule. Additionally, the presence of prominent decapitation secretion within the glandular epithelium is a characteristic feature of endometrial tissue. The lack of intra-abdominal extension or herniation as evidenced by the CT scan makes the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma, urachal duct cyst, and omphalomesenteric duct remnant less likely. Moreover, endometriosis can occur in women of any age, including the woman's age in the presented case. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine cavity, and though it most commonly occurs in the pelvis, it can appear anywhere in the body.

403
C: Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy

Explanation: The condition of this patient suggested a right-sided heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Both could have been resulted from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but a CT image showed no evidence of thromboembolism. The presence of cancer (i.e., Paget disease) and the symptoms of the lung suggest Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM). PTTM is a cancer complication where cancer cells tend to occlude pulmonary capillaries leading to increased pulmonary pressure, resulting in dyspnea and pulmonary hypertension - symptoms presented by the patient. Lesions caused by PTTM can appear as ground-glass opacities and consolidations on a CT image, as seen for this patient. Despite being rare, PTTM tends to appear in patients with adenocarcinomas - a type of cancer the patient previously had. The autopsy result with the presence of proliferated fibromuscular cells also supports the diagnosis of PTTM. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and other findings, the diagnosis would be the Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (option C).

B: Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement 

Explanation: The classic signs of pericardial tamponade are present in this woman, including increased jugular venous pressure with a blunted Y-descent (Kussmaul sign), lower blood pressure, and distant heart sounds. The echocardiogram has also shown diastolic right ventricular collapse and exaggerated respiratory variation in mitral inflow velocities, which are both indicative of cardiac tamponade. Increased creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, possibly due to decreased cardiac output from the tamponade. These clinical signs indicate a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement can provide rapid relief from the tamponade and is typically the first-line treatment.

405
C: IgG4-related related disease. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the pathological findings of the inflamed area (mixed inflammatory infiltrate and an increased plasma cell component) suggest an IgG4-related disease. This disease is a multi-organ immune-mediated condition characterized by elevated serum IgG4 concentrations and involves various organs, including the larynx. Laryngeal tuberculosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Churg-Strauss syndrome don't generally present with the described symptoms and pathological features of this case. Also, stains for infectious organisms were negative, ruling out laryngeal tuberculosis. Further immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis, supporting the IgG4-related disease.
C
406
A: Glomus tumor 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and surgical findings suggest a Glomus tumor, which is a neoplasm often found on the skin and rarely in the nasal region. Glomus tumors are typically firm and tender and exhibit sensitivity to temperature changes, as seen in this patient. Such tumors are also known to be richly vascular, which aligns with the description of the excised lesion. Although inverted papilloma, hemangiopericytoma, and paraganglioma could theoretically present as a nasal mass, her symptoms and findings are most consistent with a Glomus tumor.
A
407
C: Rhinoscleroma

Explanation:
Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, which primarily affects the nasal mucosa but can extend to involve the larynx and trachea. The presence of vacuolated macrophages containing bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions, known as Mikulicz cells, is characteristic of rhinoscleroma. This patient's history of being from Guatemala, where the disease is endemic, along with the physical findings of nasal polyps, laryngeal masses, and subglottic stenosis also point towards this disease.
C
408
C: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

Explanation: The histochemical findings of cells staining positive for CD45, CD20, CD79, CD21, Bcl-2, and Bcl-6, in combination with the appearance of large lymphocytes with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and round-to-oval nuclei having vesicular chromatin and multiple small nucleoli in the histological examination are consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This type of lymphoma corresponds to a mature B-cell neoplasm recognized by the World Health Organization. The patient in this case exhibited a characteristic diffuse pattern of infiltration in the biopsy sample, further supporting this diagnosis. Hence, the other options like Pleomorphic adenoma, Angioleiomyoma, and Mucoepidermoid carcinoma are not the correct diagnoses in this context due to the positive markers which indicates B-cell lymphoma.

C
409
D: Pneumoparotid.

Explanation: This patient’s subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum were caused by a unique mechanism of forced air insufflation into his parotid ducts, also known as pneumoparotid. This is evident from the patient's "party trick" of puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck and the fact that the patient noted pneumoparotid on both the left and right side. Also, the dissection of air into the left parapharyngeal and masticator spaces supports this diagnosis. Option A, esophageal perforation, and B, Necrotizing fasciitis, are less likely due to lack of GI symptoms or skin manifestations respectively. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, choice C, occurs without a known cause or triggering event unlike this case where a cause was identified.
D
410
D: Reassure the patient and observe.

Explanation: The patient is asymptomatic with good visual acuity. The corneal deposits are located in the far posterior cornea and there are no signs of active inflammation, keratitis, or corneal neovascularization. Furthermore, the deposits are secondary to the use of rifabutin, which is known to cause this condition. The best course of action is to observe and reassure the patient as there are no direct treatment options needed for this condition. Topical corticosteroids or antibiotics are not indicated because there is no inflammation or infection present. Similarly, a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy would not be appropriate in this case as the patient has no visual concerns and biopsy could potentially introduce unnecessary risks and complications.

411
B: Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents 

Explanation: The periodicity of the symptoms combined with detection of optic nerve swelling without apparent cause suggests the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory disorder. Therefore, broad blood testing for potential infectious and inflammatory causes should be conducted to determine the possible underlying cause, such as periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA), or even neuroretinitis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to send blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents.

412
C: Obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing. 

Explanation: The patient's retinal abnormalities and visual symptoms cannot be fully explained by diabetic retinopathy, they are suggestive of a hereditary degenerative retinal disorder. Also, the patient's systemic disorders - diabetes, hearing loss, and thyroid cancer - might have a common genetic origin. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a comprehensive family medical history and consider genetic testing. While AREDS supplementation could be beneficial for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), this patient's examination doesn’t meet the criteria outlined by AREDS reports. Additionally, intensifying the oral therapy for diabetes may not directly impact the retinal pigment abnormalities and her diabetes is already being managed with metformin. So, it is important to rule out genetic disorders that could explain all her symptoms and medical history before further management steps are taken.

A: Perform biopsy of the iris lesion

Explanation: Given the presence of a lesion on the iris despite topical corticosteroid treatment, the most appropriate thing to do next would be to better understand the nature of this lesion. One of the best ways to do this is through biopsy. A biopsy would provide definitive evidence of the cause of the patient's symptoms and would guide the next steps in his treatment plan. A subtenon corticosteroid injection (Option B) may provide relief, but doesn't address the underlying potential issue. Options C and D, looking for viral causes or autoimmune disease, are possible exploratory steps, but the most direct path to diagnosis at this juncture, given the opacity and vascularization of the iris, is a biopsy.

414
B: Perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM)

Explanation: Given the report from the EGD of circumferential rings and vertical furrows in the esophagus, the patient's symptoms of dysphagia, and the unremarkable results from other tests, the next best step in her diagnostic work-up would be high-resolution manometry (HRM). HRM is a diagnostic tool used to measure pressures in the esophagus and identify peristaltic abnormalities, which can often be related to dysphagia. While options A, C, and D may also provide some useful information, HRM is most directly aligned with her presenting symptoms and findings, and thus the most appropriate next step.

415
C: Linear IgA dermatosis

Explanation: The given symptoms and manifestation seems to align with Linear IgA dermatosis, which is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder. The nature and evolution of the lesion, clinical presentation with annular blistering eruptions, the timeline following surgery and the negative results for other conditions contribute to this diagnosis. Linear IgA dermatosis often presents with grouped vesicles and tense bullae in an annular configuration and can be triggered by surgical procedures or medications, as it might be the case in this scenario. The absence of Nikolsky sign rules out certain diseases like pemphigus vulgaris. Moreover, lack of systemic symptoms and mucosal involvement further support this diagnosis. It should also be noted, while Erythema multiforme is a possibility, it is less likely given the chronicity and scale of this patient's lesion.

416
B: Spindle cell lipoma

Explanation: The findings of the pathological examination, notably the interstitial proliferation of spindle cells within mature adipocytes extending between bundles of skeletal muscle and the mature adipocytes separated by a proliferation of spindle cells associated with thickened collagen, are consistent with a diagnosis of Spindle cell lipoma. This is a benign tumor that can occur at various sites due to overgrowth of mature adipose tissue.

417
C: Bullous mastocytosis

Explanation: Bullous mastocytosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The presentation described in the case, particularly the presence of tense vesicles and bullae over many parts of the body, healing with hypopigmentation and scarring, as well as pruritus, redness and the isolated wheals on the trunk is characteristic of this diagnosis. In addition, the dense infiltrate of mast cells in the upper dermis shown in the biopsy supports the diagnosis. This condition is typically present from birth or early infanthood, as seen in this case. Other options like dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, chronic bullous disease of childhood and congenital erythropoietic porphyria don't fit the totality of provided clinical and pathological features as closely as bullous mastocytosis does.

A: Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use

Explanation: The first step in treating a patient with a first episode of psychosis, as in this case, is to consider the risk of adverse events with medication use, which could include extrapyramidal side effects, metabolic syndrome, or the risk of worsening psychosis. It is also important to consider which drugs are approved for use in first-episode psychosis. Although both olanzapine (B) and clozapine (C) could be considered as treatments, these are generally used in cases where other antipsychotic medications have failed, and clozapine is typically reserved for refractory cases due to its risk of agranulocytosis. Additionally, according to NICE guidelines, a psychological intervention such as cognitive behavioral therapy (D) should be offered alongside pharmacotherapy. Therefore, while the other options might be part of a treatment plan in the future, it's crucial to first examine the risks and approved medications. This will guide the formulation of a patient-centered management plan.

B: Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma 

Explanation: The symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings of this patient suggest systemic high-grade lymphoma with bone-marrow involvement. The high ferritin and LDH levels, and the pancytopenia are supportive of a hematological disease. The patient also displayed symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss which may suggest a lymphoma. Furthermore, CT results showed splenomegaly and PET-CT imaging depicted a highly metabolic skeleton which suggested advanced bone marrow involvement. Lastly, the bone marrow biopsy revealed a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells which strongly expressed Pax-5, a B-cell marker. All these findings led to a diagnosis of bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma.

B: Ambulatory cardiac monitoring after electrolyte repletion.

Explanation: Owing to her history of bulimia, the patient has underlying electrolyte derangements, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, that can precipitate dangerous cardiac arrhythmias, such as her presenting wide complex tachycardia. The controlling and monitoring of her electrolyte imbalances would be needed at this stage, hence option B. The absence of a family history of sudden cardiac death makes it less likely she has an inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Given normal biventricular size and function on the echocardiogram, it is also less likely that this arrhythmia was driven by structural heart disease, making options A, C, and D less probable. The fact that she responded to electrical cardioversion and her rhythm stabilised following this, further suggests a primary electrical problem precipitated by electrolyte imbalance.

421
C: Lateral saccular cyst. 

Explanation: The given case represents a neonate with stridor and respiratory distress at birth where a large submucosal mass was identified during intraoperative evaluation. Among the given diagnosis options, Lateral saccular cyst is the most consistent with the symptoms and clinical findings. Lateral saccular cysts are benign laryngeal lesions that often present at birth or within the first month of life with stridor, respiratory distress, dysphagia or failure to thrive. The cyst typically appears as a large, soft, and fluctuant unilateral laryngeal mass ideally picked up through a laryngoscopy, which is in line with the findings in the case. The other conditions like granular cell tumor and laryngeal neurofibroma are typically less likely in neonates and may not present with immediate respiratory distress, while a macrocystic lymphatic malformation usually has a characteristic multicystic appearance which isn't mentioned in this case.
C
422
D: Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation: Given the history of the patient and characteristics of the tumor, including the location, size, and morphology, as well as the expression of myogenin-positive spindle cells, desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells, the diagnosis most likely to be is a Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor that often presents with spindle-cell features. In this case, the spindle cells were positive for myogenin, a marker for rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, which further leads to the diagnosis of spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.
D
423
C: Cutaneous bronchogenic cyst

Explanation: Cutaneous bronchogenic cysts (CBCs) are rare, benign congenital anomalies arising from aberrant embryonic development. Most CBCs present as solitary, asymptomatic nodules, typically in the midline of the anterior chest or neck. Unlike the other options, CBCs are not associated with hair content (eruptive vellus hair cyst), anatomic path (thyroglossal duct cyst), or overlying skin changes (midline anterior neck inclusion cyst). The lesion's position on the midline neck, lack of connection with deeper structures as seen on ultrasound, and appearance are all consistent with this diagnosis.
D
424
B: Hibernoma

Explanation: Based on the clinical findings and description of the histopathological examination, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient seems to be Hibernoma. Hibernomas are rare benign adipose tissue tumors that display a brown fat origin, thus the characteristic appearance of uniform univacuolar to multivacuolated granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli. Classic Lipomas usually present with mature fat cells and minimal atypia. Liposarcoma usually show significant atypia and lipoblasts, which aren't presented here. Angiolipomas comprise mature adipose tissue and frequently have small blood vessels, but lack the specific cell description outlined for this patient. Therefore, based on these individual characteristics, Hibernoma seems like the most fitting diagnosis.
B
425
B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture.

Explanation: The sudden loss of vision and the findings from the clinical examination, including bilateral choroidal effusions with diffuse serous retinal detachments and white-centered intraretinal hemorrhages, require further investigation. Neuro-imaging and lumbar puncture will help exclude possible central nervous system involvement or meningitis. While ATRA and arsenic trioxide can cause retinoic acid syndrome and could potentially lead to eye complications, it is essential to rule out any other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. It would be premature to stop ATRA treatment or start steroids without first gaining a clearer understanding of the patient's clinical scenario. Similarly, testing for HLA-B51 appears unnecessary at this stage as it is associated with Behcet’s disease, which does not seem likely based on the case history provided.

426
B: Administer intravitreal foscarnet and admit for intravenous acyclovir

Explanation: The patient’s presentation is highly suspicious for necrotizing herpetic retinitis, which can arise due to Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), or less commonly Cytomegalovirus (CMV). His history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, bone marrow transplant, and absent use of immunosuppressive medication contributes to a high risk for developing opportunistic ocular infections. Therefore, emergent intervention is needed to salvage any remaining vision and prevent further progression. Intravitreal foscarnet is broadly active against HSV, VZV, and CMV and is the most indicated intravitreal drug in this case due to diverse differential diagnosis that includes these viruses. While waiting for laboratory results, systemic antiherpetic therapy such as intravenous acyclovir should be initiated due to the severity of necrotizing herpetic retinitis and given that disease progression can potentially lead to retinal detachment or optic atrophy. As the disease might also be due to VZV or CMV, oral Valganciclovir would typically be started, however, given the severity of the case, intravenous acyclovir is chosen. Should the detailed diagnostic workup rule out HSV and VZV, treatment can be further adjusted. Options A, C, and D are less preferred given the presentation and differential diagnosis. Clindamycin doesn't cover Herpes family viruses, while anti-VEGF alone would not treat the underlying infection, and panretinal photocoagulation is typically reserved for proliferative stages of retinal diseases.

427
B: Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion.

Explanation: With the patient's medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and bladder cancer, and given the lesion's resistance to oral prednisone and presence of large, dilated, feeding vessels, a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion is most appropriate. Intralesional corticosteroids (option A) are usually used for inflammatory lesions, but the current lesion has not responded to systemic steroids. Topical antibiotics (option C) are generally used for bacterial infections, and there is no indication of any infectious process here. MRI of the brain and orbits (option D) is typically needed when there is a suspicion of orbital or intracranial extension, but ocular ultrasonography in this case revealed no intraocular involvement. Therefore, the best next step is to accurately diagnose the nature of this lesion through a biopsy.

428
A: Start topical antibiotics

Explanation: The test results showed that the patient tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli, both bacterial infections, in the ulcer of his left cornea. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to start topical antibiotics to combat these bacteria. The viral PCR and potassium hydroxide tests came back negative, which suggests that there is no viral infection present. Therefore, there does not seem to be a need for antiviral therapy at this stage. However, close monitoring of the patient's condition would be necessary, and additional treatments may be necessary if the bacterial infection does not improve or if other symptoms arise.

429
B: Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin therapy

Explanation: Considering the breadth of symptoms, the ineffective response to various therapies, and the lack of evidence suggesting a specific alternative diagnosis, this may suggest a systemic autoinflammatory disorder. Specifically, Adult-Onset Still Disease (AOSD) might be a consideration, which often leads to intense inflammation and can manifest with arthritis, fevers, and systemic involvement like gastroenteropathy (manifesting as diarrhea and weight loss, among other symptoms). Treatment strategies involve the reduction of systemic inflammation, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy might be considered a potential therapy option. Intense inflammatory response coupled with lack of specificity in medical findings suggests that a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory therapy is warranted. This conclusion is further bolstered by the normal results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing which suggest neither infections nor malabsorptive syndromes. 

Moreover, the patient is noted to have previously been treated with a variety of therapies designed to curb his recurrent inflammation, but to little avail. This makes it less likely that he has a condition that would be amenable to antimicrobial treatment (choice A), and while genetic testing for a hematologic malignancy (choice C) or referral for education on a gluten-free diet (choice D) might be components of the broader diagnostic strategy, in the context of his presentation, they are less likely to deliver clinical improvement or be the first next step. While these modalities might be considered in the follow-up, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (choice B) would be the potential immediate consideration given the available information.

A: Prescribe anthelminthic therapy alone

Explanation: 

This patient's presentation and findings on imaging and ERCP are consistent with hepatobiliary ascariasis, which is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, a roundworm that is common in the tropics. The disease typically starts when humans ingest fecally contaminated food or water that contains Ascaris eggs. The ingested eggs travel to the small intestine, where they hatch into larvae. The larvae then penetrate the small intestine wall and enter the bloodstream, eventually reaching the liver and bile ducts. This migration can result in abdominal pain, jaundice, and even pancreatitis.

Given the patient's Pacific Islander background and the discovery of worms within her biliary tract, the best course of action would be to prescribe anthelminthic therapy alone. Anthelminthic drugs (eg, albendazole or mebendazole) are the treatment of choice to kill the worms. The worms will then decompose and be eliminated in the stool. 

Although antibiotics are often prescribed alongside anthelminthic treatment to prevent secondary bacterial infections in some cases of ascariasis, in this case, the patient does not appear to show signs of infection (ie, sepsis or cholangitis). Therefore, antibiotic therapy may not be necessary initially and anthelminthic therapy alone could be sufficient.

PCR and serological testing for Ascaris are unlikely to be useful in this case. PCR would be unnecessary since the diagnosis has virtually been made by direct visual inspection during ERCP. Regarding serological testing, it could be helpful in patient with suspected ascariasis but negative stool tests. However, this patient has already undergone ERCP which is the most accurate diagnostic test and confirmed the presence of the worms. Therefore, serologic testing is not needed.

431
C: Discontinue ibuprofen

Explanation: The problem appears to be associated with the use of ibuprofen. The patient experienced a similar eruption last year after taking a cold medication that contained ibuprofen, and she recently took over-the-counter ibuprofen. Therefore, discontinuing ibuprofen is the logical next step in this situation, as it is likely that the patient has a sensitivity or allergic reaction to this medication. Other treatments or interventions, like administering valacyclovir, discontinuing cosmetics or administering antibiotics May not be sufficient or necessary if the trigger (ibuprofen) is still present. Also, no other skin or mucosal lesions are present and she is otherwise well-appearing and afebrile, further suggesting that the reaction is localized and specifically related to the ibuprofen.

432
B: Late cutaneous bilharziasis

Explanation: The clinical presentation and histologic findings are indicative of a cutaneous manifestation of a Schistosoma haematobium infection or late cutaneous bilharziasis. The presence of the characteristic terminal spine on microscopic examination of the biopsy and the patient's geographical location strongly suggest Schistosoma haematobium, which is endemic in Malawi. The girl's lesion could be due to the deposition of schistosome eggs in the skin. Additionally, the lack of systemic symptoms, lack of pulmonary or gastrointestinal involvement and the specific location of the lesion further point towards a diagnosis of late cutaneous bilharziasis. Other options including Onchocerciasis, periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis or granuloma inguinale wouldn't show the same distinctive parasitic structures and terminal spine on histological examination.

433
B: Extrafacial granuloma faciale.

Explanation: The histopathological findings are very suggestive of granuloma faciale, a rare benign skin disease characterised by single or multiple cutaneous nodules. It usually manifests on the face, hence the term 'faciale', but can sometimes present at extrafacial sites as seems to be the case here. The presence of the grenz zone (a clear area just below the epidermis), characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone, small-vessel vasculitis, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate involving eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils are key histopathologic features of this condition. While Sweet syndrome, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, and leishmaniasis are all conditions that can present with skin nodules, the specific histologic findings and clinical presentation in this case point more towards a diagnosis of extrafacial granuloma faciale.

434
C: Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of a brain abscess, which is commonly seen in cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease with a right-to-left shunt; however, the 2-dimensional echocardiogram did not show any signs of congenital heart disease. The patient's significant finger and toe clubbing, high hematocrit level, and hypoxia, along with the radiographic findings of a nodular shadow in the lung, are suggestive of a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt. These shunts can cause brain abscesses by allowing pathogens to bypass the pulmonary capillary bed, which typically filters them out. Therefore, in this case, a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt is the most appropriate diagnosis considering the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings. Studies have shown an association between digital clubbing and pulmonary arteriovenous shunts in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

C: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms including tendon xanthomas (painless masses on Achilles tendons), neurologic signs (poor memory, personality changes, balance instability, positive ankle clonus and Babinski sign, and positive Chaddock and Romberg signs), and elevated triglyceride level are indicative of Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Additionally, the MRI results showing bilateral and symmetrical abnormal signals at various sites in the brain are consistent with the neurological features of Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Finally, the genetic testing revealing a mutation in CYP27A1 gene confirms this diagnosis, as mutations in this gene are known to cause Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, which is a rare inherited lipid-storage disease.

436
B: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Explanation: The patient has new-onset heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and an abnormal echogenic band across the left ventricular apex, observed in echocardiography. Cardiac MRI is often the next best step in evaluation, as it can help identify the origin of these abnormal findings. It aids in distinguishing between infiltrative cardiomyopathies (e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), noncompaction cardiomyopathy, and other possible structural causes. Given the patient's complex hematologic history and the presence of hypereosinophilia, MRI will be crucial in either confirming or excluding the diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis which is a critical differential diagnosis in this context. Endomyocardial biopsy (Option A) is often definitive but is reserved for when less invasive diagnostic modalities are non-diagnostic or when the patient is deteriorating rapidly. Whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan (Option C) is not necessary at this stage without specific suspicion of a systemic disease like malignancy or vasculitis. Genetic testing for noncompaction (Option D) would not be recommended unless there were more definitive imaging findings supporting that diagnosis.

B: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor

Explanation: The patient's history of a recurrent vocal fold mass, the findings from the pathology report of the fibroblastic-myofibroblastic cells with lymphocytes and plasma cells, and the negative results for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin but positive for ALK1 and vimentin are pathological features of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). IMTs are rare, benign tumors that can recur but seldom metastasize. They characteristically express ALK1, which is not common in the other differential diagnoses provided.
B
438
D: Glial heterotopia. 

Explanation: The characteristics of the mass in the posterior neck of the infant as described such as the presence of cells with oval nuclei and small nucleoli, surrounded by a pale eosinophilic and slightly fibrillary stroma are indicative of Glial heterotopia. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical studies being positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, and focally positive for S100, NeuN, and synaptophysin support this diagnosis. Glial heterotopia, also known as nasal glioma, is a benign, congenital malformation where normal glial tissue is found outside of the neuroaxis with no intracranial connection. The masses are typically firm, non-tender, and non-mobile, consistent with the physical characteristics described in this case.
D
439
B: Cerebral vein thrombosis. 

Explanation: The key clues from the given scenario include isolation of dysphagia and dysphonia following an operatively managed head trauma, right vocal cord paralysis on laryngoscopic examination, and most importantly CT imaging findings suggestive of thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex leading to acute compression of the recurrent nerve. This constellation of symptoms and findings are more consistent with cerebral vein thrombosis which may cause an edema or mass effect resulting in nerve compression. Carotid artery dissection could potentially lead to neurological symptoms but doesn't specifically explain the vocal cord palsy. Posttraumatic central motor impairment would likely manifest with widespread motor deficits rather than an isolated dysphagia and dysphonia, and postoperative laryngeal paralysis is less likely given the location and cause of nerve compression presented.
B
440
C: Kimura disease 

Explanation: The diagnosis is Kimura disease, a rare, benign, chronic inflammatory disorder that is most common in Asian men. Interestingly, this case involved a Hispanic woman. Kimura disease is recognized by its characteristic clinical and pathologic findings, which include painless cervical lymphadenopathy or subcutaneous masses in the head or neck, elevated eosinophil counts and serum IgE, and histologic findings of reactive follicular hyperplasia, prominent eosinophilic infiltration, and fibrosis. The negative results for Gomori methenamine silver and acid-fast stains excluded fungal and mycobacterial infections. Since the patient's lesion was a lymph node and not a branchial cleft cyst, option D was also ruled out. Both Hodgkin lymphoma and mastoiditis are associated with painful masses, which the patient did not report, thereby eliminating options A and B respectively. Furthermore, the lack of systemic symptoms like fever or night sweats and the absence of ear symptoms also rule out mastoiditis and lymphoma. Lastly, Hodgkin lymphoma typically appears with Reed-Sternberg cells, which were not found in this case.
C
441
B: Repeat the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

Explanation: Given the patient’s history of breast cancer treatment, neurologic symptoms, and unusual MRI findings, her neurologic symptoms could be due to a recurrent neoplasm or to treatment effects. High-dose corticosteroids could manifest the conditions but would not address the underlying cause, so alternative A is insufficient. A repeat PET scan (alternative C) could be considered if the patient had systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy suggesting malignancy recurrence, but this patient did not present with such signs. Finally, repeating ACE testing in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (alternative D) is unlikely to provide the needed information since the patient's prior ACE levels were normal and she had a normal chest CT scan. Therefore, repeating the MRI of the brain (alternative B) could better evaluate any changes in the leptomeningeal and cranial nerve enhancements and provide more clues for a differential diagnosis including leptomeningeal metastases, lymphoma, or neurosarcoidosis.

C: Sweep the superior fornix. 

Explanation: Given the chronic nature of this patient's conjunctivitis, previous medical management, and presence of deep superior conjunctival fornices, the next logical step would be to sweep the superior fornix. This would eliminate any potential foreign bodies or concretions that could be contributing to the chronic inflammation and recurrent infections. The method is relatively noninvasive and can be effective in chronic cases of conjunctivitis when other causes have been ruled out.

D

Explanation: The darkly pigmented, sausage-shaped nodule with associated symptoms in the patient implies a possible malignancy. Therefore, a conservative treatment such as hot compresses or antibiotic-steroid ointment might not be sufficient. Option D, performing a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins, is a better choice as it would allow for both immediate treatment and evaluation of the entire lesion to determine the appropriate next steps of management. Incision and drainage or corticosteroid injection could possibly cause further spreading of the potential malignant cells and is not typically the first-line treatment for suspected malignancies.
C: Initiate vitamin C supplementation

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, which include fatigue, weakness, widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and perifollicular purpura, are suggestive of scurvy, a disease resulting from a deficiency in vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Scurvy is rare in developed countries but can still occur in poor or marginalized populations, or in individuals with a restrictive diet. Clinical suspicion should increase for scurvy in patients with diet limitations such as those resulting from psychiatric illness, alcohol use disorder, or food insecurity. Since the patient is nonadherent with medications and being treated for psychiatric conditions, these predisposing factors could contribute to malnutrition or dietary deficiencies, leading to scurvy. The initial treatment for scurvy is oral vitamin C supplementation, hence option C is the suitable choice.

D. Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.

Explanation: The elevated INR of 3.7 in this patient is a sign of over-anticoagulation that can put the patient at increased risk of bleeding. His warfarin dose has been stable for a year and he reports no recent changes or nonadherence that would explain the elevated INR. Therefore, the best initial step is to confirm the POC INR test result with a laboratory plasma INR test, which is considered to be more accurate.
After confirming the INR elevation, appropriate changes to the warfarin dose or frequency can be made if necessary. It is critical to verify the POC test results before initiating any changes, as incorrect dosing decisions could potentially worsen the patient's over-anticoagulation.
A: Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous amiodarone

Explanation: Given the patient's recurrent and treatment-resistant tachycardia, intravenous amiodarone would be a reasonable next step. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that works by blocking multiple cardiac ion channels, thus delaying repolarization and increasing the duration of the action potential. It can be useful in managing various tachyarrhythmias, including those that are unresponsive to other less potent antiarrhythmics, such as adenosine, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers (diltiazem). This, coupled with its relatively low proarrhythmic risk, makes amiodarone a suitable choice in this clinical situation.

B: Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis 

Explanation: The dermoscopic and histopathologic features observed in this case are consistent with a diagnosis of periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis (PXE-PDE). The characteristic clinical presentation includes yellowish coalescent papules around the umbilicus. Dermoscopic findings often reveal accentuation of the normal pigmentary network and curvilinear brown pigment lines, as seen in this patient. Moreover, the histologic analysis, which demonstrated clumped elastic fibers, aligns with the known histopathologic features of PXE-PDE. The other answer options could be excluded due to the absence of their characteristic findings. For example, periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is typically associated with systemic findings, elastosis perforans serpiginosa would show follicular plugging, and late-onset focal dermal elastosis would present with an elderly male patient with a history of significant sun exposure.

D: Cutaneous angiosarcoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation and histological features are highly suggestive of Cutaneous angiosarcoma. It is a rare, aggressive malignancy originating from vascular endothelial cells. It is more common in elderly women and often involves the breast or chest wall. Initial appearance may resemble benign dermatitis or hematoma, as it manifests as a poorly defined, bruise-like, erythematous or violaceous patch. However, it progressively enlarges and becomes nodular with potential for bleeding. The fact that the lesion did not respond to steroid therapy and the presence of large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm confirm the malignancy while the absence of other remarkable findings possibly indicates a cutaneous origin. Angiosarcoma should always be considered when encountering cutaneous lesion with unknown etiology in elderly patients, even when no history of cancer or chronic diseases.

449
C: Chorea-acanthocytosis

Explanation: The patient's age of onset, symptoms, and laboratory findings strongly suggest Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc). ChAc is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. Key features observed in this case are orofacial dyskinesia involving tongue and lip-biting, vocalizations, and a markedly wide-based gait. In addition, acanthocytes were found in the patient's blood smear, which is a common finding in ChAc. Moreover, elevated CK levels and muscle and nerve damage as evidenced by EMG results and reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential of bilateral median and ulnar nerves are common in ChAc. Finally, brain MRI showed marked bilateral caudate head atrophy, which is an important feature of ChAc. The absence of seizures, normal cognitive function (except for mild cognitive decline), and negative autoimmune encephalitis-related antibodies help rule out other similar conditions, such as Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration and Huntington's disease-like 2. Although low levels of LDL and ApoB might suggest Hypobetalipoproteinemia, this condition usually doesn't present with neurodegenerative symptoms and thus seems less likely.

A: Transthoracic echocardiogram

Explanation: Given the suspicious lead placement indicated in the posterior-anterior and lateral projections of the chest radiography, the next best step would be to get a Transthoracic echocardiogram. This will allow for real-time imaging of the heart and would confirm the exact placement of the pacemaker leads. This is essential as malposition of pacemaker leads could be contributing to the recurrent strokes the patient is experiencing. If the lead is indeed in the left ventricle, it may pose a risk for thrombus formation and subsequent embolization, leading to stroke. This could explain the recurrent strokes in this patient despite well-controlled risk factors and absence of atrial fibrillation. The other options, while important in managing stroke, are less relevant in this case given the specific findings on radiography.

451
B: PPV plus pathological examination plus genetic test

Explanation: The patient's systemic conditions, including weight loss and anemia, combined with the unusual vitreous opacity found in both eyes, suggest an underlining pathology possibly related to a genetic disorder. A PPV would allow for analysis of the vitreous opacity, which could provide significant information regarding the etiology of the case. A pathological examination could help identify any anomalies present in the tissues, and a genetic test could elucidate if there's a hereditary factor involved, based on the family history of liver cancer and vision loss due to vitreous hemorrhage and glaucoma. Despite the patient denying any history of systemic disorders, her symptoms, vitreous opacity, weight loss, mild anemia, and family history suggest otherwise. Therefore, further investigation is well indicated.

B: Obtain orbital imaging. 

Explanation: The newly identified orbital mass causing globe deformation requires further evaluation to determine its etiology. Orbital imaging offers useful characterization of the lesion’s extent, composition, and any potential local invasion. Given the presence of a known systemic malignancy, a metastasis could be a likely explanation for a new orbital lesion. Further, lymphoma specifically is a common cause of an orbital mass. Therefore, broadly examining the lesion is a crucial first step before applying a more invasive approach, like biopsy. The other options, such as fluorescein angiography and liver biopsy, could be beneficial in specific circumstances but are not directly relevant to this patient's current main problem. Additionally, simply monitoring the patient has the risk of allowing any underlying serious conditions to progress unnecessarily.

453
C: Refer the patient to a primary care physician for a metastatic workup 

Explanation: In this case, the patient's history of smoking and the presence of a solitary choroidal mass in her right eye without any other systemic symptoms make a primary intraocular malignancy, such as uveal melanoma, a significant concern. Although amelanotic melanoma accounts for a small percentage of uveal melanomas, the aggressive nature of such tumors and the potential for metastasis warrant an urgent workup. A metastatic workup is important to rule out metastatic lesions in the eye from another primary site, as the eye is a common site for metastasis of other primary malignancies. Other options like investigating for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis or starting treatment with steroids are less likely in this scenario due to the absence of systemic symptoms typically associated with these conditions. Radiotherapy or vitrectomy with biopsy would likely be premature without a more definitive diagnosis. The patient would benefit from referral to a primary care physician for a systemic evaluation and a possible referral to an ocular oncologist.

454
B: Subungual squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation: The lesion's atypical squamous cells, along with a lack of environmental factors or extensive medical history, suggest malignancy - which points to a diagnosis of subungual squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the patient's prolonged symptoms and the fact that the distal nail plate had been destroyed further indicate a likelihood of subungual squamous cell carcinoma. Onychomycosis is usually associated with fungus, not atypical squamous cells. Subungual verruca vulgaris is a type of wart, not a malignancy, and it's usually not associated with destruction of the nail plate. Lastly, Subungual exostosis is a bony projection which develops underneath the toenail, it often occurs as a result of trauma or injury to the toe, and there is no mention of trauma in the case study.

D: Test for serum cryoglobulin level.

Explanation: The context here suggests a potential for a cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. This is a small vessel vasculitis associated with cryoglobulinemia, a condition characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins that, by definition, precipitate at cold temperatures and dissolve again on rewarming. The most common underlying disorders are chronic infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and autoimmune diseases; however it can be associated with malignancies such as lymphoma. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rash purpura, joint pain, weakness, and neuropathy. Thus, in the given scenario, it is critical to take a serum cryoglobulin level to confirm the diagnosis or guide treatment decisions. While the symptoms might also suggest infection requiring antibiotics (option A), or protein C deficiency (option B), the clinical features and recent lymphoma progression make cryoglobulinemic vasculitis a highly relevant option. Calcium-phosphate product calculation (option C) is not directly related to the symptoms presented.

456
A: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 

Explanation: The general symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, weight loss without fever or sweating may suggest a systemic condition. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma often presents with pink to purple papules or plaques. It can be distinguished by histopathological examination showing atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes amidst abundant histiocytes. The presence of such lymphocytes along with lack of response to adalimumab and hydroxychloroquine therapy might further support this diagnosis. A lower CD4 signal and robust CD8 signal, as seen in the biopsy results here, are common in this lymphoma, supporting the diagnosis. A granuloma, nodular-histiocytic dermal infiltrate further supports the lymphoma diagnosis. The patient's pulmonary symptoms and joint issues may have been additional systemic manifestations of the lymphoma or secondary complications. Therefore, while initial diagnostic biopsy suggested granuloma annulare, the overall clinical picture is more consistent with Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

457
B: Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma

Explanation: Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia that presents as multiple tiny keratotic papules on the palms and soles, often with a central punctate depression. This mainly congenital or early-onset condition is often associated with autosomal dominant inheritance but sporadic occurrences are also seen. The findings of grouped, circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core localized to the right palm and finger are characteristic of this condition. The absence of a hair shaft in the sampling and the patient’s history, including onset since age 2, unremarkable medical and family history, and failure of previous varied treatments, further supports PPK over other differentials. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus typically presents in infancy with hyperkeratotic papules and plaques along the Blaschko line. Comedonal Darier disease and Nevus comedonicus involve follicular plugging and are not typically palmoplantar.

B: Erdheim-Chester disease

Explanation: The patient's neurological symptoms, brain MRI findings of a brainstem lesion and bilateral optic nerve enhancement, and body CT findings of soft tissue infiltration in the pericardium, intra-atrial septum, and throughout the retroperitoneum are characteristic of Erdheim-Chester disease. This is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by xanthogranulomatous infiltration of tissues with foamy histiocytes. The disease typically affects multiple organ systems, and neurological involvement can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the areas of the brain affected. Other options are less likely due to the multi-systemic involvement and specific imaging findings. Sarcoidosis typically presents with hilar lymphadenopathy, which is not reported here. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma would be more rapidly progressive and is less likely to cause the specific brain and systemic findings seen here. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody typically presents more acutely with a monophasic course, not chronic and progressive as in this case.

B: Discontinue metoprolol tartrate and repeat the ambulatory ECG.

Explanation: The case presents a man with newly diagnosed high-grade AVB as manifested by ventricular pauses up to 13 seconds. This condition indicates discontinuation of potentially causative or exacerbating medications such as beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and then repeat ambulatory ECG. Metoprolol tartrate, a beta-blocker, could have contributed to or caused this patient's high-grade AVB. While it might be tempting to immediately implant a permanent pacemaker for symptomatic high-grade AVB, it is important to first identify reversible factors. If the high-grade AVB resolves after discontinuation of the drug, a pacemaker may not be necessary. If the AVB persists, then a permanent pacemaker, as suggested in option A, would be the next step. Administering oral theophylline (option C) might be used to increase the heart rate in sinus node dysfunction and is less likely to be helpful in this case. Switching ticagrelor to clopidogrel (option D) is not an ideal solution either because neither medication is associated with AVB.

C: Ectopic thymus 

Explanation: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (also known as DiGeorge syndrome) is often associated with thymic aplasia or hypoplasia leading to T-cell immunodeficiency. On rare occasions, ectopic thymic tissue can be present. The MRI findings, such as the mass exhibiting the same signal characteristics as the muscle on T1 and T2, are consistent with ectopic thymus. It's also important to note that the patient had no thymus in the mediastinum, which could suggest displacement. The presence of squamous cells in the biopsy can be explained by  thymic tissue histology, which includes a mix of lymphoid tissue and epithelial (squamous) cells. Therefore, all the aforementioned characteristics align with a diagnosis of ectopic thymus.
C
461
B: Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including bilateral retinal detachments, vitreous cell, and choroidal thickening, point to an inflammatory etiology. Given the recent systemic symptoms of fevers, chills, and coughing, an infectious or systemic inflammatory cause may be suspected. Option B includes tests for tuberculosis and syphilis, two infectious causes of uveitis that can present with retinal detachments. Additionally, chest radiography may reveal evidence of sarcoidosis, another potential cause of uveitis and retinal detachments. The other options (intravitreal triamcinolone, human leukocyte antigen genotyping, and pars plana vitrectomy with chorioretinal biopsy) may be reasonable steps in the diagnostic or therapeutic process, but they are not the immediate next steps based on the patient's presentation and findings. Therefore, initial systemic evaluation with infectious and inflammatory workup, as in option B, would be most appropriate.

462
D. 

Explanation:

The symptoms mentioned indicate that the boy is likely suffering from Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe hypersensitivity reaction, commonly due to medications, that affects the skin and mucous membranes. This is suggested by the mucocutaneous presentation, bilateral conjunctival involvement, history of drug allergies, and current use of two antibiotics associated with SJS. Moreover, the exclusion of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae related rash and mucositis, another differential diagnosis, by normal IgG and IgM titers further supports this. 

Discontinuing all possible causative drugs is the first and the most critical step in the management of SJS. This includes stopping both ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in this case. The other options, such as initiating a course of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids or recommending systemic corticosteroids or performing an amniotic membrane transplantation, may be needed at later stages for specific complications or persistent symptoms, but they are not the first intervention in dealing with this condition.
C: Obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history. 

Explanation: In commenting on the next step for management, it is important to understand the patient thoroughly by obtaining a complete medical and personal history, specifically any potential drug use that can impact retinal health. Drugs such as tamoxifen and chloroquine, for instance, are known to be toxic to the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. The history may also reveal other potential causes such as genetic retinal diseases. While laboratory testing can be useful, it is not the first step given the absence of signs of inflammation. Likewise, dye angiography might not be necessary at this stage as OCT scanning has already given a good view of the macular area. The visible defect in the OCT image should be correlated with the patient's symptoms. Antiviral drugs would be premature without clear evidence of a viral etiology. Therefore, option C is the most fitting as the information gathered can guide subsequent management.

A: Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor, followed by chemotherapy for the eye

Explanation: The presentation and imaging findings of the 18-month-old girl are consistent with retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina that typically occurs in children. Given the child's age and the specific findings such as leukocoria, this clinical situation is highly suspicious for retinoblastoma. The management of retinoblastoma involves imaging to determine the extent of disease, especially regarding potential optic nerve and brain invasion, which can have implications for staging and management. If retinoblastoma is confirmed, treatment typically includes chemotherapy. Early detection and treatment are crucial because retinoblastoma can spread to the brain and other parts of the body. The other listed options do not offer immediate intervention necessary for this potentially life-threatening condition.

C: Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. 

Explanation: The progressive development of joint deformities only after starting nivolumab, along with the absence of systemic symptoms, seronegativity, and failure of regular treatment, strongly suggests Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is associated with immune-related adverse events including inflammatory arthritis. The patient’s arthritis didn't respond to common treatments and she showed a partial response to steroids, suggesting possible immune mediation. The absence of symptoms prior to beginning Nivolumab treatment also points to a drug-induced case.

B: Order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay

Explanation: The patient's chronic joint pain and stiffness, conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, lack of inflammation on examination and elevated protein and albumin in the urine may indicate the presence of amyloidosis, a disease characterized by deposition of amyloid proteins in organs and tissues. Amyloidosis can present with musculoskeletal symptoms, including carpal tunnel syndrome and destructive arthropathy. The presence of large soft tissue masses further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, it is advised to order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay, which are useful for identifying monoclonal protein that suggest plasma cell disorders including amyloidosis. Bone scan, methotrexate therapy and temporal artery biopsy are not first-line diagnostic or management options in this scenario.

C: Perform a laboratory-based HbA1c test to determine the patient’s glycemic status.

Explanation: Given the patient’s obesity and high blood pressure, he is at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Although the patient doesn't have symptoms indicative of hyperglycemia, considering his risk factors, testing is warranted. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends HbA1c testing as it provides a measure of average blood glucose over the past 3 months, reducing the chance of day-to-day glucose variability affecting testing. Therefore, a laboratory-based HbA1c test is a good strategy for determining glycemic status in this patient.
However, while a POC HbA1c test does provide immediate results, it may not be as accurate as the laboratory-based version. In a patient without obvious symptoms of diabetes, the accuracy of the diagnostic test is important to prevent overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis.

B: Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides

Explanation: This diagnosis is based on the 12-year history of itchy eruptions over the whole body, the gradual increase of nodules on the back, and the physical examination findings of extensive, dry scaly patches on the body, and dome-shaped red papules and nodules observed on the upper back. His lymph nodes were mildly enlarged in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. However, routine blood tests and biochemistry analyses were within normal limits, no atypical cells were found in the peripheral blood, and the biopsy specimen showed small to medium-sized atypical cells, and focal areas of epidermotropism. Mycosis fungoides is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma which primarily affects the skin and can present in multiple forms, including the icthyosiform form. It is also supported by the lack of family history of inherited ichthyosis or atopy, further excluding options A, C, & D. The histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis also suggest it as they show features consistent with mycosis fungoides.

B: Annular atrophic lichen planus

Explanation: The slightly erythematous annular atrophic plaques with raised rims and slight white scale, combined with a depressed and wrinkled appearance in the center are indicative of annular atrophic lichen planus. Erythema annulare centrifugum typically presents as annular, erythematous rings that expand centrifugally leaving a clear center, which is not seen in this case. Porokeratosis often demonstrates a distinctive raised border with atypical keratinocytes, and granuloma annulare commonly presents as skin-colored or reddish bumps and plaques rather than the slightly erythematous atrophic plaques seen in this case. Thus, lichen planus is the most reasonable diagnosis.

470
B: Toxic myelopathy. 

Explanation: Given the patient's history, clinical presentation, and investigation results, a diagnosis of toxic myelopathy, specifically associated with nitrous oxide abuse, may be considered. The patient has a progressive complete myelitis pattern, with a long segment, centrally located lesion without preferential dorsal or lateral column involvement, which is classical for nitrous oxide toxicity. Although other conditions such as postinfectious myelopathy, glioma, and spinal dural arteriovenous fistula can cause similar symptoms, they are less likely in this case as they are usually associated with infectious, neoplastic, or vascular abnormalities which were ruled out through comprehensive infectious, oncologic, and inflammatory workup. The patient also denied any medication or recreational drug use, which would have suggested a different etiology. Nitrous oxide abuse can lead to myelopathy due to vitamin B12 inactivation, leading to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. However, serum B12 level may remain normal, as in this case. The benign findings in the cerebrospinal fluid also support a diagnosis of toxic cause over infectious or immune-mediated one. Nitrous oxide is readily available in whipped cream chargers, making it a potential silent menace in nutraceutical abuse. Finally, suspicion of nutraceutical abuse is actionable, potentially arresting further deterioration and even possibly reversing disability in case of nitrous oxide toxicity. Therefore, a diagnosis of toxic myelopathy is most consistent with the clinical picture.

B: Right and left heart catheterization.

Explanation: The man's symptoms, enlarged, pulsatile liver, abnormal ECG findings, and the auscultatory findings suggest a cardiovascular problem. The right and left heart catheterization, which measures pressures in the heart and pulmonary arteries and examines the heart's structures and function, would be useful in providing a definitive diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography (Option A) may not be necessary based on current findings and evidence. Option C, Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, may not provide additional information beyond that which can be obtained via echocardiography. Liver biopsy (Option D) could be potentially dangerous and is not indicated without a clearer suggestion of liver disease.

A: Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass. 

Explanation: This patient's physical examination and imaging findings are concerning for malignancy. Although breast cancer is rare in men, risk is increased in African American men compared with white men. Most male breast cancers are diagnosed at an older age, but obesity is also a risk factor and may have contributed to this relatively young patient's presentation. Clinical features suggestive of malignancy include painless breast mass, nipple retraction, or nipple discharge. On imaging, breast malignancies often appear as irregular masses with indistinct margins, as seen in this patient. Therefore, the next best step is a percutaneous biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The cell type, receptor status (eg, estrogen/progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and grade of the cancer can be determined from the biopsy sample, which will then guide the subsequent management and provide prognostic information. If cancer is confirmed, genetic testing for BRCA mutation is indicated in any man with breast cancer due to its association with high-grade prostate cancer and male breast, pancreatic, and other cancers in his relatives.

D: Stevens-Johnson syndrome. 

Explanation: Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It's often a reaction to a medication or an infection. In this case, the patient's symptoms such as desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, and hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera are indicative of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Furthermore, the generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa further support this diagnosis. Although the other options can present with desquamatory lesions too, the severity and specific locations of the lesions along with the recurrent nature of the condition in the patient's medical history point towards Stevens-Johnson syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.
C
474
C: Papillary adenocarcinoma

Explanation: The results described indicate the presence of a pedunculated polypoid lesion in the nasopharynx with the tumor cells arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and also have nuclear grooves. These features are consistent with the histopathological characteristics of a Papillary adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer that can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasopharynx. Furthermore, the successful treatment of the mass with resection and the lack of metastasis as indicated by the post-surgical investigations underscore this diagnosis. Other options like Squamous cell carcinoma, Lymphoma, and Chondrosarcoma did not match with the histopathological features displayed in this case.
C
475
C: Pemphigus vulgaris

Explanation: Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies (IgG) against desmoglein 1 and 3, which are responsible for cell attachment in the skin and mucous membranes. This condition often presents with oral mucosal lesions that precede skin involvement. The serological testing from the patient revealed elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 and 3 IgG, which is consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the deposition of autoantibodies in a lacelike pattern in the intracellular matrix of the stratified squamous epithelium seen in the biopsy of the skin lesion is a characteristic feature of Pemphigus vulgaris. This condition is not correlated with a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test which might be due to latent or active tuberculosis infection, as it is an autoimmune condition. Hence, Pemphigus vulgaris is the accurate diagnosis for this case.
C
476
C: Eosinophilic sialodochitis

Explanation: The case presents with recurring salivary gland swelling and pain with a solitary mucus cast found in the Wharton duct. The cast is composed of eosinophils, indicating an allergic or eosinophilic reaction. Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a benign condition characterized by recurrent salivary gland swelling due to eosinophilic inflammation of the salivary ducts. This condition is typically treated with saline rinses, steroids, and avoidance of potential allergens. Unlike IgG4-related sialadenitis and Kimura disease which usually present with systemic symptoms, eosinophilic sialodochitis is typically a localized disease. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia typically presents with skin nodules, particularly in the head and neck region, which are not mentioned in the case.

D. Given the patient's symptomatology, physical exam and the fact that the corneal scrapings along with the donor rim culture were negative, this could suggest that the origins of the issue are not microbiological. This is further supported by the fact that her symptoms did not improve after commencing on topical antibiotics. The graft-host interface haze and lack of microbiological evidence could suggest graft rejection or interface keratitis. Accordingly, removing and culturing the DSAEK graft could potentially provide a definitive answer as to the nature of the problem, implying that option D may be the most appropriate course of action. Also, by performing this procedure urgently it could potentially halt further damage to the patient's eye.

C: Interferon-γ release assay

Explanation: The patient's gradual vision loss, coupled with his occupation as a farmer and his living in Mexico (both risk factors for tuberculosis [TB]) along with his chronic cough (a symptom associated with pulmonary TB), and the discovery of multifocal choroidal lesions could suggest intraocular TB. Given these findings, the next step should be to test him for latent or active TB theoretically. The interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is a blood test that helps diagnose tuberculosis by detecting the immune system's reaction to TB bacteria. IGRA has the advantage over the traditional tuberculin skin test by being able to provide quicker results and has fewer false-positives due to BCG vaccination. It is important that ocular TB be considered in patients with risk factors, even in ones without a history of systemic TB as ocular TB can occur in the absence of overt systemic disease.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging to investigate for masses

Explanation: The young man's blurred vision and elevated intraocular pressure suggest ocular hypertension or glaucoma, but the absence of angle structures in a gonioscopic examination and the shallow choroidal effusion on ultrasound imaging may also suggest a mass or fluid accumulation pressing on the eye. While choices A, C, and D may be justifiable in certain situations, choice B is the next step to rule out any intraorbital and intracranial pathology or masses which could be the cause of his visual problems, taking into consideration that sudden onset of blurred vision and the discovery of anterior uveal effusion on ultrasound biomicroscopy, which may pose a suspicion of secondary glaucoma due to ciliary body ciliochoroidal effusion. Such secondary causes need further investigation before any surgical intervention is considered (A or C). Also, patient education and observation (D) won't be sufficient in this case given the acute onset and potential underlying causes for this condition.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits

Explanation: Given the unilateral proptosis, mild ocular motility restriction, and undulating posterior pole abnormality in the patient's left eye, a mass effect is highly suspected to be impacting the eye from behind. While applanation tonometry (A) may be helpful to rule out intraocular pressure changes and serum thyroid testing (B) could help rule out thyroid eye disease, they may not detect the presence of an intraorbital mass. Moreover, the patient's prescription changes and tearing could be as a result of a lesion in the orbit distorting the globe. Computed angiography of the head (D) would be beneficial for vascular lesions but may not provide the necessary details for a mass evaluation. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits (C) will provide the best localized and detailed imaging for the assessment of a suspected intraorbital mass.

Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of voluntary muscles, often those that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, swallowing, and speaking. The patient's features of diplopia (double vision), ptosis (drooping eyelid), and modest restriction of ocular motility are typical of MG. This is further supported by presence of elevated acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels, which are typically seen in MG. Myositis refers to any condition involving muscle inflammation. In this case, the patient’s myalgia, elevated creatine kinase and aldolase, and abnormal electromyographic findings suggest he also has myositis. These conditions, both immune-mediated, could be caused or exacerbated by the checkpoint inhibitor therapy (nivolumab), which work by blocking protein interactions that downregulate the immune response, resulting in immune activation against tumors but also sometimes against normal tissues, leading to immune-related adverse events including autoimmune conditions like MG and myositis.

C: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits.

Explanation: Given the rapid vision loss, the absence of ocular inflammation, and the presence of choroidal lesions, the likely cause could be metastatic infiltration. This needs to be investigated to confirm the diagnosis as well as evaluate the extent of the metastasis. An MRI of the head and orbits would be appropriate in this instance to visualize any lesions in these regions.
Option B, injecting anti-VEGF into both eyes, might be considered if neovascularization was found, which it wasn't in this instance. Similarly, high-dose corticosteroids (Option A) might be used if an inflammatory or autoimmune process was suspected, which is not the case here. Option D, stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab, would not be advisable without evidence suggesting these medications are directly resulting in the patient's visual loss.

B: This patient has B12 deficiency. 

Explanation:
The patient has been experiencing fatigue, hair loss, loss of appetite, irregular menstrual periods, and paresthesias, all of which are common symptoms of B12 deficiency. This is further supported by her history of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which can result in B12 deficiency due to malabsorption. She also has decreased daily protein intake, and vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, meaning she is likely not getting enough through her diet. Additionally, her drinking habits can further impair absorption of this vitamin. The physical exam findings of bilateral flattening of the temporalis muscle and thenar eminence might be indicative of general malnourishment or specific nutrient deficiencies, including B12. Although the patient might also have other nutrient deficiencies, the information given primarily supports a diagnosis of B12 deficiency.

D: Cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from rectal carcinoma.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of rectal carcinoma and recent treatments, and the appearance and location of the skin eruption, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from the rectal carcinoma. Cutaneous metastatic carcinoma often presents as indurated nodules or plaques and can occur anywhere on the body, but the vulva is a common site in women. Mucinous adenocarcinoma can also metastasize from the rectum to the skin, making this a more likely diagnosis than the other options. While the other conditions can cause similar presentations, they are less likely given the patient's specific history and presentation.

D: Fibrous cephalic plaque. 

Explanation: The firm plaque on the occipital scalp accompanied by the multiple papules, along with the biopsy findings of diffuse dense fibrosis, capillary vessel proliferation with some ectasia, and perifollicular fibroblastic proliferation, are characteristic of a fibrous cephalic plaque. This condition is a specific form of neurofibroma - a benign nerve sheath tumor. However, its location and presentation differ from the usual neurofibromas. The condition often occurs in people with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder with a wide range of skin manifestations. However, the absence of systemic symptoms or mental impairment in this patient suggests a more sporadic occurrence.

486
C: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atrophic variant. 

Explanation: The clinical and histopathological findings are indicative of the atrophic variant of Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a rare, low-grade skin sarcoma characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells in a storiform pattern. The atrophic variant, seen here, is characterized by an indurated plaque that is atrophic or depressed in the center. The involvement of the chest, back, and limbs, along with the description of these lesions as "smooth-surfaced, skin-colored to hyperpigmented, 0.5- to 1.5-cm atrophic papules and plaques that exhibited the buttonhole sign on palpation" supports the diagnosis. DFSP tumors also often have a characteristic histopathology, as seen here, with proliferation of spindle cells with mildly hyperchromatic, elongated, wavy nuclei surrounded by pale cytoplasm. Mitotic figures and nuclear pleomorphism are uncommon in DFSP which matches the case presentation. In contrast, neurofibroma and anetoderma usually have distinct clinical and histopathological features. Medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is a benign lesion characterized by its unique clinical and histological appearance, different from the current case.

C: Rippling muscle disease. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of muscle twitching, visible undulating movements on the muscle surface, mild weakness, and excessive sweating suggest rippling muscle disease. This diagnosis is supported by the absence of symptoms such as confusion, memory problems, hallucinations, and sleep disturbance, which can be associated with other conditions like Morvan syndrome and autoimmune Isaacs syndrome. Furthermore, normal laboratory test and chest CT results also rule out amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various autoimmune or paraneoplastic conditions. The association between rippling muscle disease and psoriasis is still an object of medical research, but it's worth noting that both conditions can cause skin lesions.

A: Start corticosteroid therapy. 

Explanation: The choice to start corticosteroid therapy is based on the patient's complex and refractory VA and history of bronchial asthma and nasal polyps. This medical profile suggests a possible underlying systemic inflammatory condition, such as Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), which involves the coronary arteries and can cause refractory angina. Steroid therapy has been reported to bring symptomatic relief in such conditions. Reprogramming the ICD may not necessarily prevent recurrences of VA episodes, while surgical and percutaneous revascularizations may not be effective in managing the dynamic coronary vessel spasm in VA. Therefore, starting corticosteroid therapy presents the best potential treatment for the patient.

489
B: Chordoma 

Explanation: The key findings in this case are the cross-imaging appearance of the lesion, the transosseous growth pattern, the location within the clivus and extending into the sphenoid sinus, and the characteristic “soap-bubble” histopathology with myxoid background. These findings are highly suggestive of a chordoma. Chordomas are rare, malignant bone tumors that originate from notochordal remnants. They typically affect the axial skeleton, most commonly at the clivus and sacrococcygeal region. On imaging, chordomas often show a characteristic lobulated appearance, a pattern of bone destruction, and infiltration of surrounding structures. Histopathologically, they show physaliphorous (bubble-bearing) cells within a myxoid stroma, often described as having a “soap-bubble-like” appearance. Options A, C, and D are less likely considering the imaging findings and the histopathology.
B
490
C: NUT carcinoma

Explanation: NUT carcinoma (NC) is considered the correct diagnosis due to several factors presented within this case. Primarily, the pathology report of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma which is positive for p63 and cytokeratin 5/6, with focal areas of abrupt squamous differentiation and keratinization. In addition, the extensive bone erosion and widespread involvement of surgical margins seen on microscopic examination are also consistent with NC. While NC is rare, it is highly aggressive and can present with local invasiveness and early distant metastasis, reflecting the involvement of the periorbita and the orbit mentioned in the case, as well as the residual tumor visible at the follow-up examination. Lastly, Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin were negative which helps to exclude some other entities like lymphomas, NPC, olfactory neuroblastoma.
C
491
B

Explanation: X-linked deafness 2 is caused by mutations in the POU3F4 gene, as is the case with this patient. This genetic form of deafness is characterized by progressive hearing loss, often beginning in late childhood or early adolescence. The CT scan findings of enlarged vestibular aqueducts, fistulous communication between IAC and the cochlea, and bulbous dilation of the IAC are also consistent with X-linked deafness 2. Furthermore, the patient's family history of childhood-onset hearing loss contributes to this diagnosis, as this condition is inherited. Although the patient has no apparent renal or ophthalmologic abnormalities often associated with some other types of genetic hearing loss such as Branchio-oto-renal syndrome or Usher syndrome, these conditions could be ruled out given the presence of POU3F4 gene mutation and the specific alterations noted in the temporal bone CT scan. Similarly, Pendred syndrome usually presents with goiter, which the patient does not exhibit. Hence, the most fitting diagnosis would be X-linked deafness 2.
D: Obtain biopsy results.
Explanation: 
The patient's presentation of bilateral intraconal orbital masses encasing the optic nerves, along with the history of solitary hypothalamic-pituitary axis thickening, and improvement in the pituitary abnormality without treatment are indeterminate and could be due to a variety of causes, such as lymphoma, inflammation, infection, metastasis or sarcoidosis. Thus, histopathologic examination is necessary to determine the cause and guide further management. While thyroid eye disease could present with bilateral infiltrates, it's usually extraconal and associated with a history of thyroid disease. Graves ophthalmopathy typically demonstrates muscle involvement rather than nerve. A Doppler ultrasonography would not be helpful for diagnosis in this case. Chest computed tomography might be relevant if there was suspicion of lung cancer or sarcoidosis, however, the presentation and patient's history do not directly indicate these conditions.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation. 

Explanation: The child's case involves a relatively rare ocular lesion that is not necessarily suggestive of a typical viral or inflammatory process, hence the options of antivirals or corticosteroids could not be the most relevant. Instead, the pathology seems localized to one eye without signs of systemic involvement. It is therefore critical to further investigate the origin of the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide critical insights into potential brain involvement or other neurological associations. A genetic evaluation might also be beneficial because some rare ocular disorders are genetic in nature. Though measures like plaque brachytherapy or enucleation may be necessary in the future, it is premature to contemplate such drastic treatments before conducting a more in-depth study of the condition.

494
D: Immunosuppressive therapy. 

Explanation: Given the findings of left retinal detachment with macular involvement and without visible retinal tears, along with the choroidal detachment, we may suspect uveal effusion syndrome (UES). UES, although rare, is typically associated with nanophthalmic or otherwise normal-sized eyes. It's characterized by choroidal and ciliochoroidal effusions leading to serous retinal detachments. The prednisone and triamcinolone acetonide treatments tried on the patient appear ineffective as the conditions worsens. That leads to the consideration of immunosuppressive therapy, which may prove beneficial in managing inflammation and reducing fluid accumulation in the subretinal space. The other surgical options may not address the suspected underlying inflammatory nature of this patient's condition adequately. Hence, immunosuppressive therapy is a valid next step in managing this case.

C: Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation.

Explanation: This patient exhibits severe symptoms of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), including substantial capillary nonperfusion and extensive disc neovascularization. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are recommended to target VEGF, a key contributor to both neovascularization and macular edema in diabetic retinopathy. Laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is also needed to involution of new vessels which are present in the optic disc, reducing the risk of vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment, common complications of PDR. A combination of both treatments (option C) can address both the padlock of new vessels and the macular thickening related to diabetic macular edema. The measures also aim to stabilize vision and reduce the risk of further vision loss. This combination is a preferred treatment strategy following guidelines for managing PDR with coexistent diabetic macular edema.

496
B: Systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy.
Explanation: The patient's issue seems to be inflammation leading to macular edema, possibly due to the trauma associated with the car accident. Systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy would help to reduce this inflammation and subsequently alleviate the edema. Option C is not a primary choice since it only addresses the epiretinal membrane in the left eye, while the problem is bilateral. Options A and D are not immediate solutions for the edema. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (Option D) is typically used for neovascular disorders, not for trauma-induced edemas. And simply observing (Option A) might lead to permanent loss of vision. Therefore, in this case, corticosteroid therapy seems the most suitable immediate intervention to manage the bilateral macular edema.

497
C: Merkel cell carcinoma

Explanation: The primary factors pointing towards the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) are the patient's age, the rapid growth of the lesion, the present of lymphadenopathy, and the nodular, violaceous appearance of the lesion. MCC is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that usually appears as a painless, firm, shiny lump on the sun-exposed skin. It frequently metastasizes to the regional lymph nodes, as seen in this patient. In contrast to MCC, cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer would likely present with systemic symptoms indicative of lung involvement, which are absent in this patient. Loxoscelism, a condition caused by the bite of a brown recluse spider, is usually self-limiting and does not lead to lymphadenopathy. Finally, Sézary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, often presents with exfoliative erythroderma, pruritus, and lymphadenopathy, symptoms not seen in this case.

Sorry, as an AI, I currently don't have the capability to review the ECG as it requires visual evaluation. I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for accurate interpretation and diagnosis.
B: Assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype

Explanation: This patient's symptoms of chronic productive cough, dyspnea, and lower-lobe predominant emphysema with bronchiectasis on imaging are suggestive of α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). AATD is an autosomal co-dominant condition characterized by low serum levels of α1-antitrypsin, leading to unopposed neutrophil elastase activity that destructs the alveolar walls, causing emphysema. Patients often present in their late 30s to early 40s (as seen in this case), a relatively young age for the degree of lung disease seen, especially in nonsmokers or light smokers. Furthermore, the panacinar emphysema seen in AATD often predominantly involves the lower lobes, distinguishing it from the centrilobular emphysema of smoking, which usually involves the upper lobes. Thus, a serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype should be assessed next to confirm the diagnosis.

A: Mycosis fungoides

Explanation: Mycosis fungoides, a subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, typically presents like this, as poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques common on the trunk and proximal extremities. The lesions may be mildly pruritic and slowly progressive. Clinical differential diagnoses include large-plaque parapsoriasis and cutaneous amyloidosis but the presence of atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei in the epidermis, as seen on the biopsy, is most suggestive of Mycosis Fungoides. The lack of dystrophic follicular plugging and absent lichenoid interface dermatitis, rules out Dowling-Degos disease and cutaneous amyloidosis respectively. Further, the immunohistochemical features with atypical lymphocytes expressing CD3+/CD4+/CD7−/CD8− phenotype support the diagnosis. The absence of palpable lymphadenopathy doesn't exclude the diagnosis. The presentation of mycosis fungoides can be patch, plaque, or tumor stage, with the most common developed from patch to thicker plaques and eventually to tumors.

D: Intralymphatic histiocytosis.

Explanation: The presence of a dermal infiltrate composed mostly of histiocytes, as revealed by Immunohistochemical staining for CD68 antigen, is consistent with histiocytosis. The specific pattern of the skin lesion, which includes a rusty-brown, atrophic, and streaklike plaque extending from the shoulder to the biceps, with the presence of an arborizing purple plaque, is suggestive of the particular subtype of intralymphatic histiocytosis. This condition is often associated with orthopedic hardware or orthopedic surgery, as is the case with this patient who had a right total reverse shoulder replacement 5 years prior.

B: Diffuse melanosis cutis. 

Explanation: The clinical feature of hyperpigmentation, along with the histopathological findings of S100, HMB-45 and MART-1 positive cells in the lymph node suggests the diagnosis of diffuse melanosis cutis. This condition is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with metastatic melanoma and is characterized by dark, gray to black hyperpigmentation of the skin, nails and mucosa. The other suggested diagnoses such as hemochromatosis and Addison disease also cause hyperpigmentation, but other clinical findings and biochemical parameters do not support these diagnoses. Sun exposure related hyperpigmentation usually does not cause diffuse pigmentation. The patient's disease progression and response to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy used for treating metastatic melanoma, further supports this diagnosis.

B: Subcutaneous ICD reprogramming and observation.

Explanation: The woman's events recorded by subcutaneous ICD and the absence of other symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope imply that there may be a suboptimal programming of the device rather than a clinical worsening of her condition. This should be addressed by reprogramming and closely monitoring her status. While options A, C, and D may be relevant in cases with different clinical pictures, they are not specifically suited to this case. Increasing dosage of β-blocker or administering anticoagulation without clear evidence of arrhythmia or thromboembolic event is not appropriate. Similarly, while catheter ablation or using antiarrhythmic drugs can be effective for managing arrhythmias, there is no immediate evidence in this case to suggest a need for these invasive or pharmacological interventions. Therefore, the appropriate steps are reevaluating and reprogramming the ICD and closely observing the patient's response.

B: Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction

Explanation: 
Schwannoma is a benign tumor derived from Schwann cells, which produce the protective myelin sheath that covers peripheral nerves. These tumors can occur anywhere in the body where there are peripheral nerves, including the tongue. They are typically asymptomatic and slow-growing but can cause pain, and in this case, significant swelling and oral dysphagia.

The woman's history of a mass that developed after initial bite trauma along with severe pain and occasional swelling indicates a reactive process. Additionally, the lesion's rapid increase in size over 3 weeks suggests an active inflammatory process. This clinical picture fits with a diagnosis of traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia, which is a reactive inflammatory response usually caused by repeated trauma.

The immunohistochemistry report of SOX-10 positive staining also confirmed the population of Schwann cells, which are the origin cells of schwannomas. Hence, the diagnosis of Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction (B) is the most consistent option. This diagnosis fits with the clinical history, examination, and immunohistochemistry findings.
B
505
A: Tuberculosis of the palate 

Explanation: The patient's history of HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis, along with the picture of necrotizing lymph nodes and the biopsy, suggest advanced tuberculosis. The fact that the patient had completed a liver-sparing regimen recently because of toxic effects from a first-line regimen, and that his CD4 count remained low even with the treatment, indicate his immune system was probably not fully effective in controlling the TB infection. Additionally, tuberculosis can infect any organ and tissue. In this case, the hard palate was affected, leading to its perforation. The other options like Tertiary Syphilis, Histoplasmosis, or Sarcoidosis are less likely due to the absence of characteristic signs or a supportive clinical context.
C
506
B: Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser. 

Explanation: The patient is exhibiting signs of capsular bag distention syndrome (CBDS), which typically happens several years after cataract surgery due to accumulation of opalescent fluid within the capsular bag. This causes an apparent myopic shift. The preferred treatment for CBDS is Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. This procedure helps create a passage for the fluid to drain, thus returning the IOL to its original location and reducing the myopic shift. Option A may not be necessary as the other symptoms do not indicate severe complications, while Option C can be too invasive. Option D may only worsen the condition by causing further distention. Therefore, the best course of action in this case is Option B.

D: Perform superficial corneal biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of medication deposition, considering her systemic intake of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for Sjögren syndrome. A direct cause-and-effect relationship between hydroxychloroquine sulfate and corneal opacification remains incompletely elucidated. However, excluding other causes of corneal opacification via a superficial corneal biopsy helps establish a definitive diagnosis. Given the irregular appearance and subepithelial location, an infectious or inflammatory etiology, which might warrant oral acyclovir sodium or topical cyclosporine, respectively, is less likely. Penetrating keratoplasty, a surgical procedure, is generally considered when other therapeutic options have failed or when the level of visual impairment necessitates the procedure. In this case, less invasive diagnostic step should be considered first.

B: Surgical resection. 

Explanation: The increase in size of the iris cyst that led to worsening photophobia and decrease in visual acuity indicates that the cyst has become symptomatic and now directly affects the patient's vision. Continued monitoring (C) would not be appropriate due to the symptom progression and noted growth. Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection (A) could be considered, but there is risk of recurrence and potential complications like alcohol leakage. Laser cystotomy (D) could rupture and possibly damage the anterior chamber. Therefore, surgical resection (B) would be the most direct method to remove the lesion completely and prevent any further vision damage.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits

Explanation: Given that the 2 masses  - temporal and the inferiorly subluxed one - are similar in size, shape, and density and separate from the wall of the eye, further imaging would be beneficial for a broader view of the eye and brain imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional information regarding the nature of these masses in context of the whole orbital structure and help in delineating their relationship with surrounding structures. This will also help rule out any possible intracranial pathology and give a thorough evaluation of the entire ocular region.

510
B: Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder

Explanation: From the information provided, the woman is immunocompromised as a result of her kidney transplant and the immunosuppressive therapy. This makes her susceptible to opportunistic infections, neoplasms, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The computed tomography (CT) brain scan shows multifocal vasogenic edema and multiple ring-enhancing lesions which are more consistent with lymphoma than toxoplasmosis, glioblastoma, or a metastasis. The elevated LDH levels and the detection of lymphocytes in her cerebral fluid all point towards a lymphoproliferative disorder. CD20 is a marker for B-cells, which suggests a B-cell lymphoproliferative process and thus supports the diagnosis of primary CNS PTLD. While the other choices may present with similar neurological deficiencies and may be possible in immunocompromised patients, they do not fit with the laboratory, cerebrospinal fluid, and imaging findings as well as primary CNS posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

C: Prescribe oral azithromycin. 

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation of oral and genital ulcerations accompanied by nonproductive cough and fever is consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae–induced rash and mucositis (MIRM). M. pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (often mild or asymptomatic in young adults), but can result in extrapulmonary manifestations such as mucositis. In MIRM, the immune response to M. pneumoniae causes extensive mucosal ulceration. MIRM can often be diagnosed based on clinical criteria, as in this case, where the patient had a positive M. pneumoniae IgM indicating recent or current infection. The appropriate management is supportive care to maintain adequate oral intake and pain control. Patients may benefit from macrolides (such as azithromycin), although the data are limited and primarily anecdotal. Macrolides are usually well-tolerated, and their benefit in reducing the duration and extent of disease, along with having few adverse effects, supports their use in severe cases of mucosal disease due to M. pneumoniae.

C: Perform detailed review of systemic and topical medications.

Explanation: The patient's most noticeable symptom is anisocoria which is more pronounced in bright lighting. This, along with the finding of a unilaterally dilated, poorly reactive pupil and absence of other neurologic symptoms or signs, points towards pharmacologically-induced mydriasis. Therefore, a detailed review of systemic and topical medications is an appropriate first step. It is essential to identify whether the patient has been exposed to pharmacological agents that can cause pupillary dilation. These facts eliminate the need for an immediate Cranial Nerve III palsy-related diagnosis (choices A and B). Also, the normal cranial nerve functions do not support Horner syndrome (choice D). Therefore, a review of systemic and topical medications (choice C) should be prioritized.

513
B: Stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy.

Explanation: The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings suggest the possibility of tuberculous pericarditis. The presence of a high adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in the pericardial fluid strongly supports a diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis. ADA is an enzyme that is involved in purine metabolism and is produced by monocytes and T-lymphocytes. Its activity is highest in diseases associated with cell-mediated immune responses, including tuberculosis. Although ADA testing has good sensitivity and specificity for tuberculous pericarditis, it is not 100% sensitive or specific. Nevertheless, in this case, considering the clinical and laboratory findings, it would be prudent to stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy.

D: Perform an interventional radiology–guided biopsy of the mass.

Explanation: Given the patient's absence of acute symptoms and stable overall condition, a surgical intervention such as an exploratory laparotomy and mass excision may not be the most reasonable next step. Instead, an interventional radiology–guided biopsy would allow for confirmation of the nature of the mass before resorting to more invasive procedures. Additionally, considering the patient's history and clinical presentation, the mass could potentially be a benign or indolent lesion that may not require immediate surgical intervention.

B: Reactive perforating collagenosis

Explanation: Reactive perforating collagenosis is a rare skin condition that often gets associated with underlying systemic diseases like diabetes, renal disease, and hematological malignancies like leukemia, which are seen in this patient's case. These conditions can produce a wide variety of skin abnormalities that include papules with a puckered center. Reactive perforating collagenosis features an exaggerate pathological skin reaction pattern to various sorts of dermatological injuries or traumas. Then dismantled elastic or collagen fibers move up in the dermal tissue to the epidermal layer to finally undergo extrusion through perforating channels, like in the case of this patient. Transaminase, renal function, and negative blood cultures indicate that options A, C, and D involving infectious agents like Candida, Cryptococci, and Malessezia respectively are unlikely.

516
C: Malignant acanthosis nigricans

Explanation: The patient's presentation of widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques distributed symmetrically, especially in the axillae, anogenital region, inguinal skin, and palms is characteristic of acanthosis nigricans. These symptoms, accompanied by weight loss, anorexia, enlarged thyroid, and abdominal discomfort, as well as remarkably elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and other tumor markers, strongly suggest an underlying malignancy, hence the diagnosis of malignant acanthosis nigricans. This is further confirmed by the papillary structure with hyperkeratosis revealed in the biopsy. The vermilion border and conjunctivae are typically spared in benign acanthosis nigricans, but in this case, they are involved. The involvement of the conjunctiva and oral mucosa is a key sign of malignant acanthosis nigricans associated with intra-abdominal malignancies. This condition is often a cutaneous marker of internal malignancy, often an adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary system.

B: Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Explanation: The presentation of multiple well-defined, erythematous, palpable, purpuralike lesions predominantly present on the trunk and lower extremities along with the gradual onset and absence of common symptoms associated with other options suggest Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV). LCV is known as an inflammation of small vessels presenting as palpable purpura. Other systemic symptoms can accompany this condition, but no other significant symptoms were noted in the patient. The results of the laboratory tests further support this diagnosis as LCV is often accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Although Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, Purpura fulminans, or Henoch-Schönlein purpura could also present with purpuric lesions, they are less likely considering the patient's presentation and test results. Furthermore, additional findings from the chest radiograph and CT scan may be attributed to the patient's long history of smoking, suggesting possible underlying carcinoma which is known to be associated with Cutaneous LCV in some cases.

D

Explanation: This patient presents with sudden-onset, severe chest pain at rest along with nausea, diaphoresis, elevated troponins, and an electrocardiogram showing ST-segment elevation in multiple leads. These findings are consistent with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a type of acute coronary syndrome. The current recommended treatment for STEMI involves immediate reperfusion therapy, if possible. This generally means percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if it can be performed within 90 minutes from the time of the first medical contact. In addition to reperfusion, the patient should also receive optimal medical therapy, which includes aspirin, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (such as clopidogrel), beta blocker, and a statin. This combination aims to reduce clot formation, slow the heart rate to decrease oxygen demand, and control lipid levels to slow progression of atherosclerosis. Therefore, in this case the best treatment option would be to revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention and start medical therapy (Option D).
C: Oral metastasis

Explanation: The patient's history of endometrial serous adenocarcinoma, along with the presentation of an unresolving gingival mass and pain in the posterior mandible, suggest a potential site of metastasis. The tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, all markers that correspond with endometrial origin. This, combined with the negative results for CK20 and TTF-1, which would typically indicate a different source for metastasis, points towards metastatic disease. Furthermore, Pyogenic granuloma and Gingival/periodontal abscess would be unlikely to persist on long-term and after dental interventions, moreover Squamous cell carcinoma usually doesn't show such an immune profile. Hence, based on this information, the diagnosis is likely to be oral metastasis from the previously diagnosed endometrial serous adenocarcinoma.
C
520
C: Type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) pharyngitis

Explanation: Although the patient has a history of pharyngeal gonorrhea and has been taking prophylactic medication, the fact that he does not present with any genital symptoms and there was no sign of infection during examination rules out a recurrent bout of gonorrhea. Mononucleosis usually causes symptoms like fatigue, body aches, and swollen lymph nodes, which are absent in this case. Diphtheria is also not likely as the patient received his last booster relatively recently, and it typically presents with pseudomembrane formation rather than the ulcerative lesions described. 

The persistent sore throat and odynophagia, as well as the findings from the nasopharyngoscopy, point towards HSV-2 pharyngitis. This form of herpetic pharyngitis can create ulcerative lesions with exudate and erythema. Furthermore, his negative rapid Strep test and the lack of response to amoxicillin clavulanate also support a diagnosis other than a typical bacterial pharyngitis like streptococcus. The patient's last sexual history and examination of possible lesions elsewhere would be beneficial for confirming this diagnosis.
C
521
C: Nocardiosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation and laryngotracheoscopic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of nocardiosis. The history of a kidney transplant, the patient's immunocompromised state, chronic cough, and dyspnea, along with branching organisms observed on biopsy, strongly suggest Nocardia infection. Nocardia is a gram-positive, partially acid-fast, aerobic actinomycete that can cause opportunistic infections, primarily in immunocompromised hosts. Infections commonly produce suppurative or granulomatous lesions and can be localized or disseminated. The respiratory tract, particularly the lungs, is frequently involved. Nocardiosis can mimic malignancies or other infections, requiring a high index of suspicion and appropriate microbiological techniques for diagnosis.

Explanation: According to the clinical information provided, the patient has incidental lobulated polypoid soft tissue masses in the nasal cavities arising from the olfactory clefts, which shows seromucinous and respiratory epithelial submucosal glands on biopsy. These findings exclude options A, B, and C: Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma (the biopsy did not reveal any atypical or malignant cells), Inflammatory nasal polyps (there were no inflammatory symptoms or histological findings), and Inverted Papilloma (characterized by invaginating squamous epithelium which was not seen in this case). Therefore, based on the findings, the most probable diagnosis is D: Nasal cavity hamartoma, which is a benign tumor-like formation characterized by the overgrowth of mature cells and tissues normally present in the affected part of the body, and can consist of various types of cells including seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands.

523
C: Order cranial magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: In this particular case, the patient's symptoms of gaze-provoked exotropia and her medical history indicating previous pituitary macroadenoma suggest a possible lesion in the brain causing these symptoms. Given the potential for neurological lesions or abnormalities, the best first step would be to order cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the brain and ocular structures further. This will provide insight into the extent, if any, of structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing her symptoms. Although medications and surgeries could help manage symptoms or reconstruct ocular alignment, these management options would not address the root cause of the symptoms, and without further understanding of potential neurological involvement, might not be effective. Antibody testing could be useful if there were suspicion of an autoimmune or inflammatory condition, but it would not be the first step given the patient's history and symptoms.

B: Complete an excisional biopsy of the lesion.

Explanation: Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most prudent next step would be to conduct an excisional biopsy of the lesion to establish a definitive diagnosis. The combination of the lesion's duration, vascular nature, and location suggest it might be a congenital hemangioma or possibly a conjunctival lymphangioma. The vascular nature and overall stability of the lesion, however, make these entities more probable than a malignant condition. The role of biopsy is not only to provide a definitive diagnosis, but also potentially curative treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging, needle drainage, or systemic propranolol treatment are not first-line management in this scenario considering the size, location, and the stable nature of the lesion. Despite a necessary reconstruction if the lesion is removed, it is less likely for the lesion to recur if excised completely.

B: Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy. 

Explanation: Given the location and size of the mass, iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is considered the treatment of choice as it can provide targeted radiation to a large, localized ocular tumor. This technique also helps preserve the eye's structure and function, reducing the risks associated with other treatments. Photodynamic therapy is typically reserved for smaller lesions, Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy injections primarily target neovascularization, and external beam radiotherapy is a more aggressive approach often reserved for larger, sight-threatening lesions or failed prior treatments. It's essential to consider potential side effects, overall health status, and the patients personal preference when determining the best course of treatment.

B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain/orbits.

Explanation: The patient's glaucomatous findings along with a supratemporal pit in the right optic nerve, thinning, and relative afferent pupillary defect are suspicious for optic nerve pathology and could be due to anterior -junctional or chiasmal/compressive lesions. Additionally, the patient's history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, episodes of systemic symptoms such as tremors, ataxia, and dysarthria are indicative of possible underlying neurological abnormalities. An MRI of the brain and orbits would be the most effective next step to rule out entities such as gliomas, optic nerve drusen, orbital lesions, or other structural brain dysfunctions that could be affecting the visual field.

527
D

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, respiratory distress, and auscultation findings, his presentation is suggestive of septic shock secondary to possible bacterial endocarditis (given the soft S1 and poor dentition as a potential source of bacterial infection). While all the listed choices can be part of the management plan, the immediate next step would be to start empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover common organisms responsible for endocarditis, pending blood culture results. The patient should be monitored closely in the Intensive Care Unit. Further management including potential surgery or intra-aortic balloon pump placement will depend on the patient's clinical condition and echocardiogram findings.
B: Scleromyxedema

Explanation: The presence of symmetrical, monomorphous, firm, waxy papules that coalesce into plaques especially on the face and upper trunk, with accompanying symptoms such as joint contractures and muscle weakness, are characteristic findings in scleromyxedema (also known as Arndt-Gottron syndrome). This condition is typified by excessive mucin deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and fibrosis in the skin. The λ-monoclonal gammopathy seen in serum protein electrophoresis is a definitive clue, which is present in almost all cases of scleromyxedema, but not in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, lepromatous leprosy, or scleroderma.

529
D: Kyrle disease.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of diabetes mellitus, the presentation, location, and progression of his skin lesions, as well as the histological findings of compact hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, and bandlike lymphocyte infiltrate in the superficial dermis, Kyrle disease is the most likely diagnosis. Kyrle disease is a rare, acquired, perforating dermatosis that usually occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease. Its primary lesions are hyperkeratotic papulonodules or plaques with a central keratotic plug, which directly aligns with the patient's symptoms. The other options can be ruled out because they do not fit with the clinical picture as closely; while some features may align, Kyrle disease is the only option that encompasses all the patient's symptoms and history.

B: Paroxysmal dyskinesia 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms seem to correspond with Paroxysmal dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by episodic involuntary movements. This condition is different from epileptic seizures which typically show characteristic changes in EEG during an event. In this case, EEG did not reveal any significant epileptic activity correlating with the episodes. Furthermore, the nature of the movements, being involuntary and nonsuppressible jerks that are not brought on by action or external stimuli, fits with the description of Paroxysmal dyskinesia. The movements in this disorder typically involve one or more parts of the body, as seen in this patient affecting the right face, arm, and leg. The onset of movements without warning and the spontaneous resolution also matches with this condition.

C: Obtain laboratory workup for uveitis. 

Explanation: Given the patient’s symptoms and findings of cystoid macular edema and intraretinal hemorrhages, one potential diagnosis that needs to be ruled out is uveitis, which can be secondary to a systemic disease or condition. Uveitis can cause chronic eye redness, decreased vision, and macular edema – all symptoms observed in this patient. Therefore, obtaining a laboratory workup for uveitis helps to ascertain whether this condition is the underlying problem. Additionally, antivascular endothelial growth factor agents may not be as effective in treating macular edema secondary to uveitis. Systemic steroids without a proper workup could exacerbate a potential infectious uveitis. Cerebral angiography may not be needed at this point as the imaging protocols did not show vascular abnormalities. Hence, the best next step is to conduct a workup for uveitis.

532
A: Computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of gradual onset of binocular diplopia, ptosis, and an absence of symptom fluctuation or other systemic symptoms are commonly associated with mass effect or fibrotic changes in the orbit, commonly from thyroid eye disease, age-related changes, or a neoplasm. It is essential to rule out the compressive lesion causing restrictive strabismus or a focal neurologic dysfunction. Hence, imaging of the orbit is crucial, and CT scan of the orbit with contrast is an appropriate next step aiding in the diagnosis and further management of the condition. While the other choices like Myasthenia gravis testing, strabismus surgery referral, and thyroid function test can be important for differential diagnoses, an imaging study should be the first step to detect a possible structural anomaly.

B: Incisional biopsy

Explanation: Given the unusual presentation and unclear diagnosis of this corneal mass, it would be prudent to obtain an incisional biopsy. This procedure would allow for histopathological examination of the tissue, which could provide crucial information about the type and nature of the mass. Furthermore, biopsy could aid in guiding the treatment decision-making process. Options like local therapy with 5-fluorouracil might be beneficial for certain tumors but could be potentially harmful or ineffective if this lesion represents a non-malignant condition. Waiting and observing is not ideal due to the mass's continuous growth. An excisional biopsy could be considered too aggressive without a definitive diagnosis.

534
A: Bleomycin toxic effects

Explanation: Bleomycin toxic effect seems to be the most plausible diagnosis given the linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on the woman's arms, back, and legs presenting 15 days after starting chemotherapy with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). Flagellate erythema, a rare cutaneous manifestation characterized by streaky hyperpigmentation, often associated with pruritus, can be induced by bleomycin, an antineoplastic agent that cross-links DNA and inhibits its synthesis. The symptoms usually appear after the first or second course of chemotherapy, which correlates to this patient's timeline. Also, the fact that pruritus and lesions did not respond well to antihistamines and topical steroids also supports bleomycin as the culprit. Other options such as paraneoplastic skin disease and vinblastine toxic effects are unlikely based on the timing of rash in relation to chemotherapy and the specific skin findings. Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is less likely considering the timeline of symptoms and the absence of a childbearing state.

B: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 

Explanation: The clinical examination reveals solitary isolated nodules with induration and lymphadenopathy, which aren't typical signs of Kaposi sarcoma. Though Burkitt Lymphoma can also be a differential because of its association with HIV, the manifestation is not congruent with a typical presentation. Leukemia cutis usually presents with disseminated skin lesions rather than isolated nodules. Positive immunohistochemical staining for c-Myc, often seen in approximately 5%-15% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), aids the diagnosis as well. The location of the tumor inside the subcutaneous tissue also suggests DLBCL rather than the other options, which usually occur within the skin or mucous membranes. A high HIV viral load and low CD4 count also increase the likelihood of a lymphoproliferative disorder like DLBCL.

536
D: Administer intravenous thiamine therapy.

Explanation: This patient is presenting with symptoms of new-onset heart failure, likely correlating with alcoholic cardiomyopathy given his history of alcohol abuse. The absence of ischemic symptoms, negative troponin values, and unremarkable electrocardiogram make ischemic heart disease unlikely. Alongside this, the elevated pro–brain natriuretic peptide levels and evidence of biventricular failure on echocardiography support a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. In chronic alcoholics, thiamine deficiency can lead to wet beriberi, a condition that can present as high-output heart failure. Therefore, intravenous thiamine therapy is both an important component of treatment for potential concomitant alcoholic wet beriberi and a more appropriate initial intervention rather than options A-C, which may not directly address the underlying cause or potential complications related to the patient's alcohol history.
D

537
A: Simple ranula

Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging findings of a large cystic mass in the floor of the mouth, which is blue and transparent, are characteristic of a simple ranula. Ranulas result from the rupture of a salivary gland duct and subsequent mucin spillage into the surrounding tissues, which leads to a pseudocyst formation. They often present as a painless, slowly growing, bluish mass on the floor of the mouth, just as in this case. The other options are less likely because an epidermoid cyst generally presents with symptoms, a vascular malformation would typically present with a vascular mass on imaging, and an odontogenic abscess would be expected to be painful and associated with a dental infection.
B
538
B: Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion 

Explanation: The clinical history of progressive left-sided facial pain and swelling, sinus inflammation, epistaxis, and nearly total septal perforation in a patient with a social history of cocaine use suggests a cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion (CIMDL). CIMDL is a destructive necrotic process affecting the central part of the face, often presenting with facial pain, purulent nasal secretions, epistaxis, and a septal perforation, much like the clinical presentation in this case. Furthermore, the use of cocaine, a powerful vasoconstrictor, can lead to decreased blood supply, ischemia, necrosis, and delayed wound healing. Chronic exposure can result in progressive tissue destruction and necrosis. The remaining options are less likely given the patient's history and progressive symptoms.
B
539
B: Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures. 

Explanation: The patient's exposure to a farm environment, febrile illness with a rash primarily on the trunk and extremities, migratory polyarthralgia, and blood culture findings indicate disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). This condition often presents with fever, a characteristic rash, and polyarthralgias or septic arthritis. The rash can be macular, papular, pustular, or hemorrhagic. Joint pain often fluctuates from joint to joint, particularly the wrists, knees, and ankles. Analysis of joint fluid (if present) and culture can further support the diagnosis, often growing Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

B: Core needle biopsy of the lesion

Explanation: A core needle biopsy of the lesion would likely be the most appropriate next step in this case. Given the size, the location, and the irregular features of the mass as seen on imaging, a needle biopsy would allow for histologic examination of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy, without the invasive nature of an incisional biopsy. A simple excision without a biopsy could potentially be harmful and inadequate if the mass is malignant. And given the patient's age and the size of the mass, repeating imaging in 6 months would potentially delay necessary treatment.

541
B: Bullous Sweet syndrome

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation with edema, multiple papules, blisters, crusted erosions, and tense bullae, along with irregular fever, does not perfectly align with any of the options. However, Bullous Sweet syndrome, a rare variant of Sweet syndrome, is the most plausible diagnosis given the general clinical presentation, rapid progression of skin lesions, irregular fever, and the inadequate response to anti-viral treatment. Additionally, Sweet syndrome often presents with leukocytosis and neutrophilia, which correspond with the patient's abnormal laboratory results. The presence of blisters and bullae is a characteristic finding of Bullous Sweet syndrome as well. Confirmatory diagnosis would require histopathological examination showing the characteristic dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis. It should be emphasized that this case is quite complicated and diagnosis would require more clinical and laboratory information. All of the given options can present somewhat similarly and their diagnostic criteria overlap significantly; therefore, without further information, the diagnosis remains uncertain, and this is only a tentative suggestion.

542
D: Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma. 

Explanation: The patient’s clinical history of breast carcinoma and the pattern of violaceous swelling with telangiectasia and necrosis suggests a possible diagnosis of Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma. This rare form of metastasis often appears on the face as a violaceous and edematous lesion, resembling angiosarcoma or other vascular entities. Necrosis is also frequently observed in this condition. The definitive diagnosis is typically confirmed through histopathological analysis featuring infiltrating atypical cells in the dermis, which mostly descend from intravascular tumor emboli. Further supportive evidence comes from the immunohistochemical staining showing the cells to be positive for epithelial markers and negative for vascular markers. The patient's history of breast carcinoma strongly leans towards this diagnosis. Although Cutaneous angiosarcoma, Radiation dermatitis, and Wolf isotopic response may present signs similar to the current case, the particular combination of clinical presentation and patient's medical history makes Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma the most plausible diagnosis.

B: Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder

Explanation: The histopathological features of the abdominal skin eruption, specifically the atypical, hyperchromatic infiltrate and the appearance of atypical-appearing lymphoid cells with nuclear hyperchromasia and scant cytoplasm, are suggestive of lymphoproliferative disease. The symptoms also started after a significant reduction of the immunosuppressive therapy, which lines up with posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). PTLD is a known complication of solid organ transplantation and is associated with high levels of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the patient had a history of plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, which would indicate a higher risk of recurrence. While the presented clinical situation could theoretically also be associated with infections or a different type of lymphoma, the specific circumstances and histopathologic findings make PTLD the most likely diagnosis.

A: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes 

Explanation: This case as described is highly suggestive of a disorder of systemic mitochondrial energy production. The chronic gait imbalance, the acute strokelike episodes, and the MRI findings supporting bilaterally symmetric involvement of the brain's white matter, coupled with the family history of neurological problems, are most consistent with a diagnosis of Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). This syndrome is characterized by onset in childhood or adolescence, normally before age 20. Symptoms can include episodes resembling strokes, seizures, dementia, and other neurological disorders. Additional issues may involve muscle weakness and wasting, hearing loss, and lactic acidosis.

D: Initiate intravenous penicillin therapy. 

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation and the result of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, he may have neurosyphilis, which can present with vision problems. The large white lesions in the macula and the hyperfluorescent lesions indicated on the angiography also support this diagnosis. The standard treatment for neurosyphilis is intravenous penicillin therapy, as this infection is primarily caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum and can have a severe impact on the nervous system if left untreated. Increasing the dose of prednisone wouldn't be advisable as it's a steroid and may have a negative effect on bacterial infections. Antiviral therapy wouldn't be recommended as syphilis is a bacterial infection. Bilateral posterior sub-tenon triamcinolone injections may not be suitable as they are typically used to reduce inflammation, not treat an underlying infection.

546
C: Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography.

Explanation: This patient has signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including papilledema, afferent pupillary defect, loss of vision, and the presence of a partially empty sella on MRI. Increased ICP can occur for many reasons, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension, venous sinus thrombosis (VST), and intracranial mass. In this case, there is no mass effect such as a tumor or hemorrhage present on brain MRI to account for the patient's raised ICP. VST is a common cause of raised ICP and could be evaluated via cerebral venography. Consequently, option C: Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography, is the ideal next step. This procedure will help identify VST or narrowing of the cerebral venous sinuses, which could be causing the increased ICP. Despite the patient’s BD, her symptoms are not following ordinary optic neuropathy of BD, further indicating this is not just a BD exacerbation, but a separate pathology that needs to be investigated.

A: Obtain a family medical history and genetic testing. 

Explanation: Deciding on an intervention such as surgery should ideally be based on the functional impact of a condition. In this case, the 8-year-old girl has stable vision and is performing well in school. Despite bilateral atypical epiretinal membranes, her visual acuity is 20/40 in both eyes. With a lack of other significant medical history, further investigation needs to be done to determine if there's a potential genetic component to her condition. Thus, obtaining a family medical history and genetic testing is advisable. Also, it's important to track any changes in her condition before rushing into surgery. Therefore, option A should be considered first.

B: Conjunctival biopsy

Explanation: The sudden onset and rapid enlargement of the firm, localized conjunctival mass in this patient suggests a neoplastic process. A conjunctival biopsy is necessary to obtain tissue for histopathological evaluation. This will allow the precise diagnosis of the condition and guide further treatment and management decisions. The other investigations like topical corticosteroid eyedrops (A), complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests (C), and serum and urine electrophoresis (D) could be potentially useful in the right clinical context, but they would not directly address the primary concern, which is to establish the D: diagnosis of the conjunctival mass.

549
B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests

Explanation: This patient's chronic alcoholism, diminished corneal sensation, dendritiform ulcer, and absence of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest a diagnosis of neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), possibly due to herpetic keratitis. Herpetic disease is the most frequent cause of NK, which results from damage to the trigeminal nerve fibers mediating corneal sensation. This damage disrupts the trophic and reflexive functions needed for maintaining corneal integrity. NK can be seen in patients with corneal hypesthesia from long-standing diabetes, contact lens use, or chemical burns; however, this patient's alcoholism is a risk factor for nutritional deficiencies, including thiamine, which may lead to neuropathy including corneal sensory nerves. Some patients with unilateral herpes simplex virus or herpes zoster ophthalmicus may have a history of typical dendritiform corneal lesions; others may only have nonspecific symptoms of conjunctivitis (eg, tearing, foreign body sensation), episcleritis, or iritis. Chronic alcoholism is a risk factor for poor wound healing, compromised immune function, nutritional deficiency, and noncompliance, which may contribute to treatment failure in corneal disease. Given the high prevalence of herpes simplex virus and its therapeutic implications, cultures for this virus should be performed promptly in this context, even if confocal microscopy is inconclusive due to poor sensitivity. Antiviral therapy should be started if herpetic keratitis is suspected, because even a few days of delay can worsen the disease. Ophthalmic consultation is needed for optimal management of these patients.

B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests. 

Explanation: Given the patient's consumption of alcohol and his overall health status, the next best step would be option B, as it tackles the issue at a potential viral level. The presence of a nonhealing corneal ulcer that is not responding to standard management may be due to viral infection, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV keratitis is the most common cause of corneal blindness in the United States and the most common source of infectious blindness in the Western world. This could explain the patient's condition and the lack of healing despite the administration of antibiotics. Despite the patient's extensive alcohol intake, it would be less likely that his condition is due to vitamin A deficiency (Option D), a condition which is associated with xerophthalmia, or dry eye, and night blindness rather than corneal ulcers.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, signs and unresponsiveness to antibiotics should raise concern for a herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, particularly in the setting of a diminished corneal sensation. Thus, herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection test would be the appropriate next step. This disease can elicit substantial inflammation that culminates in stromal thinning, often accompanied by a diminished corneal sensation. Alcoholism can predispose to HSV keratitis due to its suppressive effects on the immune system. Therefore, despite the absence of dendritic or geographic ulcers typically present in HSV keratitis, there should be a high index of suspicion for this condition. Meanwhile, the use of confocal microscopy would be helpful in identifying fungal or acanthamoeba keratitis, but these are less likely based on the existing negative cultures. The broadening of antibiotic coverage may also be considered, but primarily in the case of a resistance to the current antibiotic treatment. Checking serum vitamin A levels would be relevant if systemic symptoms of a vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness, were present.

A: Angiosarcoma

Explanation: Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy that often arises in the setting of prior irradiation. It can appear as multifocal erythematous papules, plaques, or nodules, sometimes with ulceration, and is often misdiagnosed as a benign condition due to its benign-appearing clinical features. This patient's prolonged history of irradiation, along with the appearance and location of lesions, makes angiosarcoma a likely diagnosis. Leukemia cutis, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma can also share some similar clinical features with angiosarcoma but are less likely in this case given the patient's specific history and the appearance of the lesions.

B: Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis

Explanation: The clinical findings outlined in the case such as the localized erythematous induration, diffuse swelling of the thigh, painful reddening and the biopsy revealing lobular lymphocytic panniculitis all suggest an inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, which is known as panniculitis. Given her history of recent treatment escalation with an immunotherapy drug nivolumab, this might have induced the condition and explains the rapid evolution and fluorodeoxyglucose-positive soft tissue activity. Therefore, Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis seems to be the most accurate diagnosis.

B: Start intravenous heparin

Explanation: Given the presentation of the patient and her recent heart surgery, the finding of a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve is indicative of a valve thrombosis. This condition is often treated with anticoagulation therapy, typically intravenous heparin, which is why option B is the most appropriate next step. Although surgical intervention or thrombolytic therapy may be considered in some cases, initiating anticoagulation is typically the primary course of action. The subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5 further supports the need for anticoagulation. The other options may be considered, but should not be the first step in managing this patient's condition.

553
D: Sebaceous carcinoma. 

Explanation: The case involves a patient with a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that has been neglected for 4 years. As he has no notable lymphadenopathy, and a non–contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus, we can rule out a Pott puffy tumor, which is a rare complication marked by subperiosteal abscess associated with frontal sinus osteomyelitis and often presents with frontal swelling, erythema, and tenderness. Furthermore, this tumor is usually seen in adolescents and children, not adults in their 70s.

A Mucocele also seems unlikely as these benign, cystic lesions are filled with mucus and would not typically cause the bony destruction seen in the CT scan, nor contain the necroinflammatory debris identified in the histopathological investigation. 

Basal cell carcinoma, considered the most common type of skin cancer, often present as pearly papules with central craters. This presentation does not fit with the firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass seen in this patient. Furthermore, basal cell carcinomas do not generally cause bony destruction.

Therefore, the most probable diagnosis, given the patient's history of tobacco abuse, age, the size, and site of the lesion, and the histopathological analysis, is a Sebaceous carcinoma. This is a rare but aggressive malignancy arising from the sebaceous glands. The neoplastic cells identified in the biopsy (epithelioid cells with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli), the size and location of the mass, and the patient's age and health history all align with a diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma.
D
554
D: Schistosomiasis

Explanation: Schistosomiasis is caused by a parasitic infection. The patient's history of frequent swimming in Lake Tanganyika, located in Eastern Africa, aligns with the endemic locations of this parasite. The clinical manifestations in this patient including hearing loss, vertigo, and urinary issues are compatible with both the cerebral and urinary forms of Schistosomiasis. The observed lesion in the cerebellar peduncle and the thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve could be attributed to brain infection or inflammation caused by the parasite. Same goes for the mass in the prostate, it could be granulomatous inflammation due to Schistosoma haematobium, whichpreferentially infects the urinary tract. While prostate cancer, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis are valid considerations for these symptoms, the patient's history and imaging findings most strongly suggest a diagnosis of Schistosomiasis.
D
555
B: Lupus vulgaris

Explanation: Lupus vulgaris is a type of cutaneous tuberculosis. This diagnosis is suggested by the presence of erythematous papules and plaques on the skin, along with cervical lymphadenopathy. The demonstration of granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis on skin biopsy and the detection of acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis, particularly Lupus vulgaris. In this form of tuberculosis, the spread is usually through autoinoculation from an internal focus or through direct inoculation from an external source. The other options like fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, and cutaneous leishmaniasis also present as chronic granulomatous disorders of the skin; however, the histopathological examination and the Ziehl-Neelsen stain help differentiate Lupus vulgaris from these diseases.

556
B: Obtain additional imaging with computed tomography (CT)

Explanation: Given the patient's signs and symptoms, particularly nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig's sign, these indicate meningitis. However, the patient's CSF analysis does not support bacterial meningitis. Furthermore, the patient's history of pseudogout and recent onset of knee pain and swelling suggest the possibility of pseudogout flare or, less likely, septic arthritis. Given the history of a renal transplant, he is also prone to infection, but blood and CSF cultures were negative and he has no focal neurological deficits. On the other hand, the MRI scan yielded reactive marrow changes in the cervical spine, which may indicate degenerative changes or may be the result of infection or malignancy. In order to further diagnose, a CT scan can be performed that could reveal any crystal deposits or other pathology in the patient’s joints or elsewhere, particularly due to its superior ability in imaging calcification and ossification. Therefore, the next step should be to obtain a CT scan to help identify any possible crystal arthropathy or other pathology.

A: Brain magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation: The patient's elevated ESR and symptoms of headache and vision disturbances suggest giant cell arteritis (GCA). However, the temporal artery biopsy result was negative, indicating that GCA may not be the cause of the symptoms. Before moving to empirical treatment, we need to rule out other conditions that could cause these symptoms. Thus, other causes of this headache and blurred vision, such as intracranial lesions, should be evaluated through imaging studies such as brain MRI. Furthermore, imaging will exclude any structures that were not imaged during the biopsy. This may indicate that the region biopsied was not affected by the disease even though the disease is still present elsewhere. Methotrexate or sumatriptan are therapeutic options that should only be considered once all differential diagnoses have been explored, particularly considering the invasive nature of these treatments. Serum protein electrophoresis could help to identify some systemic inflammatory conditions, but it would not directly clarify the cause of this patient's presenting symptoms.

The condition may appear suddenly or develop gradually over months to years. The presentation described in the case, such as the symmetrical lip enlargement with infiltrative erythematous and skin-colored papules and nodules extending onto the vermilion border, is typical of granulomatous cheilitis.

C: Erdheim-Chester disease

Explanation: The presentation of xanthelasma with retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerotic bone lesions and foamy macrophages suggests a possible diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). ECD is a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by system infiltration by foamy histiocytes, that may affect multiple organs. This diagnosis contrasts with xanthelasma palpebrum, which is generally limited to periorbital yellow plaques; and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, which typically involves skin with concomitant paraproteinemia. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is typically characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells with Birbeck granules, which is not mentioned here. The fixation of CD68 by the retroperitoneal and eyelid histiocytes supports a histiocytic disorder, like ECD. Although the clinicopathological picture is sufficient for diagnosis, molecular analysis can be done to identify mutations in the MAPK pathway, which is typical of histiocytic disorders, further confirming the diagnosis.

C: Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis

Explanation: Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is a rare, recurrent inflammatory disease characterized by sterile pustules. It was initially described in Japan and is classically seen in healthy, middle-aged Japanese men. The presentation of EPF can be highly variable, but classically begins as pruritic, erythematous papules and pustules that coalesce into annular, erythematous plaques with a tendency towards central clearing. The patient's culture-negative pustular disease and lack of response to potent topical corticosteroids are also typical of EPF. Histopathology, while not entirely specific, frequently shows a dense, dermal infiltrate of eosinophils associated with hair follicles. EPF should be differentiated from other inflammatory and neoplastic dermatoses that can exhibit eosinophils, such as folliculotropic mycosis fungoides and Majocchi granuloma. In contrast to EPF, these conditions typically have a prominent interface dermatitis and follicular mucinosis (folliculotropic mycosis fungoides) or a dermal infiltrate of neutrophils and evidence of fungal elements (Majocchi granuloma). Papulopustular rosacea, which may have overlapping features, typically spares the palms and soles.

C: Susac syndrome

Explanation: The patient's clinical syndrome of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion (as noted in retinal arterial plaques), and sensorineural hearing loss, combined with the characteristic MRI findings of corpus callosum involvement and DWI-enhancing white matter lesions, is suggestive of Susac syndrome. Susac syndrome is an autoimmune endotheliopathy that causes microinfarctions in the brain, retina, and cochlea. The enhancement of the white matter lesions, the lack of spinal cord involvement, and the normal IgG index make multiple sclerosis less likely. The absence of-mouth or genital ulcers makes Behçet disease less likely. CADASIL typically presents with migraine, recurrent strokes, and cognitive impairment, but hearing loss is not a common feature. Moreover, the MRI in CADASIL usually reveals subcortical infarcts but can also reveal lesions in the temporal pole and external capsule, not seen in this patient. The lesions in the corpus callosum in CADASIL are typically symmetrical, unlike in this case. Additionally, the prominent leptomeningeal enhancement distinguishing is not typical in CADASIL.

B: Observe the patient 

Explanation: The features reported and presented in the case, including "fixed swirl circles" in the vision, pain and discomfort during eye movements, and healthy optic disc with no macular abnormalities, are characteristic of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). AMN is a rare condition, often self-limiting and typically bilaterally symmetrical. Neither fluorescein angiography or magnetic resonance imaging are likely to add significant diagnostic benefit, and oral corticosteroids are not typically the appropriate first line treatment. The OCT findings consistent with AMN provide enough information at this stage. There appears to be no urgent pathology that would require immediate intervention. As the patient is young and otherwise healthy, it may be appropriate to monitor her symptoms and progress closely in the first instance. Further intervention may be required if new symptoms occur or current symptoms worsen.

C. The severity and extent of the hemorrhages, along with systemic symptoms of fever, chills, and night sweats, raise immediate concern for possible bacterial endocarditis, a severe infection of the heart's inner lining. Endocarditis can lead to septic emboli that manifest as Roth spots, and while it is a rare cause of retinal hemorrhages, it is potentially life-threatening. Immediate action is needed, including the initiation of intravenous antibiotics and a cardiology consultation. Other options like a fluorescein angiogram (A) or complete blood count (D) are important for further diagnosis, but are secondary to addressing the suspected infection. Providing stool softeners (B) would be useful if Valsalva retinopathy was suspected, however, the patient does not exhibit signs of this condition.
B: Biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion. 

Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation, it is important to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment. A biopsy is needed here as the patient has a pigmented conjunctival lesion, which could signify different pathologies. The biopsy helps to accurately diagnose whether the pigmentation is caused by primary acquired melanosis or if there's the existence of ocular surface squamous neoplasia hiding in it, given the suspicious appearance on high-resolution optical coherence tomography. Once the exact condition is determined, appropriate treatment can be tailored. Other options mentioned are not immediately beneficial until there is clear understanding of the underlying condition. For instance, a metastatic workup from an oncologist might be necessary depending on the pathology. Similarly, cryotherapy or oral doxycycline would only be opted for when the specific condition warrants such treatment.

C: Proceed with conjunctival biopsy 

Explanation: Despite the elderly man's normal visual acuity, the presence of follicles on the palpebral conjunctiva might be a sign of a more significant underlying issue. The man's conjunctivitis has not resolved after several months, and conventional treatments and diagnostic tests have not improved his condition or provided an understanding of the cause. Furthermore, the absence of identifiable infectious causes and the unilaterality of the man's condition could suggest a neoplastic process, which can be confirmed or ruled out with a conjunctival biopsy. Hence, despite being a more invasive step, a biopsy seems the most appropriate next step to decide the root cause of the follicular conjunctivitis.

566
C: Measure oxalate levels in blood and urine. 

Explanation: The patient's occupational history of metal work combined with the presentation of crystalline maculopathy make primary and secondary hyperoxaluria the most likely underlying causes. These conditions, characterized by an increased production and urinary excretion of oxalate, can lead to calcium oxalate crystal deposition in various tissues, including the retina. Confirmation of hyperoxaluria requires the measurement of oxalate levels in blood and urine. Requesting a genetic workup or screening for substance abuse would be less relevant considering the patient's occupational exposure and lack of other indicative signs or symptoms. Similarly, examining the retinal periphery would not likely yield additional information since the crystals are concentrated at the macula as per the fundus photography.

D: All of the above. 

Explanation: With an elevated blood pressure and history of kidney failure and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, there is clearly serious underlying systemic illness that needs to be managed, which supports Answer A. Neuroretinitis could be the cause of optic nerve swelling, especially in a young man with cat exposure, supporting Answer B. MRI and MRV of the brain and orbits, as well as a lumbar puncture, can help rule out other potential causes of vision loss and headaches, including elevated intracranial pressure and tumours, respectively, supporting Answer C. Thus, all steps are necessary in this case.

C: Polycythemia rubra vera

Explanation: The case describes an older woman with advanced Alzheimer disease who presents with a high hemoglobin and red blood cell count as well as a generalized itch that worsens after a bath. On examination, she exhibited a florid, erythematous macular eruption over the trunk and limbs but no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. These clinical features, in addition to the persistently high hemoglobin level and increasing lymphocyte count suggest a diagnosis of Polycythemia rubra vera (PRV). PRV is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the overproduction of red blood cells. Itchiness, particularly following a warm bath, is a common symptom in PRV. The skin changes seen in this patient is likely a manifestation of the increased blood flow and congestion caused by the excessive red blood cells. The biopsy findings do not support the diagnoses of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/Sézary syndrome, or cutaneous lupus erythematosus as these conditions would typically present with cellular atypia and epidermal involvement.

569
A: High-dose corticosteroid therapy

Explanation: The patient's elevated IgG4 and C-reactive protein levels, along with the imaging findings, suggest IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), which is a systemic fibroinflammatory condition. Coronary artery involvement in IgG4-RD, although rare, leads to arterial wall thickening, luminal stenosis, and aneurysm formation. Aneurysms due to IgG4-RD have the potential for expansion and rupture if left untreated. High-dose corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy for induction of remission in IgG4-RD. Corticosteroids can stabilize aneurysms, and in some instances, chronic vascular complications of IgG4-RD have been shown to regress. Therefore, the patient should receive high-dose corticosteroid therapy.

570
D: Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma

Explanation: Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma is a possible diagnosis given the clinical and radiological features presented in this case. This patient has a rapidly enlarging tongue mass with leukocytosis, which suggests an aggressive neoplasm. Presence of hypercalcemia in this setting raises suspicion of a malignancy secreting parathyroid hormone-related peptide. Rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma thought to arise from primitive muscle cells, is one such malignancy. The location of mass in tongue, its rapid growth, and associated systemic findings can be seen in pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma. The absence of osseous erosion, cervical lymphadenopathy, and common features of other mentioned diseases (like oral ulceration in eosinophilic ulcer, central necrosis in abscess, and more gradual growth in squamous cell carcinoma) make pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma the most likely diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis needs to be confirmed by histopathological examination.
D
571
B: Gigantiform cementoma 

Explanation: The presence of proliferative fibrous connective tissue, cementum-like hard tissue, and calcified masses of cemento-osseous material observed in the photomicrographs indicate Gigantiform cementoma. Fibrous dysplasia typically presents more irregular trabeculae of woven bone, not the rimming of reactive bone seen in this case, rendering option C less likely. Albers-Schönberg disease (osteopetrosis) is associated with generalized sclerosis of the skeleton, which is not seen here, making option A unlikely. And polyostotic fibroma generally presents as a benign bone tumor that produces osteoid and hemorrhagic, cystic spaces, which contrasts with the findings in this case, thereby ruling out option D. Meanwhile, Gigantiform cementoma is a rare, benign fibrocemento-osseous disease that typically presents in children or adolescents, matching the patient's demographic in this case. Furthermore, expansile growth, aggressive local behavior, and familial occurrence are key aspects of Gigantiform cementoma, which are consistent with the lesions in the patient and her identical twin sister.
B
572
A: Multifocal basal cell adenoma

Explanation: The presence of multiple, hyperenhancing nodules in the upper lip without local bony erosion or cervical lymphadenopathy suggests a diagnosis of multifocal basal cell adenoma. This is a benign tumor that often presents with multiple nodules or masses, most commonly in the parotid gland or upper lip. Despite patient's smoking history, which increases risk for malignancy, the lack of associated pain, bleeding, recent trauma, and other constitutional symptoms also favor a benign process. Additionally, basal cell adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are often associated with bony erosion, which is not present in this case. Canalicular adenoma is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a single mass, rather than multiple nodules like seen in this case.
C
573
A: Biopsy the lesions. 

Explanation: The recommended step here is a biopsy of the lesions to further clarify the nature of this disease process. The presentation of periodic painful, pruritic, vesicular lesions raises several differential considerations, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, zosteriform herpes simplex, localized bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis. While HSV infection or a shingles outbreak could fit this clinical presentation, it is a little bit unusual for these conditions to persist over a span of 8 years. Bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis are less likely given the history of painful and pruritic episodes and the patient's young age. Thus, by performing a biopsy, the clinician can confirm the diagnosis and subsequently develop a tailored treatment plan.

B: Exploratory laparotomy

Explanation: Given this patient's persistent severe abdominal pain and the computed tomography (CT) scan findings of mesenteric vascular compromise, emergent exploratory laparotomy is the next step. The reported signs and symptoms are suggestive of mesenteric ischemia, which can be caused by arterial or venous occlusion. Mesenteric ischemia is considered a surgical emergency due to the risk of bowel necrosis and subsequent perforation. Delaying definitive surgical management could contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Diagnostic processes such as esophagogastrojejunostomy, diagnostic laparoscopy, or highly selective mesenteric angiography could delay valuable time and not suitable in this emergency context.

A: Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc 

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and symptoms aligning with pancytopenia, potential nutritional deficiencies may be depleting the red and white blood cells and platelets in his body. RYGB can lead to malabsorption of nutrients like iron, copper and zinc that are essential for red blood cell production. His current medications and lack of abnormal findings in his recent CT scan and bone marrow tests also indicate that this condition is not likely the result of a pathological cause or other diseases. Therefore, assessing his trace element levels would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the cause of his pancytopenia.
A
cellvalue empty
576
D: Bullous pemphigoid. 

Explanation: The histopathology characteristics, such as the subepidermal blister and the mixed inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, are highly suggestive of Bullous pemphigoid. Moreover, the patient's recurrent history of the skin lesions, symptom-free periods, and ineffectiveness of initial treatments further support this diagnosis. Linear IgA bullous dermatitis (Option A) could also present superimposed eosinophilic infiltrate and subepidermal blisters but generally occur along with linear depositions of IgA at the basement membrane zone, which is not mentioned here. Herpes virus infection (Option C) could be ruled out as the patient was vaccinated against varicella zoster virus and no clinical or histological features indicated viral inclusion bodies. Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta (Option B) is also unlikely as the patient denies self-inflicting the lesions. Thus, further serology tests for autoantibodies and other markers of Bullous pemphigoid would be the optimum subsequent steps towards diagnosis.

577
B: Prurigo pigmentosa

Explanation: The results from the skin biopsy, which showed signs of epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, spongiosis, necrotic keratinocytes and basal layer pigmentation suggests a diagnosis of Prurigo pigmentosa. In addition, the description of the skin lesions aligns well with this condition. Prurigo pigmentosa, also known as Nagashima disease, is a rare skin condition characterized by recurrent itchy, erythematous papules that resolve with pigmentation. The condition most commonly affects adolescents and young adults, particularly females. The reticulation on her skin is also characteristic of prurigo pigmentosa. The other conditions mentioned do not perfectly fit with the presented symptoms and biopsy results. For example, confluent and reticulated papillomatosis generally does not present with erythema or itching, Dowling-Degos disease usually affects the face and extremities, and Lichen planus pigmentosus typically presents with diffuse hyperpigmentation without prominent papules.

578
B: Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis

Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent joint pain and salmon-pink maculopapular eruption signifies cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis (CFAEA), an under-recognized entity that is often confused with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is characterized by episodes of arthritis in combination with a distinctive cutaneous eruption. Although this condition's pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is believed to be a non-infectious complication of the chronic inflammation inherent to cystic fibrosis. In comparison, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis typically presents with daily spiking fevers, which this patient lacks. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy epresents with periostitis and bony changes of the distal extremities along with clubbing, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Lastly, serum sickness-like reaction usually occurs after medication exposure, which hasn't been terported. Therefore, diagnosis of cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis (option B) appears most fitting.

579
C: Diabetic striatopathy

Explanation: Diabetic striatopathy, also known as hyperglycemic chorea, is characterized by hyperglycemia-induced, unilateral basal ganglia changes with associated chorea or hemichorea. Given this patient's history of long-standing type 2 diabetes and previous severe hyperglycemia incident, along with the presentation of persistent chorea in the left upper extremity and T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and lentiform nucleus found in the MRI, diabetic striatopathy is the most likely diagnosis. The absence of other systemic or neurological abnormalities also favors this diagnosis. Other options, such as postinfectious/autoimmune chorea and paraneoplastic chorea, are less likely due to the absence of recent infection, HIV risk, and negative general cancer screening results. Acute stroke symptoms would typically present with more acute onset and could include symptoms beyond chorea. Furthermore, a stroke would likely show restricted diffusion on MRI, which is not present in this case.

B: Perform scleral biopsy

Explanation: The treatment options with oral corticosteroids (answer A) and intensive topical corticosteroids have not improved her ocular symptoms, and the current dosage of azathioprine is already quite high, so increasing that dosage (answer D) might not be advisable. Scleral biopsy (answer B) can help determine the exact pathology, like inflammation or infection, helping guide further treatment options. Increasing the topical corticosteroid use (answer C) might not have a significant effect, as the current regimen did not provide improvement. Therefore, considering a scleral biopsy seems a reasonable next step to get more clarity about this complex case. The patient's symptoms might be related to a systemic condition, considering her medical history, or might be an unidentified local eye disease. Luckily any infectious causes have been rules out with the serologic testing, so an inflammatory or autoimmune etiology might be more likely. An earlier or more sufficient diagnosis might help to prevent further damage or loss in visual acuity.

581
B: Automated visual field 

Explanation: In the case presented, the patient has central scotoma, blurry vision in the right eye, and segmental atrophy of the inner retina - all of which relate to possible visual field defects. Therefore, an automated visual field test would be the most appropriate next step as it is designed to map out the visual field of the patient, hence can help in understanding the extent of the visual disturbance. The other tests mentioned may also provide valuable information, but they do not directly address the patient's symptoms. Optical coherence tomography angiography would show the vascular structure of the eye, full-field electroretinogram would measure the electrical responses of various cells in the retina, and microperimetry assesses central and near-central visual field and sensitivity. Therefore answer B: Automated visual field is suggested as the next step.

B: Recheck IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap

Explanation: The sudden drop in intraocular pressure could suggest an overestimation of IOP due to a distorted surgical corneal flap or it could imply a true IOP reduction as a result of effective medical therapy or dehydration of the corneal stroma and raises the suspicion uncontrolled inflammation. However, the decrease in visual acuity and increased corneal edema suggest hydration. Rechecking the IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap could rule out or confirm local pressure from distorted surgical corneal flap as the cause. The other options may not address the immediate concern of discerning the reason behind these changes.

583
C: Treat with oral corticosteroids.

Explanation: This is an atypical presentation and, given the relatively quick onset of symptoms and lack of tumor-specific findings (tumor-feeding vessels, tumor seeding etc.), the first step would ideally involve a non-invasive treatment approach while monitoring the child closely. Histological diagnosis would certainly be ideal, however, given the potential risks and the clinical presentation that is not strongly indicative of malignancy (retinoblastoma), oral corticosteroids could be initiated. This course of treatment could target inflammatory conditions like choroidal granulomas or inflammatory pseudotumors, which could present in a similar manner observed in this case. If there was no reduction in the size of the mass or improvement in symptoms following a period of corticosteroid treatment, further investigations including a possible biopsy would then be necessary to rule out malignancy.

584
C: Perform an incisional biopsy.

Explanation: The patient has presented with progressive proptosis and worsening vision in the right eye, attributed to an unknown mass in the right orbit according to a computed tomographic scan. Given her history of breast cancer, assessing for potential metastasis or new primary cancer in the orbit is of crucial importance. While additional imaging may offer more information, it is not likely to clarify the situation definitively. An excisional biopsy might pose unneeded risk due to the mass's size and proximity to the eye. Hence, an incisional biopsy should be carried out promptly to allow for histopathological examination and definitive diagnosis.
B

585
B: Magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomographic imaging of the orbits

Explanation: The patient's clinical features, including ptosis improving with phenylephrine hydrochloride administration and pupil involvement, suggest a sympathomimetic issue such as Horner syndrome or sympathetic chain paresis. Given there is no response to apraclonidine hydrochloride, apraclonidine-resistant ptosis may also be considered. For these reasons, neuroimaging of the orbits and the entire course of the sympathetic chain may be appropriate for further evaluation. Checking myasthenia laboratory findings and commencing a pyridostigmine trial (option A) might not be our first choice as the patient has no suggestive findings such as ocular fatigue or fluctuating ptosis. Müller muscle conjunctival resection (option C) and external levator advancement (option D) are both surgical treatments that may not be a priority before a proper causative diagnosis.

586
B: Impingement of the left sympathetic trunk

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral sweating on the left forehead suggest a dysfunction of the left sympathetic nerve trunk, which regulates sweating and temperature control. The thoracic tumor identified in the CT imaging could exert pressure on or invade this nerve trunk, leading to the observed hyperhidrosis. Options A, C, and D do not provide a direct connection to the observed symptoms and identified lung tumor.

587
B: Electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation.

Explanation: The patient is presenting with persistent and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT), even though she is on antiarrhythmic therapy. An electrophysiological study can help elucidate the underlying cause and mechanism of the VT. If there is a focus of aberrant conduction or a reentrant pathway causing the VT, it may be possible to address this issue through catheter ablation. This could help the patient get better control of her arrhythmia, thus reducing the risk of future episodes of VT and syncope. Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator could be considered, but it mainly serves to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias, not prevent them. Discharge with oral therapy alone doesn't seem sufficient considering the recurrence of VT, her symptoms, and hemodynamic instability.

588
D: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Explanation: The rapid growth, history of weight loss and loss of appetite in the patient suggest a more malignant progression, which is more in line with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is typically accompanied by a history of smoking or drinking, and hemangioma and venous malformations typically do not present with rapid enlargement or weight loss. The mass originating from the tonsils further supports the diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma as lymphoid tissues are primarily found in this area. The patient's age is also consistent with this diagnosis, as Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in individuals of any age. Final diagnosis should always be confirmed with biopsy and histological examination.
C
589
C: Neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis 

Explanation: The specifics of the case highlight a series of escalating neuropathic issues, beginning with flu-like symptoms, evolving to facial paralysis, and later developing into otologic symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus, etc. Given the patient's history of frequented wooded areas and the initial prescription of doxycycline, it's likely that a tick-borne illness may be the root cause. Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is known to present in this fashion and is referred to as Neuroborreliosis when it involves the nervous system. The MRI results show the nerves involved, and while the presentation could be similar to different nerve tumors or idiopathic hearing loss, the breadth of symptoms and history point more towards Neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis.
C
590
A: Macrocystic lymphatic malformation

Explanation: The combination of a midline, non-enhancing, multiloculated sublingual lesion with a submental cutaneous punctum is suggestive of a macrocystic lymphatic malformation, previously referred to as a cystic hygroma. This is a benign congenital malformation of the lymphatic system that occurs when lymphatic vessels fail to connect with the venous system, resulting in dilated, fluid-filled spaces. The mass being bright on T2-weighted images and dark on T1-weighted images emphasizes the water density of the lesion. Given the location and imaging findings, the other differential diagnoses are less likely.
B
591
B: Alternative CFTR functional testing

Explanation: Although the patient has had 3 indeterminate sweat chloride tests and a genetic screening identifying only one CF-causing mutation, the chronic constipation and poor weight gain cannot be dismissed. These can be indicative of CF-related gastrointestinal disease, which can happen without signs of respiratory symptoms. Hence, there is enough evidence to warrant additional CFTR functional testing to rule out an atypical presentation of cystic fibrosis.

A: Initiate topical steroid eyedrop therapy.

Explanation: In this patient with blurry vision and symptoms of ocular inflammation, the findings represent sarcoid-like granulomatous reactions thought to occur as a response to tattoo pigment. This case also illustrates that while such reactions are usually self-limited, some can cause ocular involvement and result in inflammation and increased intraocular pressure, mimicking uveitis and secondary glaucoma. When a patient has ocular inflammation, treatment typically begins with topical corticosteroids in order to reduce inflammation. Therefore, while the tattoo removal and referral to a rheumatologist may be necessary down the line, the initial step in addressing the patient's acute issue would be to reduce the inflammation through steroid eyedrop therapy.

C: Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites 

Explanation: The infant presents with a disseminated, pruritic papulovesicular eruption, a prolonged course, increased fussiness with restlessness at night, contact with an itchy individual, and the presence of burrows, all of which are classic features for scabies. The classic burrow of scabies is a gray to white, slightly raised tunnel in the stratum corneum. Scabies should be considered in any infant with a prolonged, pruritic eruption. Although scabies is a clinical diagnosis usually, atypical presentations (eg, bullous, nodular) may require microscopic confirmation through potassium hydroxide preparation or mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings from burrows showing the mite, eggs, or feces. If the diagnosis is conditional on seeing the mites in the scrapings, a dermatologist could help. Mites are more likely to be found by scraping burrows and papules rather than vesicles or pustules. After the diagnosis, all household contacts should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation. Treatment options include permethrin and ivermectin.

C: Pyoderma vegetans. 

Explanation: Pyoderma vegetans is a rare, benign, chronic skin condition characterized by vegetating pustular plaques. The histopathological findings in this case (pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and dermal neutrophilia with microabscesses and eosinophilia) are consistent with this diagnosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum and blastomycosis often present with ulcerative lesions, but not typically with the vegetating plaques seen in this patient. Halogenoderma, a reaction to halogen exposure, is unlikely given the absence of a history of such exposure and the specific histopathologic findings. Prednisolone, clindamycin, and fluconazole are not typically effective treatments for pyoderma vegetans, which explains why this patient did not improve with prior treatment.

D: Facial morphea

Explanation: The distribution, shape, and consistency of the lesions are characteristic of facial morphea, a form of localized scleroderma that principally affects the skin but may also involve subcutaneous tissues, underlying muscles, and bones. In addition, the absence of previous inflammation, the bilateral symmetry of the lesions, and the scar-like appearance despite the lack of trauma or infection history, are all features indicative of morphea. Other options like primary anetoderma generally present as flaccid bluish patches of skin and are preceded by inflammation; atrophoderma vermiculata is usually characterized by a honeycomb-like appearance; atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis usually presents with sudden onset pitted scars. The patient's presentation and history are not consistent with these conditions.

C: Plasmacytoma. 

Explanation: Given this patient's previous history of multiple myeloma, a solitary plasmacytoma seems a very likely diagnosis. This is a form of monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells - the same type of abnormal process that happens in multiple myeloma. This lesion corresponds to the presence of a solitary mass of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells in the absence of systemic disease, that it could be related to the patient's multiple myeloma. Furthermore, primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma primarily occur in patients with immunodeficiency states (such as HIV) which this patient does not report. Primary Nodular amyloidosis is also a possible diagnosis, but less likely than plasmacytoma given the history of multiple myeloma.

C: Amyand hernia (appendix included within the inguinal hernia sac)

Explanation: The presence of leukocytosis and leukocyturia with positive results for Streptococcus viridians indicates an underlying infection. When taken together with the observed 5 cm × 3 cm mass in the right groin that extends into the scrotum, this suggests an Amyand hernia (a rare form of inguinal hernia in which the appendix is included within the hernia sac). The reduced renal function shown by the renography may be due to the pressure exerted by the hernia or the ongoing infection. Sliding hernia and saphena varix do not typically present with such symptoms, and a communicating hydrocele would not usually be associated with leukocytosis or a reduction in kidney function.

C: Ileo-colic intussusception

Explanation: The patient's signs and symptoms such as sudden abdominal pain, vomiting, and leukocytosis are common features of an ileo-colic intussusception. This condition is when a part of the intestine folds into another segment, causing obstruction. In this clinical scenario, the condition can be substantiated further due to the finding of an edematous small intestinal loop in the left abdomen as demonstrated in the abdominal CT scan. While Crohn's disease (Option A) could present with similar symptoms, the radiologic finding of intussusception would be more consistent with ileo-colic intussusception. Foreign body ingestion (Option B) usually does not show the same radiological signs and symptoms in this case, and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (Option D) is typically associated with more specific symptoms such as weight loss and gastrointestinal bleeding which were not reported in this case.

C: Perform a vitreous tap and administer intravenous ganciclovir treatment

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation and history of recently undergoing orthotopic liver transplant raises suspicion for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis often presents with symptoms such as floaters, flashes of light (photopsias), blurry vision, and visual field defects. The reduced visual acuity, the central scotoma (an area of decreased vision), and the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye may indicate the probable spread of the infection in the optic nerves. Although this patient denies having symptoms typically associated with CMV retinitis, it is important to consider the diagnosis. The detection of CMV DNA in the vitreous fluid can confirm the presence of the infection, and treatment should be initiated with intravenous ganciclovir.

C: Referral for cardiac biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient's recent history of abnormal electrocardiogram and urgent pacemaker implantation, in concert with the choroidal infiltrate of unknown cause, could suggest an underlying systemic disease. Because no evidence of an infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic process has been found to explain these findings, a cardiac biopsy could potentially identify an undetected systemic disease such as cardiac sarcoidosis (a rare disorder in which clusters of white blood cells, called granulomas, form in the tissue of the heart). Given the seriousness of the condition and potential implications for management, exploratory testing such as cardiac biopsy is warranted despite the comprehensive negative results so far.

B: Order a computed tomographic scan of the orbits

Explanation: The patient has presenting symptoms indicative of bilateral orbital involvement such as proptosis, chemosis, limited extraocular motility, and intraocular signs including chorioretinal folds. Given these clinical features, the suspected diagnosis is infiltrative orbital process. A CT scan of the orbits should be done first, to assess for any space-occupying lesions, evaluate soft tissues, bony structures, and the orbital apex. While options like an orbital biopsy or specialist consultation might be steps for further diagnosis or treatment, they would typically follow after initial imaging studies. The option of performing an emergency canthotomy and cantholysis would usually be considered in cases of acute orbital compartment syndrome, which doesn't exactly fit this patient's presenting symptoms. The feasibility of an appropriately targeted biopsy or consultation will be much clearer after imaging. Therefore, ordering a computed tomographic scan of the orbits (option B) is the most appropriate immediate next step.

B: Orbitotomy with biopsy 

Explanation: The patient’s decreasing ocular motility and progressive, painful proptosis in the context of negative infectious and autoimmune workup suggest an infiltrative orbital process such as lymphoma, metastasis, granulomatous inflammation, or infiltrative myositis. Given the severity of symptoms and the progressive nature of her disease, definitive diagnosis should be sought via surgical biopsy to guide targeted therapy. Even though systemic corticosteroids may mimic the effect of immune suppression achieved with targeted therapy, definitive diagnosis should not be delayed. Empiric use of corticosteroids without obtaining a definitive diagnosis may alter biopsy results, complicate the clinical picture, or delay definitive therapy. External beam radiotherapy and intravenous antibiotic therapy is not recommended without definitive diagnosis.

B: Recommend continued blood glucose control and consider intravitreal anti–VEGF injection or focal laser treatment if the macular edema persists.

Explanation: The clinical picture and the findings from the fundus examination and the optical coherence tomography indicate that the patient has developed retinopathy that is most likely secondary to her diabetes. Diabetes is known to cause microvascular complications that lead to retinopathy, and the presence of retinal exudates, hemorrhages, and edema are all typical features of diabetic retinopathy. Her history of a well-controlled hypertension and the absence of any indication that her cancer treatment could have caused these changes also point in this direction. Thus, continuing her blood glucose control efforts is crucial, while intravitreal anti–VEGF injections or focal laser treatment can also be considered if the macular edema persists, as these treatments have shown effectiveness for diabetic macular edema.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits

Explanation: This patient’s fluctuating eye swelling and redness, episcleral venous engorgement, elevated intraocular pressure, and abduction deficit is reminiscent of carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF), which typically result from trauma or spontaneous rupture of intracavernous aneurysms. The patient has evidence of arterialization of the episcleral vessels, diplopia from cranial nerve VI, which traverses the cavernous sinus, elevated intraocular pressure, and tinnitus. Therefore, urgent imaging, in the form of a CTA head and neck or MRI/MRA brain and orbits, is necessary. If a diagnosis of CCF is confirmed, urgent neurosurgical intervention could be warranted. Hence, option C is the most appropriate next step in this patient care, the MRI will provide detailed images of the brain and orbits, which can aid in confirming the diagnosis.

C: Perform head/maxillofacial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation: Based on the clinical history and findings, this patient has persistent vitritis in the left eye. While infections like syphilis and tuberculosis could present with vitritis, these were ruled out with negative testing. There is also no systemic symptoms or laboratory evidence to suggest an autoimmune etiology. Therefore, option B (Start topical or systemic steroids) should be not be an immediate choice, as there is no defined inflammatory entity or infection to treat at this time. Option A (Observe) may not be appropriate because of the risk of irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Option D (Perform vitreous biopsy) is invasive and is generally saved for cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain after less invasive approaches. With persistent left-sided sinus and jaw pain present prior to the onset of ocular symptoms, imaging of the head/maxillofacial area should be performed (Option C) to evaluate for causes like sino-orbital infection or inflammation that could present with blurred vision and irritation in the eye.

606
C: Lichenoid drug reaction 

Explanation: The patient's history of receiving pembrolizumab, a drug with reports of causing lichenoid drug reactions, and the presence of the characteristic hyperpigmented papules and plaques with violaceous borders are pointers towards a lichenoid drug reaction. The fact that the pattern of lesions was identical to a previous syphilitic reaction might suggest secondary syphilis, but his recent treatment with penicillin makes that less likely. Lichen planus is less likely due to the patient's ongoing medication, and Janeway lesions are inconsistent with the given dermatological findings. Thus, considering his clinical presentation and history, a lichenoid drug reaction due to pembrolizumab is most likely. Further biopsy samples and evaluations can confirm the diagnosis. It is important to remember that although lichenoid drug reactions can manifest similarly to lichen planus , the cause, progression, and treatment may differ significantly.

D: Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study.

Explanation: This case is suggestive of right-to-left cardiac shunting as a potential cause of the brain abscess, which can occur in patients with congenital heart disease like ASD and VSD. This can allow venous blood, along with any bacteria present, to bypass the pulmonary filter and directly enter systemic circulation, potentially causing a brain abscess. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study is a noninvasive, reliable, and readily available tool to identify a cardiac shunt by detecting microbubbles in the left heart structures after injected into the vein.

The answer would be speculative as it requires professional medical knowledge to provide an accurate and precise response, which as an AI, I don't posses. Nevertheless, the symptoms described in the case usually point towards a likely diagnosis of option A: Squamous cell carcinoma, which could align with the patient's history of alcoholism and Hepatitis C, both of which greatly increase the risk for developing this particular type of cancer. However, a definitive diagnosis should be confirmed by a medical professional, taking into consideration the medical history, CT results, and post-operative pathology.

609
C: Primary middle ear meningioma

Explanation: 
The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of Primary Middle Ear Meningioma (PMEM). The presence of an indolent mass occupying the middle ear and eustachian tube, its enlarging nature with progressive lack of response to Valsalva maneuver, and absence of pulsatility observed during physical examination are all strong indicators of PMEM. This is supported by the histopathological finding of spindled stroma, which is typical of meningiomas, and the lesion's positivity for antiepithelial membrane antigen and somatostatin receptor 2A, immunohistochemical markers that are often expressed in meningiomas. Additionally, CT and MRI findings demonstrating an enhancing or noncontrast middle ear mass with possible extension into peritubal spaces, also suggest a nonvascular, slowly-growing tumor consistent with PMEM.
C
610
B: Hairy polyp

Explanation: The presence of a nasal mass in a neonate that obstructs one nasal passage suggests a congenital midline nasal mass. The differential diagnosis includes dermoid cyst (mature teratoma), glioma, encephalocele, and hairy polyp. The lack of intracranial extension and drainage rules out encephalocele and glioma. Additionally, dermoid cysts (mature teratomas) are usually located in the midline and have a more complex internal structure secondary to ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal elements. Hairy polyps, also known as teratoid tumors, typically present as unilateral nasal masses, especially in female neonates. These lesions commonly obstruct the nasal cavity and are frequently covered with hair. The appearance of a nasal mass with a fatty component on MR imaging is suggestive of a hairy polyp. Overall, the clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest a diagnosis of a hairy polyp.
B
611
C: Xeroderma pigmentosum

Explanation: The patient's early onset of skin malignancies and scaly, warty skin lesions that are exclusive to sun-exposed skin, plus the fact that Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is recessive characteristic, suggest XP as the most probable diagnosis. Intriguingly, although the parents were first cousins (which increases the chance of recessive genetic disorders like XP), no other family members had similar skin presentations, which suggests the likely presence of a de novo mutation in this patient. XP is a rare, heritable disorder marked by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. It is characterized by high pancancer susceptibility (skin and eyes in particular), neurologic problems, and other symptoms. The likely result of this condition is photodamage that results in a high incidence of skin malignancies at a young age. Furthermore, other diagnoses such as Trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome often include neurologic problems, which this child does not have, and Actinic keratosis usually presents in older patients and has a distinct presentation than described.
C
612
C: The serum vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) level is supportive of a diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Explanation: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare cystic lung disease that predominantly affects women and can be sporadic or associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Typically, LAM involves multiple thin-walled cysts throughout the lungs, as seen in this patient's CT scan. While other diseases such as Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis can also involve cysts in the lungs, they typically present with other changes not evident in this case. Importantly, elevated serum VEGF-D levels (>800 pg/mL) are suggestive of LAM, according to guidelines from the European Respiratory Society. Considering the patient's clinical presentation and elevated VEGF-D level, LAM is the most probable diagnosis, thus requiring no need for a lung biopsy.

613
C: Order serologic testing for parvovirus

Explanation: The patient's exposure history, malar rash, and symmetric polyarthritis suggest parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 infection is a common cause of viral arthritis, and acute infection (but not chronic infection) can trigger symptoms of joint inflammation. In adults, parvovirus B19 infection characteristically affects the small joints of the hands and feet symmetrically, which can mimic rheumatoid arthritis. However, unlike rheumatoid arthritis, acute parvovirus arthritis resolves spontaneously within weeks. Other symptoms of parvovirus infection include malaise, fever, and a distinctive rash, the latter occurring in approximately one-third of infected adults. The rash is often facial and mimics the malar rash of lupus, but unlike the rash of lupus, the parvovirus rash often extends to the extremities and trunk. In this patient, the exposure risk (ie, contact with two family members with rashes and a febrile illness) and the onset, pattern, and potential for recovery of arthritis are most consistent with parvovirus B19. Therefore, serologic testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Other laboratory abnormalities can include reticulocytopenia and anemia, whereas the white blood cell count, platelet count, and inflammatory markers remain normal.

C: Order serologic testing for parvovirus

Explanation: This patient with polyarticular arthritis and a malar rash has findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the involvement of multiple family members with similar symptoms raises suspicion for a postinfectious cause. Parvovirus B19 most commonly causes a febrile illness with a rash (fifth disease or erythema infectiosum) in children but can also result in a postinfectious syndrome in adults featuring arthralgias or arthritis that mimics rheumatoid arthritis or SLE, including a positive antinuclear antibodies result. Parvovirus arthritis commences abruptly, most frequently affects the small joints of the hands and feet, and can be associated with extreme joint tenderness and swelling that causes limited range of motion. Patients are typically afebrile. Parvovirus B19 can therefore be suspected in patients with an acute or subacute arthritis that occurs following contact with individuals having a rash illness. The arthritis generally resolves within a few weeks but can occasionally persist for months. Management is geared towards relief of symptoms, for example with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

C: Order serologic testing for parvovirus

Explanation: The correct answer is to order serologic testing for parvovirus. The patient's findings of a migratory polyarthritis and rash after exposure to ill family members are most compatible with parvovirus B19 infection, an erythrovirus. This virus is highly contagious and primarily spread via respiratory droplets, explaining the patient's exposure through her ill grandchildren. It is best known for causing "fifth disease" or "slapped cheek syndrome" in children, which manifests as a slapped-cheek facial rash, lacy reticular body rash, and mild nonspecific systemic symptoms. Adult patients typically do not manifest with rash or fever, but can develop acute symmetric polyarthropathy, as is seen in the patient's case. This generally involves the small joints of the hands and feet and can be migratory in nature. The arthritis typically resolves spontaneously within weeks but can persist and mimic rheumatoid arthritis in some cases. As is the case in our patient, erythrovirus can also cause a low-grade hemolytic anemia, especially in individuals with diseases that shorten the red blood cell lifespan.

A: Test results indicate presence of IgG4-related disease.

Explanation: There's an indication of the presence of IgG4-related disease in the patient. This is a rare, immune-mediated condition that can affect multiple organs and is characterized by tumefactive lesions, dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells and often, but not always, increased serum IgG4 concentration. The patient's symptoms and results, including the diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and the high IgG4 levels, are consistent with findings in this disease. Importantly, the patient's fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas showed no malignancy, which would tend to rule out pancreatic cancer, locally invasive pancreatic lymphoma, and viral hepatitis. The obstruction of the left ureter causing hydronephrosis further supports the IgG4-related disease diagnosis.

B: Mucormycosis 

Explanation: The presentation of a rapidly enlarging and necrotic palatal lesion in an immunocompromised patient should raise suspicion for an invasive fungal infection, particularly mucormycosis, which predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, especially those with hematologic malignancies and neutropenia. The classic presentation of mucormycosis is palatal necrosis, as seen in this patient. In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma (Option A) usually causes a slow-growing mass with potential ulceration, Aspergillosis (Option C) usually presents with symptoms of sinusitis and does not typically cause palatal necrosis, and myeloid sarcoma (Option D), although possible due to patient's AML, does not typically cause palatal necrosis or such rapid symptom progression. Grocott methenamine silver stain from biopsy (seen in option C) is typically positive in patients with mucormycosis, indicating it to be the likely diagnosis.

C: Clear cell papulosis 

Explanation: Clear cell papulosis is a rare condition characterized by multiple, asymptomatic, hypopigmented macules mainly on the abdomen and pubic area. These are congenital and are composed of clear cells within the epidermis with a pale cytoplasm characteristic of this condition. This case clearly demonstrates these features: histopathological examination revealing mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis and the cells being larger than neighboring keratinocytes. Tinea versicolor was less likely because the KOH test was negative for hyphae, vitiligo typically show accentuation with Wood light examination which is not present in this case, and idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis typically occurs in older individuals and lesions are generally found on sun-exposed areas, which doesn't align with the case.

B: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis

Explanation: The clinical history, presentation, and examination findings are consistent with Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a rare EBV–positive B-cell proliferation often coexisting with an atypical T-cell infiltrate. It exhibits a predilection for extranodal sites, includes lungs (as found in this case with multifocal pneumonia), skin, and central nervous system. Cutaneous symptoms could manifest as necrotic nodules and papules, which align with the patient's symptoms.

618
B: Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis 

Explanation: 

The dilation of the stomach and duodenum along with the decompressed, thickened distal small bowel without a clear transition point on the abdominal computed tomography scan is suggestive of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Additionally, nonoperative management was unsuccessful and the patient was dependent on total parenteral nutrition, which is commonly associated with this condition. Although the patient had a positive test for TB exposure, there were no definitive signs of abdominal tuberculosis such as caseating granulomas or other tuberculosis-specific features. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is less likely given the patient's history and clinical picture. Similarly, adhesive small bowel obstruction was previously treated but provided only temporary relief, making it less likely as well. Hence, the diagnosis of Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis seems more probable in this case considering all clinical and imaging findings.

D: Infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula.

Explanation: This particular patient's symptoms indicate a possible presence of an infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula. Unexplained weight loss, anorexia, back pain along with the history of aortic aneurysm repair and recent dental abscess (which could have potentially introduced infection into the bloodstream) may contribute to this diagnosis. The heart rate and leukocyte level are elevated, and the C-reactive protein level (which is usually raised in cases of inflammation and infection) is also very high. All of these findings are suggestive of a high-grade systemic inflammatory response, which can be caused by an infected graft. The individual's poor dental hygiene and the recent tooth extraction due to an abscess might have served as a source of infection for the graft. Additionally, the postthrombotic syndrome found in the lower extremity could be a byproduct of a disseminated infection. While carcinoma or ulcer could also present with similar initial symptoms like weight loss and anorexia, the later signs such as sepsis and leukocytosis are less common in these conditions but are more common and consistent with an infected graft.

C: Check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels

Explanation: The descriptions and images from the patient's examination suggest the differential diagnosis of sclerochoroidal calcifications. These are typically benign lesions found in older individuals and are often incidentally identified in the absence of visual symptoms. The causative factors can include any conditions leading to hypercalcemia, such as hyperparathyroidism, which is why it is necessary to check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels (Option C). A biopsy (Option A) might be necessary if metastatic disease is suspected, but given the rare incidence of choroidal metastasis from parathyroid carcinoma, it might not be the first step here. Although inflammation is reportedly associated with calcification growth and leakage, the initiation of systemic corticosteroids (Option B) should be considered only after ruling out neoplasm because it can mask malignancies, delay an appropriate treatment and cause side effects. Plaque brachytherapy (Option D) is typically reserved for choroidal melanoma, which does not seem to be the primary suspicion here.

621
C: Order mitochondrial genetic testing

Explanation: Given this patient’s history of bilateral, sequentially progressive visual loss, photophobia, and color vision deficits, with cecocentral scotomata on perimetry, the leading diagnostic consideration is mitochondrial optic neuropathy, particularly Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON typically presents in young adult males, but onset in individuals as old as this patient has been reported. Associated features like bilateral central or cecocentral scotomas, dyschromatopsia, and initially normal appearing optic nerve heads followed then by optic atrophy, all fit with this diagnosis, regardless of the patient's age or gender. Mitochondrial genetic testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. Other options are less likely. While analyzing the retinal layers by SD-OCT segmentation (A) could be done, findings on the OCT would be nonspecific before the development of optic disc atrophy. Assessing potential nocturnal systemic hypotension, sleep apnea, and other cardiovascular risk factors (B) may be considered in cases of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), but temporal disc pallor and other associations like photophobia which are typical for LHON are unusual for NAION. Lastly, toxic and nutritional neuropathies (D) usually cause slowly progressive, bilateral, symmetrical loss of vision, but these rarely present with scotomas or significant dyschromatopsia.

B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and examination findings are suggestive of a pituitary or genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems. Features like short stature, alopecia, diabetes insipidus, and optic atrophy collectively suggest the diagnosis of a multisystem disorder, possibly due to the involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This is suggested by the presence of diabetes insipidus, hypochondroplasia, and alopecia. An endocrine evaluation with tests for thyrotropin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone, and testosterone would be crucial in furthering the diagnosis. Therefore, answer B: 'Order a hormone profile (thyrotropin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone, and testosterone) and consult endocrinology' is a logical next step to clarify the underlying condition. Additionally, consulting endocrinology would also provide important insights and perspectives on the case guided by their expertise.

A: Perform genetic testing

Explanation: This patient’s fundus examination, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and electroretinogram findings are characteristic of genetic retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by progressive peripheral vision loss, night blindness, and eventually central vision loss. Diagnostic tests such as genetic testing would help identify the specific gene mutation causing the condition, which could be beneficial for family counseling and, in some cases, for selection to gene therapy clinical trials.

C: Another MRI scan of the orbit.

Explanation: The changes in the patient's symptomatology over time with progressing vision loss and a confirmed relative afferent pupillary defect suggests the presence of an evolving disease process which is not yet identified. Given this scenario, although all of the provided options may be relevant to some degree, the most appropriate next step would be to repeat the MRI scan of the orbit. This would help to monitor for any potential changes or new findings that may provide an explanation for the patient’s symptoms. It's possible that the initial MRI scan did not show the disease if it was in its earliest stages. Modifications to risk factors and treatments such as corticosteroids would typically come at a later stage, following a definitive diagnosis, while a lumbar puncture could also be considered but might not be the first choice in the absence of other suggestive signs or symptoms. Therefore, another MRI scan (Option C) is the logical next step.

D

Explanation: The patient's history and examination are notable for bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR). It is a condition where fluid accumulates under the retina, distorting vision. Based on the information provided, there doesn't seem to be an immediate need for further testing for other conditions such as syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis as suggested in option A. Option B is not relevant as there is no mention of symptoms requiring a complete blood cell count. The imaging of the brain and orbits (option C) is also unnecessary given the diagnosed condition. So, option D where the patient is observed and offered photodynamic therapy if the subretinal fluid persists for 3 months would be the most suitable approach. Photodynamic therapy is used in the treatment of bilateral CSR and is generally administered if the fluid does not resolve itself over time.
B: Follicular lymphoma. 

Explanation: The presentation of a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion with associated pruritus, significant weight loss, persisting abdominal pain, and cervical lymphadenopathy, as well as laboratory findings of mild anemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, strongly suggest a systemic process like a lymphoma. Although mycosis fungoides, lichen planus, and marginal zone lymphoma are also possibilities, Follicular lymphoma is a more likely diagnosis given the presence of systemic symptoms, the relatively rapid growth of the lesion, and the past history of abdominal adenopathy. Furthermore, it is one of the most common types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults and can present as a skin lesion in extranodal sites which could explain the scalp lesion. Therefore, given the clinical scenario, and the history, the potential answer would be Follicular lymphoma. Nonetheless, the ultimate diagnosis would require a pathology report from the biopsy.

C: Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified.

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with inferior ST-segment elevation on ECG, an ongoing coronary ischemia should be suspected. This would imply that one of the coronary arteries is blocked, resulting in a reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. The most likely source for such an event related to inferior STEMI would be the right coronary artery or the left circumflex artery. Therefore, the culprit artery needs immediate identification and treatment rather than focusing on the left anterior descending artery. It's crucial to treat the blockage causing the current symptoms, thus, coronary intervention in the form of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be immediately considered once the culprit artery is identified.

C: Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified.

Explanation: Given the presentation of the 71-year-old patient with central chest pain, breathlessness, tachycardia, hypotension, and an ECG showing inferior ST-segment elevation, the patient is experiencing an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, typically associated with right coronary artery occlusion. Therefore, pursuing the culprit coronary artery not yet identified, likely the right coronary artery, should be the immediate next step rather than focusing solely on the left anterior descending artery. Immediate identification of the occluded artery and subsequent appropriate revascularization procedures are crucial in managing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to minimize myocardial damage.

C: Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified. 

Explanation: The patient had unstable vital signs, and his ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), suggesting an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). Inferior wall MI's are typically associated with right coronary artery occlusions (and, in some cases, left circumflex artery occlusions), not the left anterior descending artery. It is thus crucial to identify and treat the culprit artery to re-establish blood flow, minimize myocardial damage, and improve the patient's prognosis. While correcting the left anterior descending artery plaque may be considered, it does not appear to be the immediate cause of the patient's acute presentation. Similarly, fractional flow reserve and computed tomography angiography, while useful in specific clinical scenarios, may not be appropriate or feasible given the patient's emergency condition.

D: Perform an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration.

Explanation: This case is highly suggestive of a malignant neoplasm given the patient's weight loss, malaise, multiple liver masses, a pancreatic mass, and significantly elevated AFP level. The initial step in the evaluation of this patient should be definitive tissue diagnosis. Starting treatment with systemic chemotherapy (option A) or targeted therapy (option B) without histological or cytological confirmation is not appropriate. 18F-FDG PET scan (option C) is not typically used as a first-line imaging study in the evaluation of a pancreatic mass or a suspected primary hepatic malignancy, being of most value in identifying unrecognized metastatic disease in patients with a known diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, an endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (option D) is the best next step for obtaining a tissue diagnosis from the pancreatic mass, given the high sensitivity and specificity of this test.

B: Amyloidosis

Explanation: The symptoms, imaging characteristics, and the histopathologic findings suggest the diagnosis of tracheobronchial amyloidosis. This condition is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the trachea and bronchi which may cause problems like wheezing and dyspnea. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying apple-green birefringence under polarized light when stained with Congo red, which is characteristic of amyloid. This case can be considered a rare presentation because of the extent of tracheal involvement and aggressive appearing mass-like lesions. Although MTC may also produce amyloid, the absence of any suspicious adenopathy, the lack of accurate CT findings, normal vocal cord mobility, and the patient's denial of dysphagia make thyroid cancer less likely.
C
630
C: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Explanation: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism, nasosinusitis symptoms, acute vision loss, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level suggest a systemic inflammation process. The imaging results show extension of abnormal appearing tissue leading to the destruction of the sinus walls and skull base which further suggests a granulomatous disease. Finally, the presence of multinucleated giant cells, necrosis, and inflammatory cells invading vessel walls in the biopsy results is characteristic of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, throat, and kidneys. The absence of fungal elements and cellular dysplasia in the biopsy rules out invasive fungal sinusitis and malignant diseases such as Lymphoma and Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma.
C
631
B: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis

Explanation: The symptoms described such as nasal swelling, pain, drainage, and difficulty swallowing, combined with the CT and MRI findings of marked soft tissue swelling and enhancement along the nasal cavity with no intracranial or intraorbital disease extension, suggest an inflammatory process. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis are both chronic inflammatory conditions that can cause these symptoms. Both conditions can involve the respiratory system, and in the case of Wegner granulomatosis, the nose is often the initial site of involvement. Necrotizing fasciitis and squamous cell carcinoma would likely present with more localized symptoms and wouldn't typically involve the respiratory system. Extranodal T-cell lymphoma could theoretically present in this fashion, but it would be a rare presentation for this type of lymphoma. Therefore, the best answer is B: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis.
A
632
D: Myositis ossificans. 

Explanation: The key features of this case including the clinical history of a progressing, tender, and firm neck mass, with ultrasound and CT imaging demonstrating an ossified non-aggressive mass separate from the underlying bone, are most consistent with myositis ossificans, which can occur after trauma. It is a benign condition characterized by heterotopic ossification (formation of bone in the soft tissue where bone normally does not exist). While osteochondroma, osteoid osteoma, and osteosarcoma can present as ossified masses, they are typically associated with underlying bone or have certain aggressive imaging features, and would not fit this clinical and radiological picture as closely as myositis ossificans. Furthermore, the history of the mass developing following a motor vehicle accident further supports this diagnosis, given that myositis ossificans is often associated with a history of trauma.
D
633
B: Obtain an HIV immunoassay

Explanation: The patient's clinical picture of fever, rash, and systemic involvement, including abnormal liver function tests, suggests a systemic viral infection. HIV should be considered given the symptoms of a mononucleosis-like syndrome, especially fever, rash, and sore throat. Acute HIV infection is characterized by a wide range of nonspecific symptoms, and often includes a maculopapular rash and liver involvement. Therefore, obtaining an HIV immunoassay is critical in this setting. Furthermore, the fact that the patient resides in a region where sexually transmitted infections are common also increases the likelihood of HIV infection. Other options do not carry the same level of urgency or diagnostic value: administering steroids could potentially worsen a systemic infection; liver biopsy is invasive and not immediately indicated; and negative-pressure isolation is only necessary if an airborne infectious disease such as tuberculosis or measles is suspected.

634
D: The patient has warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 

Explanation: In this case, the anemia, reticulocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia are all consistent with a hemolytic process. In addition, the positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT, also known as the direct Coombs test) with polyspecific reagent and anti-IgG, but negative with anti-C3d, is suggestive of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA). This condition can present as a primary disorder or secondary to malignancy, autoimmune disease, or drug exposure. Approximately 7% to 10% of patients with CLL develop wAIHA during their course. Hence, in light of this patient's history of CLL, a diagnosis of wAIHA is strongly suggested. The other suggested conditions do not align as well with the laboratory results and clinical picture.

635
B: Continue medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM), also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. TCM is typically provoked by physical or emotional stress and is characterized by transient apical ballooning and akinesia of the left ventricle. Symptoms usually mimic those of an acute coronary syndrome, and patients can present with chest pain or dyspnea. On ECG, ST-segment elevation or depression and T-wave inversions can be seen, in addition to minor troponin elevation. The definitive diagnosis is made by coronary angiography, which will show no obstructive lesion, and ventriculography, which may show apical ballooning.

In this case, management involves supportive care, with β-blockers and ACE inhibitors often used. Symptoms usually resolve over weeks to months. There is usually no indication for reperfusion therapy because coronary arteries are generally patent, and there is no benefit to long-term antiplatelet therapy unless there is another indication. Angiographic resolution occurs over 2 to 4 weeks in most patients, and full recovery is expected. Therefore, continuing medical therapy is the most appropriate management.

636
B

Explanation: The patient's low blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased urine output and pneumonia symptoms, followed by respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation, indicate a severe systemic infection, or sepsis. The sudden drop in urine output in combination with the laboratory findings suggest the development of acute kidney injury, most likely due to sepsis. Therefore, answer B, stating that the patient has acute kidney injury related to sepsis, is the most appropriate response. The changes in GFR or presence of prerenal azotemia can't be confirmed from the information provided, and while there is an observed change in serum creatinine, it doesn't provide a complete picture of the kidney function on its own.

B: Inverse lichen planus

Explanation: The clinical and histologic findings, including violaceous annular patches and band-like lymphocytic infiltrate obscuring the dermal-epidermal junction, are consistent with inverse lichen planus. This condition often presents with violaceous, pruritic, well-demarcated papules or patches in the intertriginous areas. The differential diagnosis for violaceous patches or plaques in the axilla includes familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease), fixed drug eruption, and erythrasma. However, these conditions show significant clinical and histopathologic differences making inverse lichen planus the most probable diagnosis.

C: Oral hairy leukoplakia. 

Explanation: The patient's history and presentation, along with the histologic findings, are consistent with oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL). OHL is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related oral lesion that often presents as an asymptomatic, non-removable white patch on the lateral tongue. Histologically, it is characterized by hyperkeratotic, acanthotic stratified squamous epithelium with presence of balloon cells throughout the stratum spinosum and superficial layer. A distinctive microscopic finding in OHL includes peripheral chromatin margination, also described as chromatin beading. Although OHL often occurs in immunosuppressed individuals, particularly those with HIV, it can also develop in individuals with no reported immunosuppression. The absence of symptoms, the lesion's specific location and appearance, and the patient's lack of reported HIV or other major immunosuppression justify ruling out diagnoses of oral frictional keratosis, oral lichen planus, and oral squamous cell carcinoma.

B: Subungual melanoma

Explanation: Subungual melanoma is a type of melanoma that develops under the nail. It often presents as a pigmented longitudinal streak on the nail as seen in the patient. It's also often associated with nail thickening or distortion, as noted during the clinical examination in the case presented. The melanoma typically starts in the nail matrix, which can cause the pigmentation to extend to the proximal nail fold, a sign known as Hutchinson's sign, which was observed in this patient. The subungual location, longitudinal growth, Hutchinson's sign, and result of the biopsy make a diagnosis of Subungual melanoma most likely. It's worth mentioning that subungual melanoma makes up approximately 50% of melanomas in people with darker skin tones. The patient's lack of other signs/symptoms (like pain or fever) and the slow, progressive growth also align with this type of melanoma. It's important to diagnose it as early as possible due to the serious nature of melanoma.

C: Clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention. 

Explanation: The young man is presenting with sub-threshold symptoms, as described in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. It didn't reveal any specific mental disorder, which means he may not respond well to specific treatments like low-dose atypical antipsychotics or fish oil supplementation as these are generally used for diagnosed mental conditions. Discharging the patient to the general practitioner without any clinical recommendations may not be beneficial as his condition could worsen without any form of assistance. Therefore, the best option seems to be a clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention. This would involve monitoring the patient's mental status regularly and intervening with supportive and psycho-educational measures if necessary, to prevent the emergence of a full-blown disorder. This approach aligns with the early detection and preventive approach for mental disorders, especially in the adolescent population where full maturation of the brain and the associated mental processes are still in progress.

C: Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay

Explanation: The clinical presentation of progressive gait abnormalities and ataxia, along with signs of distal sensory loss, are indicative of a spinocerebellar syndrome. The unusual fundus finding of markedly thickened retinal nerve fiber layer is a sign of Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), a rare neurodegenerative disorder found most often in regions of Quebec, Canada, but is increasingly being recognized worldwide. This genetic disorder predominantly affects the cerebellum, leading to poor muscle coordination and balance issues, which could explain the patient's symptoms. Although Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and Friedreich ataxia can present with visual disturbances or gait abnormalities, they would not typically present with the specific fundus findings observed in this patient. Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia could possibly present with gait difficulties and spasticity, but the retinal changes are not characteristic of this condition. Hence, given the unique combination of gait difficulties and fundus findings, ARSACS seems the most likely diagnosis.

C: Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia)

Explanation: The symptoms described are indicative of a superior lumbar hernia, also known as a Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia. These occur when there's a weakness in the posterior abdominal wall, typically in an anatomic defect known as the Grynfeltt-Lesshaft triangle. This triangle is bound by the 12th rib superiorly, the internal oblique laterally, and the erector spinae medially. Hernias in this location are rare and can be misdiagnosed, but the patient's history of multiple surgical procedures and the presence of the bulge that changes with posture and coughing are classic signs of a hernia. In addition, the CT scan would have provided further clarity on its exact location and size. Other options like lipoma, muscular atrophy (pseudohernia), or postoperative seroma are less likely given the symptoms and findings on examination.

C: Thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of neck and shoulder pain, paresthesia and pain radiating down his right arm, and the physical exam finding of cervical spine tenderness without any noted weakness or sensory deficits could be indicative of a thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms. The tracheal deviation noted in the plain radiograph also suggests a mass effect from a large thyroid gland, which is consistent with a thyroid goiter. Metastatic lung cancer and vertebral fractures usually present with a history of weight loss, cough, or trauma, respectively, which the patient does not have. Also, there is no evidence of any mass, lymphadenopathy or other signs indicative of malignancy in the patient's presentation or in the imaging provided.

C: Obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agents 

Explanation: The woman's symptoms of rapid vision loss, along with vitritis, macular striae, vascular sheathing, and retinal whitening point towards a severe inflammatory response. The nature of the lesions and their progression suggest a viral infection - particularly from members of the herpes family. The treatment with oral antiviral and corticosteroid medications that was started after the initial examination and the worsening of the symptoms over the week despite this treatment also support a viral cause. Getting an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction tests would help in the definitive diagnosis of the viral agent responsible, and further specific antiviral treatment can then be given.

645
C: Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy

Explanation: Given the patient's history of successful response to oral prednisone, longer-term condition, and the dissimilarity from classic presentation of xanthelasma, the clues point to an inflammatory process rather than an infection. Therefore, option A: oral antibiotics may not be beneficial in this case. The imaging does not suggest an urgent need for surgical intervention (option B: surgical debulking). A treatment trial with oral corticosteroids may reduce swelling and inflammation. Concurrent biopsy (option C) would provide essential histopathologic information to confirm the diagnosis. Option D: Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy could be an alternative, but without the histopathologic diagnosis, this approach might be premature. Hence, the most suitable approach would be to start oral corticosteroid treatment and perform a biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. After the histopathologic diagnosis, appropriate long-term therapy (potentially including immunosuppressive agents) could be initiated.

B

Explanation: Considering the patient's condition, the most suitable next step would be to further taper her corticosteroid dosage and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae. The symptoms and complications, like increased trabecular meshwork pigmentation, visible posterior synechiae, and iris irregularities suggest an underlying acute inflammatory response likely due to laser exposure. Although there is intraocular pressure asymmetry, it is mild and there's no acute risk of glaucoma that necessitates urgent peripheral iridotomy. On the other hand, increasing her topical corticosteroid dosage may exacerbate the already increased intraocular pressure. Moreover, AC paracentesis and viral analysis seem unnecessary as there's no evidence suggesting viral etiology. Thus, reducing the inflammation and breaking the adhesions between the iris and the lens using a cycloplegic agent seems to be a more appropriate intervention.
B. Perform gonioscopy 

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests an acute unilateral rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) leading to blurry vision and corneal edema. It is necessary to evaluate the angle anatomy and configuration that may explain the acute increase in IOP, which can be achieved through gonioscopy. It is the most direct and effective way to diagnose primary and secondary forms of glaucoma associated with alterations to the anterior chamber angle, which could be the result following the injury to the eye. The other interventions listed, although important in certain contexts, are not the immediate priority in this case. MR imaging would be useful if the diagnosis involves brain pathology. Miotic agents or peripheral iridotomy would be indicated if the patient were diagnosed with acute angle-closure glaucoma, for which there is currently no definitive evidence.
C: Obtain a complete blood cell count

Explanation: Given his history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation treated with cardiac catheterization and ablation, the dilated retinal veins and facial plethora, the best next step in this situation would be to perform a complete blood cell count. These findings may represent the impact of an elevated blood viscosity or a clotting disorder, hence obtaining a complete blood cell count is a reasonable initial step. Further assessment may include evaluation for systemic conditions such as erythrocytosis or a myeloproliferative disorder, which can lead to thrombosis. A CT scan of the abdomen, ocular massage, or genetic testing for the VHL gene are not immediate next steps based on the presented symptoms.

B: Initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after HLA-A29 laboratory analysis.

Explanation: The patient's condition is suggestive of an atypical white dot syndrome variant. Birdshot chorioretinopathy, which was initially suspected, is often associated with the HLA-A29 haplotype, and typically presents bilaterally with inflammatory spots, concomitant vitritis, and patient-reported symptoms such as blurry vision, floaters, or nyctalopia. However, the unilateral presentation, absence of vitritis, and asymptomatic status of our patient is atypical for such diagnosis. Hence, an HLA-A29 analysis can help confirm or refute the initial suspicion, but given the signs of inflammation visible in OCT findings, initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression can be beneficial in alleviating any inflammatory processes currently affecting the patient and may prevent further progression of the condition. Observation, hematologic workup, or vitreous biopsy may not be necessary or indicated at this point in time.

(A) Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung

Explanation: Given the patient’s smoking history, the histological analysis of the mass, and the immunohistochemical staining results, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the most likely diagnosis. This type of cancer commonly presents with symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, as experienced by this patient.
The histological findings of the tumor cells are characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma, including the presence of keratinization and intercellular bridges. Moreover, the tumor cells tested positive for markers that are typically expressed in squamous cell carcinoma, such as p63 and cytokeratin 5/6.
Conversely, markers that would indicate other types of tumors (i.e., S-100 and Melan A for melanoma, thyroid transcription factor-1 for adenocarcinoma, CD45 for lymphoma, and CD56 for neuroendocrine tumors) were negative. Furthermore, the patient's comprehensive metastases support a diagnosis of advanced lung cancer.
The other answer options, such as carcinoid tumor, primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor, nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma are less likely given the clinical presentation, histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings.
D: Transesophageal echocardiography. 

Explanation: The patient’s ECG and TTE are insufficient to provide a clear diagnosis. While Elevated troponin T levels could indicate a myocardial infarction, it may also be elevated due to the cardiac arrest itself. The irregular pulse could suggest atrial fibrillation, but this is unconfirmed and might not be the primary problem. No clear signs of a pulmonary embolism are currently present. Transesophageal echocardiography (D) can provide a detailed image of the heart’s structure and function, which can help identify the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest. It can better visualize heart valves and left atrial appendage for possible thrombus. A brain CT scan (B) would be needed if there were localizing neurologic signs or if the patient had a history of recent falls or trauma leading up to the event, which is not the case here.

652
B: Laryngeal gout

Explanation: Considering the patient's history of smoking and hyperuricemia, it's more likely the discovered vocal fold mass would be laryngeal gout. Gout is a condition characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in tissues, caused by hyperuricemia. Laryngeal involvement is rare but can occur, often presenting as a submucosal lesion in the vocal folds. The patient's lack of symptoms such as fevers or weight loss reduces the likelihood of tuberculosis or granuloma. Amyloidosis is less likely given the patient's presentation and history. The presence of 'white caseous debris' in the lesion also suggests gout as the correct diagnosis.
B
653
C: Kimura disease

Explanation: 

Kimura disease is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder that typically presents with unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels. It often affects young males, and the most common sites of involvement are the neck, groin, and axillary region. In the patient's case, the presence of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, raised eosinophil count, absence of pain, and resistance to antibiotics all suggest the presence of Kimura disease. While lymphadenopathy may also be found in Hodgkin lymphoma and tubercular lymphadenitis, these are often associated with other systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite, none of which the patient exhibits. On the other hand, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) typically presents with small, red-brown nodules in the skin of the head and neck, characteristics not mentioned in the patient's case. Hence, based on the given information, the best choice is Kimura disease.
C
654
C: Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma

Explanation: The patient's mass, immunohistochemical characteristics and history are most suggestive of a  Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS). FDCS is a rare, slow-growing malignant tumor that originates from follicular dendritic cells, which are found in lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. The immunohistochemical findings support this as well. Specifically, cells of FDCS are typically CD21 and CD23 positive, which is also seen in this case. The other options are less likely because, their typical histologic features and immunoprofile do not match the characteristics seen in this case.
C
655
B: Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis 

Explanation: In light of the discovery of multiple lung nodules of variable sizes, predominantly in the lower lobes and the patient's previous history of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, it is crucial to perform further diagnostic tests to rule out any potential heart-related conditions that could be causing these abnormalities, such as right-sided endocarditis. Although other options could be considered based on the results of these tests, the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that a cardiac issue may be at root, making the echocardiography a logical next step before exploring other treatment options. Thorough imaging studies and analysis would help to define and determine the exact problem, decide the ideal treatment protocol and prevent future complications.

B: Perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve.

Explanation: The symptoms described including hypoesthesia over the lesion, thickening of the ulnar nerve and negative Gram stain and acid-fast bacillary results suggest a possible diagnosis of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. This disease can cause skin lesions and nerve damage and is more common in certain parts of the world such as Bangladesh. Given this, it would be prudent to perform a diagnostic biopsy on the lesion and the nerve, especially considering the failure to respond to previous treatments. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the appropriate treatment can be initiated.

D: The patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage.

Explanation: Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) has greater accuracy for the detection of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis than for milder stages of fibrosis. A liver biopsy is often considered the gold standard for assessing liver fibrosis. Several other noninvasive tests for fibrosis have been developed, but none have completely supplanted liver biopsy when a definitive diagnosis is needed, although they can provide helpful complementary information. Thus, despite the VCTE result for this patient, it would be prudent to confirm the stage of fibrosis through a liver biopsy.

B. The patient has masked uncontrolled hypertension.

Explanation: Masked uncontrolled hypertension is defined as having normal in-office but elevated out-of-office BP measurements in patients on antihypertensive therapy. This can be due to lifestyle factors or physiological conditions which are not present in the clinic but elevate blood pressure outside. In this case, the patient's ambulatory BP monitoring showed high blood pressure during her panic attack and after a high-sodium meal, suggesting that her hypertension is not well controlled outside the clinic. Hence, the option B is the correct interpretation.
D: Sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome)

Explanation: The presentation of the patient's condition indicates Sclerotylosis or Huriez Syndrome. It's a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin abnormalities. The unique presentation of atrophic hyperpigmented patches on the palms, along with the spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, is a typical clinical feature of Huriez syndrome. The gradual spread from palm to wrist and the associated itchiness and burning sensation match this syndrome's features, as well. The lack of plantar surfaces involvement and absence of similar conditions in family history are also not uncommon in Sclerotylosis. In contrast, Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma usually have slightly varying presentations and could involve other areas of the body. Final confirmation would come from the histopathologic finding shown by biopsy specimens.

A: Trichodysplasia spinulosa

Explanation: 
Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare skin condition that commonly affects immunosuppressed individuals, particularly those who have received organ transplants. The typical presentation includes the development of follicular keratotic spines, most commonly on the face. The disease is caused by reactivation or new infection of the Trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus. Immunohistochemical staining is typically positive for the virus, as depicted in this case. The affected cells show abnormal enlargement with irregular trichohyaline granules, which is consistent with the histologic findings disclosed in this case. On the contrary, Lichen spinulosus, Demodecosis, and Disseminated keratosis pilaris do not typically present in this manner and are not associated with immunosuppression.

B: Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans
Explanation: 
Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans (EPSR) is a very rare type of figurate erythema characterized by recurrent, large, semicircular erythematous patches that expand peripherally, with a distinct papular, often vesicular border. The eruption occurs mainly on the trunk, mostly in the warmer months and improves during autumn or winter. Given the patient's history of seasonal recurrences and the clinical features of the skin lesions, this would suggest a diagnosis of EPSR. 

Importantly, the other options include granuloma annulare and deep erythema annulare centrifugum, which are both characterized by raised, red lesions that often have a ring-shaped pattern. Erythema chronicum migrans is the skin rash seen in early Lyme disease, a condition often associated with a history of tick bite and a smaller size typically less than 5 cm in diameter. Considering no history of tick bite and different clinical features, these options seem less likely.

662
D: Cobalt toxicity. 

Explanation: 
Cobalt toxicity could be the correct diagnosis in this case due to several evidence. Firstly, his history of hip arthroplasty with revisions can lead to cobalt toxicity, as cobalt is commonly used in orthopedic prostheses. The MRI findings with heterotopic ossification and pseudotumor of metallosis are suggestive of metal deposits from the hip prostheses, which might suggest a source of cobalt. Also, this is further reinforced by the patient's new onset of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, which can be secondary to cobalt toxicity.
Secondly, bilateral loss of vision, hearing, and peripheral neuropathy, as presented in this patient, were reported in previously diagnosed cases of cobalt toxicity. Although the other three differential diagnoses can present with similar symptoms, cobalt toxicity fits this patient's presentation more accurately considering his specific history and clinical course. Lastly, the temporal association between his hip surgery and the onset of these symptoms also further points towards a diagnosis of cobalt toxicity.

B: Colonic ischemia

Explanation: The clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory findings of this patient suggest a diagnosis of colonic ischemia. The findings of abdominal pain, especially in the right lower quadrant, along with presence of melena are suggestive of bowel ischemia. The high leukocyte count indicates infection, which can also be due to ischemia leading to translocation of bacteria. The computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum further supports the diagnosis of colonic ischemia. Additionally, the absence of signs of other possibilities (like appendix abnormalities, diverticulitis or signs of infectious colitis) also favors the diagnosis of colonic ischemia.

D: Malignant growth with unknown primary tumor. 

Explanation: The patient's history of endometriosis and an elevated CA-125 level along with CT findings indicating multiple abnormal findings including a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants, strongly suggest malignancy. The palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and the fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen found during the bimanual examination further support the suspicion of malignancy. While the exact primary site of the tumor may be unclear, these findings are highly suggestive of advanced malignancy rather than inflammation or infection.

665
D: Perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy.

Explanation: Given that the initial tests and treatments did not yield a definitive diagnosis and the patient’s symptoms have not improved, it seems most likely that further testing is necessary. A second lacrimal gland biopsy would allow for further evaluation of the abnormal cells in the patient's lacrimal gland. The antibiotic and immunosuppressive treatments proposed in options A and B would be appropriate if an infection or an autoimmune condition had been identified; but without a clear diagnosis, these treatments could potentially exacerbate the condition, especially in the case of potent immunosuppressants such as methotrexate. Option C, performing external beam radiotherapy to the orbit, would be too aggressive without a clear diagnosis, as this approach generally carries significant risks of side effects and is typically reserved for cases in which malignancy or other serious conditions have been identified.

B: Perform orbitotomy with excision. 

Explanation: In this case, the child presents with a right orbital cyst which is compressing the eyeball, making it invisible. This is a severe presentation and needs immediate intervention. The best management plan would be to perform an orbitotomy with excision. This surgical procedure will eliminate the cyst and release the pressure on the eyeball thus allowing normal development. As for other options, aspiration could not offer a permanent solution as cyst may recur. Radiotherapy is generally not recommended for infants because of the risk of long-term side effects including secondary malignancies. Intralesional corticosteroids may help in shrinking the cyst but have a risk of potential side effects and are not recommended in this case due its large size and the child's young age.

D: Perform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis. 

Explanation: Given the patient's contact history with a bloody raccoon carcass, the presentation, and granulomatous conjunctivitis, it is crucial to consider infections that could be transmitted by this kind of exposure, particularly Bartonella henselae (also known as cat-scratch disease) and Francisella tularensis (the causative agent for tularemia). These conditions may not respond to the previously given antibiotic treatment, and specific testing is needed to confirm either diagnosis. Option D thus suggests serologic testing for these pathogens as the most appropriate next step.

668
B: Indocyanine green angiography, fluorescein angiography, or both

Explanation: The presence of submacular hemorrhage and pigment epithelial detachment suggests a possible choroidal neovascularization process, which may be secondary to age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or other chorioretinal disorders. Indocyanine green angiography or fluorescein angiography would be the most appropriate next tests as they can differentiate the various conditions, define the extent of the neovascular complex, and guide therapy. On the other hand, a CT scan of the brain is not necessary as the patient lacks neurological symptoms. B-scan ultrasonography would likely be unremarkable, as it is typically reserved for cases with media opacity that limits the view of the fundus. Autofluorescence wouldn't specifically help in identifying the cause of the hemorrhage or guiding therapy.

A: Initiate uveitis workup and start topical corticosteroid therapy.

Explanation: The man's symptoms including sudden painful decrease in vision, conjunctival hyperemia, keratic precipitates, and cells in the anterior chamber are suggestive of uveitis—an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye. Uveitis could be caused by various factors, including viral infection, fungal infection, bacterial infection, parasitic infection, or autoimmune diseases. Because of the acute nature of the symptoms, it's important to first rule out any infectious causes and start therapy to reduce inflammation. A uveitis workup would typically include tests such as complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, chest x-ray, and possibly other tests based on the patient's history and presentation. Topical corticosteroids could be used to help reduce the inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Other options might also need to be considered based on the results of the uveitis workup. Therefore, first initiating a uveitis workup and starting topical corticosteroid therapy would be the initial logical step.

B: Administer intravitreal corticosteroid injection. 

Explanation: Given the persistent postoperative subretinal fluid inferonasally and yellowish subfoveal precipitates, an intravitreal corticosteroid injection is a valid option. This treatment can help reduce inflammation, allowing for resorption of the subretinal fluid and potentially improving the central scotoma. The patient's intraocular pressure is currently well-controlled and should be closely monitored following the injection due to the risk of steroid-induced glaucoma. The other options (A: Observation; C: Laser photocoagulation; D: Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser) may not effectively address the current clinical findings and may carry unnecessary risk at this juncture.

D: Mucormycosis. 

Explanation: 

The appearance of the skin lesion and the presence of neutropenia in a patient undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia raises the suspicion for invasive fungal infection. The patient’s clinical presentation and hyperglycemic state hint towards angioinvasive fungal infections such as Mucormycosis. The distinct clinical feature of mucormycosis includes necrotic black eschar surrounded by erythema, which is congruent with the violaceous to black plaque with central hemorrhagic bulla on the patient's lower back. Also, Mucormycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection that typically occurs in immunocompromised patients, notably those with hematologic malignancies and uncontrolled diabetes, both of which apply to this patient. Therefore, the answer is D: Mucormycosis.

B: Obtain a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue and weight gain, despite being on diuretics, along with physical findings of elevated jugular venous pressure and pitting edema in the lower extremities, and echocardiogram findings showing impaired right ventricular function and elevated tricuspid valve gradient, all suggest right-sided heart failure. As she has antiphospholipid syndrome, which increases the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic events, one possible cause of right-sided heart failure in this patient is chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTEPH is a form of pulmonary hypertension caused by organized thrombi obstructing the pulmonary vasculature.

The first-line testing for CTEPH, as recommended in the guidelines, is a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (Option B), favored for its broad availability, high sensitivity, capability to visualize both the pulmonary arteries and lung parenchyma, and low complication rate. Right heart catheterization (Option C) is used to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, but it doesn't identify the cause. Fluoroscopy (Option A) isn't as sensitive in identifying pulmonary thromboemboli as CT angiogram. Coronary angiography (Option D) may be necessary for evaluation of left-sided heart disorders, but it isn't indicated in this patient as the findings are indicative of right-sided heart disease.

673
B: The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.

Explanation: The prothrombin time (PT) is a measure of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and is sensitive to anticoagulation effects of drugs like rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban specifically inhibits Factor Xa, which is a part of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation. In presence of this medication, it is expected that PT would be prolonged. Hence in this patient, the abnormal PT is indicative of anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban, which can increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Although his aPTT is normal, it doesn't rule out the anticoagulant effect of Rivaroxaban because PT is a more sensitive test for this purpose. Therefore, surgery would not be safe until the effect of the drug wears off.

D: Perform further evaluation for subclinical hypercortisolism.

Explanation: This patient's adrenal mass characteristics make adrenal cortical carcinoma or adrenal metastasis unlikely, but he may have a cortisol-producing adenoma, given the modest elevation in cortisol after the dexamethasone suppression test. His type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia could be metabolic consequences of chronic endogenous glucocorticoid excess. The absence of typical Cushing syndrome features (eg, purple striae, moon facies, supraclavicular fat pads, proximal muscle weakness) does not rule out subclinical hypercortisolism, because these develop at higher cortisol levels.

Therefore, the patient should undergo further testing to exclude cortisol excess. A second-line confirmatory test such as a late-night salivary cortisol, 24-hour urine free cortisol or a longer dexamethasone suppression test can be performed.

The initial biochemical evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma should include cortisol, aldosterone, and catecholamines to rule out hormone excess.

C: Cytomegalovirus ulcers

Explanation: The patient's age, clinical symptoms, the appearance of her ulcers, her recent history of intensive care stay (which likely weakened her immune system), and her leukopenia together suggest she is experiencing a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV is a common virus that can cause severe disease in individuals with weakened immune systems, like the elderly. Although ulcers could be related to herpes simplex virus or cutaneous candidiasis, those would normally not cause a systemic response such as leukopenia. Fixed drug eruption primarily causes localized reactions where the drug was applied, not generalized symptoms.

B: Granuloma faciale. 

Explanation: Granuloma faciale is a rare, benign skin disorder characterized by single or multiple cutaneous nodules, usually occurring over the face. It’s usually resistant to treatment, which aligns with her failure to respond to various therapies. Normally associated with erythematous, annular plaques (red, circular patches), which also corresponds to the patient's symptoms. Despite the patient’s lack of response to various treatments and development of more scarring and atrophy, granuloma faciale is generally benign and can occasionally cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring. Finally, the burning sensation is rarely reported in granuloma faciale, but it might relate to the patient’s individual reaction to the condition or the treatment.

C: Annular erythema of infancy

Explanation: The clinical presentation and pathology are most indicative of annular erythema of infancy. This uncommon, benign skin disorder is characterized by expanding annular erythematous plaques that have a tendency to recur. The disorder typically presents within the first two years of life. The definitions often show sparing of the face, palms, and soles. Annular erythema of infancy is often asymptomatic and shows normal laboratory findings. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other potential causes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or drug reactions, must be ruled out first. The histopathological findings, such as perivascular and interstitial inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and eosinophils, support this diagnosis. While erythematous and annular, the other options do not fully account for the clinical presentation and findings. For example, Tinea corporis would typically exhibit scaling and be diagnosed with a KOH prep. Erythema marginatum is associated with rheumatic fever and would be expected to present with other symptoms. Lastly, Erythema migrans is associated with Lyme disease and would require a history of tick exposure, which is not present in this case.

B: Referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy. 

Explanation: In this case, the woman has severe and intractable contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder. Exposure and Response Prevention therapy (ERP) is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy and is considered first-line treatment for OCD. It involves gradually exposing individuals to their fear trigger (in this case, germs or contamination) and teaching them new ways to cope without resorting to OCD rituals (her extensive handwashing and cleaning routines). Given the woman's history of unsuccessful pharmacotherapy trials, ERP may be advisable as it directly targets the underlying OCD symptoms and promotes better coping mechanisms. While other options, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, or further pharmacotherapy might also be considered, ERP is a specifically recognized and effective treatment for OCD and is typically recommended when medications have not been effective.

D: Anti-Ma2 encephalitis

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation and neuroimaging results are highly suggestive of anti-Ma2 encephalitis, a type of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS). Her symptoms such as bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and gait instability, are classically seen in patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis. While her initial tests including acetylcholine receptor antibodies (indicative of Myasthenia Gravis), thyrotropin and thiamine levels (used in diagnosing Wernicke encephalopathy), Lyme antibodies and rapid plasma regain (used to diagnose infectious conditions), and serum gangliside antigen panel (helpful in diagnosing Guillain Barre syndrome) were unremarkable, this is again consistent with anti-Ma2 encephalitis, which typically results in normal findings on these tests. Her steady cognitive decline and characteristic MRI findings of hyperintensities in the thalamus and inferior temporal gyrus suggests a form of encephalitis, further supporting the diagnosis. It is important to note that the patient had a long-term history of tobacco use, positioning her at an increased risk for neoplastic diseases which can trigger anti-Ma2 encephalitis, a paraneoplastic condition.

B: Bronchopulmonary sequestration

Explanation: The description of a lung mass with a "feeding vessel" from the aorta is characteristic of bronchopulmonary sequestration. This condition presents with a segment of lung tissue that is not connected to the bronchial system and typically has an anomalous blood supply from the systemic circulation. The absence of respiratory distress at birth, resolution of hydrops after thoracoamniotic shunting, and recurrence of pleural effusion are also consistent with this diagnosis. Furthermore, the condition often presents with hydrothorax which is seen in this case. Other options like a teratoma, congenital pulmonary airway malformation, or a carcinoma would not typically present with these specific findings.

B: Shave biopsy of lesion.

Explanation: The patient's history of basal cell carcinoma and persistent symptoms despite treatment, along with the presentation of eyelid margin thinning surronded by misdirected eyelashes and central madarosis, points towards a potential malignancy. As such, a shave biopsy of the lesion will allow for histopathological identification of any underlying malignant processes.

B: Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of bilateral optic neuritis, which may result from a variety of infections, but in this case, it's most likely secondary to concurrent systemic herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Candida glabrata infections. Anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet, an antiviral drug effective against HSV, would be appropriate to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment.

While intravitreal injection of amphotericin B (Option A) could be used to treat ocular candidiasis, there is no specific indication of a Candida infection in the eyes here, it's only in her blood. Diagnostic vitrectomy (Option C) is invasive and usually reserved for cases in which less invasive testing is inconclusive. Stereotactic radiation therapy (Option D) is used to treat malignant lesions in the optic nerve, which is not the case in this situation. Therefore, Option B is the favored choice.

A. 

Explanation: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with and without contrast is a reasonable next step. Given the nonspecific findings on CT, an MRI can provide additional soft tissue details. It might help in identifying subtle masses or inflammation that could be causing the proptosis and other symptoms. A serologic workup (B) could be considered, however, the lack of systemic symptoms makes an infectious or inflammatory cause less likely. Chest CT (C) might be considered if there's suspicion of a metastatic tumor causing orbital symptoms, but there's no indication of that in the provided history. Observation (D) could delay necessary intervention if there's an underlying condition causing the patient's symptoms. Therefore, an MRI can provide more information to guide further management.
B: Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.

Explanation: The choice of inflating the anterior chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device is a common technique used in ophthalmic surgery. This procedure is usually performed to help maintain or restore the depth of the anterior chamber and protect the cornea. The ophthalmic viscosurgical device provides a clear, viscous substance that can fill the anterior chamber, manage its depth, and help provide better visualization for the ophthalmologist during examination. This would not only improve the safety of the procedure, but also enhance the overall outcome of the surgery. Therefore, this seems to be the most appropriate next step in this clinical scenario.

D: Order an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram. 

Explanation: Despite normal examination findings, the patient's progressive, painless loss of vision indicates potential retinal dysfunction. Therefore, an electroretinogram (ERG) and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), which assess retinal function, may be useful. The patient history of hydroxychloroquine use supports this direction, as this drug has been linked to retinal toxicity. While stopping hydroxychloroquine could be considered, this action alone may not provide immediate insight into the cause of the vision loss. As for options B and C, the absence of other neurologic signs or symptoms makes an infectious process or neuromyelitis optica less likely.

686
C: Perform a biopsy of the mass.

Explanation: This case gives a clear indication of an orbital mass which could have a neoplastic origin or a chronic infectious cause. It is necessary to clearly identify the nature and origin of this mass to determine the proper treatment. An biopsy of the mass is an invasive but more definitive way to identify the nature of the mass. Although the patient is currently asymptomatic, for the progressive, painless, left-sided proptosis, a clear diagnosis is essential to prevent possible future complications. Employing the wait and watch approach could lead to possible growth or metastasis if it is neoplastic. Empirical treatment with antiparasitic agents without clear evidence of parasitic origin is not the best approach. Whole body PET can also be considered but it may not provide a clear diagnosis. Therefore, performing a biopsy would be the most suitable next step.

687
C: Ewing sarcoma (soft-tissue metastasis)

Explanation: The patient's history, the imaging findings, and the high uptake of FDG as seen on PET scanning all suggest a diagnosis of a Ewing sarcoma metastasis. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant small round cell tumor and the painless growing mass in the right thigh of the patient was confirmed to be this type of tumor. The second lesion in the left ankle joint, showing high uptake of FDG (indicative of an active lesion), is most likely a metastasis from the primary Ewing sarcoma in the thigh. The fact that there is vague pain around the ankle further supports this diagnosis. Moreover, other given options (ganglion cyst of the ankle joint, tenosynovial giant cell tumor, synovial sarcoma) would typically not show such a high FDG uptake in PET scans nor present as smaller secondary lesions like the one in the ankle in this case.

688
B: Administer unfractioned heparin and bridge to warfarin.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent dyspnea paired with the TTE result indicating stenosis of the bioprosthetic aortic valve lead to the suspicion of potential thrombosis. Thrombus formation on the prosthetic valve leaflets can cause limited mobility and dysfunction, leading to valve stenosis and recurrence of symptoms. Administration of unfractionated heparin, and then bridging to warfarin would provide therapeutic anticoagulation which is often the initial step in managing prosthetic valve thrombosis. The 4-D CT findings also support this choice, as they reveal nodular filling defects along the leaflets, consistent with thrombus. Voiding alternatives like 'obtaining blood cultures and administering antibiotics' makes sense if there was suspicion for infective endocarditis which is not directly suggested by the signs in this case. Likewise increasing the dosage of anti-platelets or pursuing an urgent valve replacement might not be the initial step without first attempting medical management of the potential thrombosis.

689
D: Solitary fibrous tumor. 

Explanation: The patient's history of having a slow-growing facial lesion for more than 20 years, clinical examination showing no lymphadenopathy and a non-mobile mass, as well as imaging depicting a well-circumscribed mass in the parapharyngeal space without osseous extension, and histological findings of a paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with a myxocollagenous matrix, all favor a diagnosis of a solitary fibrous tumor. 

A solitary fibrous tumor is a rare neoplasm that commonly originates from the pleura but can originate from various other sites, including the head and neck. The key pathological features have been demonstrated in the patient's biopsy, which showed a paucicellular, well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of spindle cells with the morphology of myofibroblasts in a myxocollagenous matrix. These findings are characteristic of a solitary fibrous tumor. The slow growth of the tumor as seen in this case is also consistent with the clinical behavior of solitary fibrous tumors, which are usually indolent. The other options such as Desmoid-type fibromatosis and neurofibroma typically have different histological and clinical features that do not match with the patient's presentation and findings.
C
690
D: Replace omeprazole with nortriptyline.

Explanation: This patient has functional heartburn (FH), a functional esophageal disorder, diagnosed by: symptoms of heartburn; objective evidence of no gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), such as normal EGD findings and normal biopsy findings; and no major esophageal motor disorders (represented here by the normal esophageal high-resolution manometry). FH is managed with stepwise therapy focusing initially on patient reassurance and lifestyle modification. If symptoms persist, like in this patient, a trial of treatment for potential neuropathic pain with neuromodulators (eg, tricyclic antidepressants like nortriptyline) is more appropriate than increasing the proton pump inhibitor dosage or performing surgery. Although proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are effective for GERD, they have limited efficacy in functional heartburn because acid reflux is not the predominant underlying pathophysiology.

B: Pyoderma gangrenosum

Explanation: Pyoderma gangrenosum, although rare in infants, is often misdiagnosed due to its presentation often simulating various dermatoses and infections. The patient's clinical history and the histopathologic findings of neutrophilic inflammation supports the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. This condition is characterized by rapidly progressive, painful, necrotizing ulcers, and it can occur anywhere in the body, including anogenital area. Features that indicate the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum rather than the other options included the rapid progression of the ulcer, the presence of undermined borders, and the exclusion of infectious etiology. Pyoderma gangrenosum often requires immunosuppressive therapy due to the immune-mediated pathophysiology in order to control the lesion progression.

C: Disseminated annular granuloma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of polymorphic erythematous macules and plaques with elevated and indurated borders and no response to antihistamines and oral corticosteroids points towards granulomatous diseases rather than vasculitis. Histopathological analysis showing a chronic dermic granulomatous process with a perineural distribution formed by mature epitheloid cells and encapsulated by lymphocytes is strongly associated with granulomatous conditions like disseminated annular granuloma. The lack of other systemic symptoms and normal blood tests make other options less likely. Although Sarcoidosis could also present with noncaseating granulomas, it often has systemic symptoms and lung involvement, which were not reported in this case. Borderline leprosy and Mycosis fungoides usually present with other distinctive dermatological or neurological features, which were not mentioned in the presented case. Thus, the most probable diagnosis is Disseminated annular granuloma.

B: Linear porokeratosis. 

Explanation: Linear porokeratosis is a variant of porokeratosis, which is a disorder of keratinization. It is characterized by linear lesions following the lines of Blaschko, as seen in this patient. The presentation of asymptomatic, reddish, punctate, linear keratotic papules that have been present since birth are all consistent with this diagnosis. Epidermal nevus, porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, and linear Darier disease would present differently in terms of lesion distribution, color, and texture, making linear porokeratosis the most likely diagnosis. It's always important to confirm the diagnosis through histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen as in this case.

694
C: Orbital apex syndrome

Explanation: The symptoms presented by the 8-year-old boy strongly indicate an orbital apex syndrome. This is potentially caused by lesions at the orbital apex or within the cavernous sinus which affect the ocular motor nerves (cranial nerves III, IV, and VI) responsible for eye movements and the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve which is responsible for the sensation in the upper part of the face and eye. The patient experienced visual symptoms (double vision, periorbital swelling, proptosis, ptosis) and had certain distinct clinical findings (severe ophthalmoparesis, diminished corneal reflex). The absence of pain, fever, leukocytosis, and resistance to eye movement on palpation of the globe typically seen with an orbital cellulitis also align more with orbital apex syndrome. Thyroid eye disease usually presents with thyroid symptoms which were missing in this case. Likewise, cavernous sinus syndrome would likely present with additional symptoms like headache, seizures, or sensory loss in other parts of the face, not seen in the boy.

695
B: Atrioesophageal fistula 

Explanation: The patient's history of recent atrial fibrillation ablation, along with onset of neurologic symptoms, fever, and sepsis raise the possibility of an atrioesophageal fistula, a rare but often fatal complication of ablation. Findings on imaging (areas of cortical diffusion restriction not typical of ischemic injury, significant T2 changes, pneumocephalus) further indicate this diagnosis. Streptococcus mitis bacteremia can be associated with this condition. The lack of vegetation on TEE makes bacterial endocarditis less likely. Cardioembolic stroke is a possibility, but less likely given the imaging findings and presence of fevers. Patent foramen ovale with paradoxical embolus is not suggested by the given information. The abrupt clinical worsening in the supine position is coherent with air embolism—a known complication of atrioesophageal fistula.

D: Scrotal cystocele. 

Explanation: A scrotal cystocele refers to the herniation of the bladder into the scrotum. The features presented, such as more prominent swelling in the morning and age group, are common in patients with scrotal cystocele. The condition is more common among obese individuals, as in the case described. The physical examination features also suggest this diagnosis, as the swelling is not reducible and the testicle is not palpable. A condition like hydrocele or testicular torsion would likely present with symptoms like pain and nausea, which are not reported in this case, ruling them out as likely diagnoses. The CT scan would also offer more clarity in this regard.

B. 

Explanation: Given the report of right-sided blurry vision, normal eye examination results, and the presence of homonymous hemianopia in a patient with acute neurologic symptoms, further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the symptoms. MRI of the brain reveals a subacute infarction affecting the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. While prophylactic migraine treatment (Option A) may help the patient's headaches, it is unlikely to address the stroke-like findings on the MRI. Tissue plasminogen activator (Option C) is used for acute stroke victims, typically within hours of symptom onset and therefore not suitable for this subacute case. Observing the patient (Option D) without addressing potential underlying cardiovascular disease could lead to further strokes. Consequently, it is best to perform cerebral angiography (Option B) to identify the potential source and degree of any cerebral vascular occlusion, which underlies the infarct. This patient’s presentation suggests a probable embolic source that might require anticoagulation or other intervention.
C: Follow up in 12 months to reexamine the lesion. 

Explanation: The patient presents no other symptoms apart from blurry vision, which was resolved with new eyeglasses. The posterior segment examination only showed an abnormality in the right eye, while the examination of the left eye was normal. Given the patient’s young age, the absence of other health-related symptoms, and the solitary occurrence of the lesion makes other diagnostic procedures less necessary at this point. Management of this case can consist of careful observation and reexamination after 12 months to check for any changes or progression in the condition of the lesion. Refraining from immediate invasive procedures would be best given the patient's overall health status.

C: Search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination.

Explanation: The patient's recent travel to Ireland and horse riding, along with the sudden onset of visual loss, may suggest the possibility of infectious or parasitic causes, such as Diffuse Unilateral Subacute Neuroretinitis (DUSN). This condition is a rare, progressive ocular infectious disease caused by nematodes. The small glistening lesions and attenuated ellipsoid zone observed in the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) may represent larval tracks or dead larvae, which are characteristic in DUSN. Therefore, it would be appropriate to search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination (Option C) as the next step.

D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). LHON usually presents as painless, subacute, and sequential bilateral vision loss leading to central scotoma and severely decreased visual acuity. This monogenic mitochondrial disease results from a mutation mostly affecting young males, but females and middle-aged people may also be affected. Given the history of vision loss in a relative, and considering the normal results of initial tests and imaging, a genetic test for LHON would be an appropriate next step to identify a pathogenic mutation and confirm the diagnosis. Checking the methylmalonic acid level would have been ideal if there was a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is not the case here. Repetition of MRI and lumbar puncture are less likely to yield fruitful results, considering the normal MRI initially and absence of symptoms suggesting an infiltrative or inflammatory process respectively. These are invasive or expensive procedures that can be reserved if other avenues of investigation are inconclusive.

D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. 

Explanation: 

Given the patient’s history and clinical findings, a genetic cause is more probable, and initial consideration should be given to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), an inherited mitochondrial disease characterized by acute or subacute bilateral vision loss in young adults. However, it can present in various stages of life. The cecocentral scotoma seen on visual field testing is suggestive of LHON. The elevation and hyperemia of the optic nerves and absence of relative afferent pupillary defect also complement the diagnosis. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause a similar clinical picture, but in this case, the B12 level was normal. Repeated MRI or lumbar puncture will also unlikely be beneficial, because the MRI was normal and the clinical picture does not suggest an inflammatory cause. The family history of vision loss in a maternal cousin due to diagnosed optic neuritis could indicate a family history of optic neuropathy, further pointing toward a genetic cause like LHON.

D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

Explanation: In this patient with bilateral (though not symmetric) central scotomas, optic disc hyperemia, abnormal color vision, and lack of alternative medications or systemic symptoms, a genetic optic neuropathy, such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), is most likely. LHON often presents with sequential vision loss in both eyes, as seen in this patient, and can often mimic optic neuritis. Normal vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonic acid levels rule out nutritional deficiencies. Therefore, testing for possible genetic causes is warranted in this scenario. Despite the typical onset of LHON being in young adulthood, 10%-15% of patients can present later in life, often with less severe vision loss. It's also noteworthy that LHON is maternally inherited, aligning with the patient's family history of her maternal cousin's vision loss.

C: Initiate acetazolamide

Explanation: The condition that the patient is exhibiting is known as papilledema, which signifies raised intracranial pressure. The absence of symptoms often associated with increased intracranial pressure, such as headache or visual changes, can make this a challenging diagnosis. A lumbar puncture with an opening pressure of 35 mm Hg further suggests an elevated intracranial pressure. 

The reported insect bites might intuitively guide diagnosis towards an infectious cause, particularly considering the patient's stay in Gabon. However, since the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample showed normal cell counts, protein, glucose, and a negative gram stain, there's no substantial evidence to suggest an infectious process as the reason for elevated ICP. Discontinuing doxycycline seems unnecessary because it's not typically associated with elevated intracranial pressure.

Treatment for increased intracranial pressure often involves a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, such as acetazolamide. This medication reduces the production of CSF, consequently decreasing intracranial pressure. So, "answer C: Initiate acetazolamide" would be a reasonable next step while additional workup is conducted. Of course, the patient should be monitored closely for any changes or development of symptoms. The appearance of new symptoms or worsening condition would warrant further diagnostic measures to ascertain other possible causes.

D: Genetic testing. 

Explanation: Given the variable multisystemic involvement, such as developmental abnormalities, including those affecting the cerebellum and vertebrae, ocular anomalies including the presence of posterior embryotoxon and corectopia, a broad nasal bridge, hypertelorism, short stature, and hearing loss, the patient may have a heterogeneous genetic disorder. Additionally, there is no reported family history of similar abnormalities, which further suggests the possibility of a de novo mutation. Therefore, a comprehensive genetic analysis would indeed be the next most appropriate step in this case. Other options may be considered depending on the underlying genetic diagnosis and/or additional clinical findings. For example, strabismus surgery could eventually be required, however at this point, it would not be the immediate next step. Similarly, while ocular hypotensive therapy and OCT angiography can also be helpful, they would likely be subsequent considerations following the outcome of a genetic test.

C: Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm

Explanation: The histological findings of small to medium cells infiltrating into the subcutaneous fat, along with the immunophenotypic features of CD4+, CD33+, CD43+, CD56+, CD123+, TCL1+ cells, and high Ki-67 index are suggestive of Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (CBPDCN), making this diagnosis the most probable. CBPDCN represents a distinct clinical entity with an aggressive course and a poor prognosis, originating from plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors and typically presents with cutaneous lesions. Other options are less likely due to the immunohistochemical staining results and the patient's medical history. While myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can be associated with skin lesions in the form of leukemia cutis, the presence of such extensive skin involvement with absence of circulating blasts makes leukemia cutis an unlikely diagnosis. Similarly, transformed mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome typically show CD3+ and CD4+ T-cell infiltration which is not present in this patient. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, typically demonstrate a CD30+ tumor cells, which was not reported in this patient.

A: Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In STEMI, immediate revascularization is recommended. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is typically the revascularization method of choice, as it is less invasive and associated with fewer complications than coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Drug-eluting stents are often preferred because they release a drug that prevents restenosis, or re-narrowing of the artery after the procedure. Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds have been used too but are associated with a higher rate of device thrombosis and are generally reserved for specific circumstances. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) would typically be reserved for patients with disease not amenable to PCI or those with significant disease in the left main coronary artery or with severe multivessel CAD. Deferred intervention and supportive management alone would generally not be appropriate in the setting of an acute STEMI.

A: Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents 

Explanation: Given the patient's young age, absence of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, and the presence of an anterior acute current of injury as seen in the ECG, the most likely diagnosis is a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). This is a tear in the coronary artery that can lead to a heart attack.  
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred treatment in most cases of SCAD as long as the person is stable and the dissection is in a location that can be reached by catheter. Drug-eluting stents are sometimes used in SCAD to help keep the artery open and reduce the chance of another dissection. 
The use of bioresorbable scaffolds in PCI has been associated with an increased risk of device thrombosis and is currently not recommended, deferring intervention denotes an improper management and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is often reserved for more complex cases or for those in whom PCI is not feasible.

A: Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents

Explanation: Considering the patient's symptoms, diagnostic findings, raised troponin level, and the thrombolysis result, immediate intervention is required. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents is a premier treatment approach for acute coronary syndrome, specifically in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This is based on numerous clinical trials which have demonstrated superiority of this approach to medical therapy alone as it directly addresses the culprit lesion reducing the risks of recurrent chest pain, re-infarction or death. Drug-eluting stents have shown to provide the benefit of reducing restenosis rates when compared to bare-metal stents or bioresorbable vascular scaffolds. An emergency coronary artery bypass grafting surgery might be a consideration for multi-vessel disease or left main disease, which doesn't seem to be the case in this patient. Furthermore, PCI is less invasive and has a fairly quicker recovery time. Defer intervention and continue supportive management is not an ideal choice given the patient's progressive rise in troponin levels and ECG changes indicating an ongoing myocardial injury.

D: Rosai-Dorfman disease. 

Explanation: Rosai-Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare, idiopathic, nonmalignant histiocytic proliferative disorder. The disease mainly affects children and young adults and is characterized by painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. The key feature is the presence of large phagocytic histiocytes that exhibit emperipolesis, engulfing lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils without causing cellular damage. The disease site may confound the diagnosis because it can present in extranodal sites, including skin, upper respiratory tract, and salivary glands. In this case, the patient's clinical symptoms, history, the biopsy findings of numerous histiocytes and emperipolesis demonstrated by positive CD-30 and S-100 staining establish the diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease.

706
C: Pleomorphic adenoma

Explanation: The histopathologic features of the nodule which include encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, duct-like structures, and mixed stroma are all characteristic of pleomorphic adenoma. A mucocele (Option A) typically occurs due to trauma or obstruction of the salivary gland duct and is a collection of mucus rather than a tumor. Lipoma (Option B) is a benign tumor of fatty tissue and would not present with salivary gland histopathology. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (Option D) is a type of malignancy and would feature more aggressive features including local invasiveness and possible metastasis.  Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the diagnosis is Pleomorphic adenoma (Option C).

D: Bowen disease

Explanation: The key features of this patient's case, including the single erythematous scaling plaque on the lower eyelid along with the absence of eyelashes, and the dermoscopy findings of an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and scales, strongly suggest the diagnosis of Bowen disease, also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The slow growth over several years is also compatible with this diagnosis. While the other conditions listed can cause similar skin changes, they are less likely given the specific characteristics and clinical context of this patient's presentation. Sarcoidosis typically presents with multiple skin lesions, discoid lupus erythematosus usually involves other areas of the body and has more systemic symptoms, and basal cell carcinoma is less likely given the lesion's slow growth and lack of more aggressive features.

D: Necrobiosis lipoidica

Explanation: The presence of erythematous plaques surmounted by atrophic scars in the pretibial areas corresponds to the classic description of Necrobiosis lipoidica. The histological image supports this diagnosis, showing typical features of necrobiosis lipoidica, including palisading granulomas and central areas of collagen degeneration. Although Necrobiosis lipoidica is traditionally associated with diabetes, it can also occur in non-diabetic individuals, as in this case. The disease has a predilection for the pretibial areas. The other options Granulomatous mycosis fungoides, Pretibial myxedema and Cutaneous sarcoidosis do not typically present with the same clinical and histopathological features.

B: Cutaneous silica granuloma

Explanation: The miner's profession and the fact that the growths developed some 15 years after he sustained injuries in a mine explosion strongly suggest cutaneous silica granuloma. This condition is a foreign body reaction where silica particles are left in the skin due to penetrating injuries. The nodules and papules occurred at the exact points where the miner had previously suffered wounds, indicating a possible link to residual foreign matter. The matter may have triggered an immune response, leading to granuloma formation. This condition is often seen in miners or individuals with a history of occupational exposure to silica. The late onset also corresponds with the behavior of granulomas, which can take years to develop. The other choices: Sarcoidosis, infectious granuloma, and keloid, less likely due to the absence of symptoms related to organ involvement, signs of infection, or history of abnormal/heavy scarring.

D: Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm.

Explanation: 
The examination suggested that the patient had a distended abdomen, suggesting the possible presence of internal bleeding. The CT images showed a large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma and grade IV renal laceration displacing the patient’s abdominal viscera to the left, with a contrast-filled structure medial to the liver. This could signify the rupture of a pseudoaneurysm in the peripancreatic region which could be the source of continued bleeding. The other options such as hepatic artery injury, jejunal injury with intraluminal contrast extravasation, or a contrast-enhancing gallbladder do not sufficiently explain all the symptoms and observations from the CT scans.

C: Do plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema did not appear to respond to standard treatments including intravitreal bevacizumab and triamcinolone acetonide injections. Additionally, the patient's blood work indicated some abnormalities. These factors, combined with the patient's systemic health and ineffective treatment results, suggest the need for a diagnostic workup to rule out other causes of the retinal changes observed. As such, Act C: plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis, is the most suitable next step. This process can help identify the presence of any abnormal protein in the blood (monoclonal gammopathy) that may be related to the retinal pathology called paraproteinemic maculopathy. This is more important considering the subject's age. This diagnosis, if confirmed, can guide the making of a more effective management plan.

B: Discontinue cidofovir therapy, and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia

Explanation: This patient's photophobia, shallow anterior chambers, bilateral posterior synechiae, and bilateral choroidal effusions suggest cidofovir-induced uveitis and choroidal effusions. Both the patient's renal function and pattern of inflammation (predominantly posterior with minimal anterior chamber inflammation) support the diagnosis of drug-induced intraocular inflammation. Cidofovir is known to cause drug-induced uveitis with secondary choroidal effusions, especially in patients with impaired renal function. The treatment strategy for drug-induced uveitis involves the discontinuation of the offending agent along with the administration of topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia to control inflammation and prevent complications, such as synechiae formation. Because cidofovir was the only recent ocular drug exposure, withdrawal is likely to lead to resolution, and no further diagnostic testing is generally necessary. While systemic corticosteroids could be used in refractory cases, topical treatment is often sufficient. Thus option B is the next best step.

B: Determine blood glucose level and perform glycated hemoglobin test.

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests a systemic hyperglycemic state. She has had long-standing type 1 diabetes and has proliferative diabetic retinopathy affecting both eyes. Lowering blood glucose levels and optimizing glycemic control are key management strategies for patients with diabetic retinopathy. This will help mitigate the risk of further complications and hopefully stabilize the patient's retinopathy. It is essential to determine her blood glucose level and perform a glycated hemoglobin test, which would provide information about her average blood glucose levels over 2 to 3 months. These tests will aid in managing and optimizing her glycemic state. Other listed options might be informative but are not as immediately necessary based on the patient's current ocular and systemic status.

B: Optic nerve sheath biopsy

Explanation: In this case, the teenager's ongoing vision loss, worsening visual acuity, optic nerve atrophy, and the findings of thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths on MRI strongly suggest a pathological process. Although optic nerve sheath meningiomas could explain these features, a biopsy is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential pathologies, such as optic nerve gliomas, sarcoidosis, or lymphoma. It would not be appropriate to proceed with radiotherapy until the exact nature of the pathology is established. Observation would not be practical, considering the continuous nature of the vision loss. Hence, the most applicable step would be to perform an optic nerve sheath biopsy (Option B).

B: Trichoepitheliomas. 

Explanation: The clinical and histologic features are consistent with the diagnosis of multiple familial trichoepitheliomas (MFT). Trichoepitheliomas are benign hair follicle neoplasms that typically begin appearing during adolescence or early adulthood. The presence of multiple tumours suggests the familial form of the disease. Although this patient did not present with severe acne, the presence of these facial papules along with her diagnosis of lichen planopilaris, could suggest a co-occurrence of both conditions. The current treatment with hydroxychloroquine for her LPP would not affect the appearance or symptoms of her facial papules, which aligns with the patient's experience. A biopsy confirmed the presence of trichoepitheliomas. Other options like lichen planopilaris, miliary osteoma cutis, and angiofibromas were ruled out based on her symptom presentation and the biopsy results.

B: Metastatic Crohn disease

Explanation: The presentation of linear moist, eroded, exophytic, condyloma-like plaques and ulcers in intertriginous regions, in combination with the history of ineffective treatments and failure to control with a typical treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa, suggests metastatic Crohn disease (MCD). MCD is a rare cutaneous manifestation of Crohn disease characterised by noncaseating granulomas in skin that is noncontiguous with the gastrointestinal tract. This disease often presents as exophytic plaques or nodules, often in the intertriginous regions. These lesions can often be mistaken for infected hidradenitis suppurativa or genital warts, particularly in patients with history of inflammatory bowel disease. However, MCD does not respond to antibiotics or incision and drainage because it is not primarily an infectious process, which is consistent with the patient's history. This diagnosis can be confirmed by biopsy, which typically shows noncaseating granulomas. Although, the patient didn't have a diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease, it could be occult or subclinical which is not unusual in MCD. The absence of oral involvement and the biopsy results made C and D less likely.

717
B: Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis

Explanation: Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) should be highly suspected in this case due to the presence of disseminated erythematous papules, petechial hemorrhages, and yellowish crusts on the scalp. Notably, the ineffectiveness of glucocorticosteroids and antibiotics, and the presence of osteolytic lesions on the MRI scan also support this diagnosis. Moreover, the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy reveals large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, solitary lymphocytes, and eosinophilic granulocytes, which are common findings in LCH. Additionally, the positive staining for CD1A further assists in confirming LCH, as CD1A is a common marker for Langerhans cells. Seborrheic dermatitis, crusted scabies, and Psoriasis vulgaris do not typically present with these features and findings.

D: Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury.

Explanation: Choice D is the best option in this case. The child's behavioral issues, along with self-injurious actions indicate an immediate need for behavioral intervention. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, has FDA approval for treatment of irritability in autistic disorder and could be beneficial to manage this child’s severe tantrums, impulsivity, and self-injurious behavior. While family genetic testing (Choice A) could be considered, it won't immediately address the child's current health and safety needs. Moreover, introducing R-baclofen (Choice B) as a pharmacotherapy option based only on animal models might not be prudent. Citalopram (Choice C) could potentially help with repetitive behavior but does not address the self-injurious and impulsive tendencies which pose immediate threats.

D

719
D: Neurotuberculosis.

Explanation: Given the patient's history, MRI findings, and results of various described tests, Neurotuberculosis is the most probable diagnosis. The patient's radiological features including granulomatous lesions and meningeal enhancement, along with a positive Mantoux test result and a high serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level, are suggestive of this diagnosis. Despite negative results from mycobacterial cultures and CSF adenosine deaminase levels, Neurotuberculosis remains a probable diagnosis, considering the possibility of latent disease. Neurotuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis that affects the nervous system, leading to complications such as stroke. Notably, tuberculosis is more common in India, and the diagnosis aligns well with the patient's chronology of symptoms and laboratory data, taking into account the sensitivity and specificity of various tests. Other listed differential diagnoses like COL4A1 gene mutation, primary angiitis, and polyarteritis nodosa do not entirely reflect the patient's detailed history and investigative findings.

D: Neurotuberculosis

Explanation: The evidence in the presented case best supports the diagnosis of neurotuberculosis. The key indicative factors include: the patient's ethnic background (Indian) where tuberculosis is prevalent; the symptoms presented, starting with the right corona radiata infarct and right perisylvanian ring-enhancing and nodular granulomatous lesions, which developed into several new lesions and hemorrhages over 7 years; the positive Mantoux test, although other tuberculosis tests were negative; elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level; presence of small calcified granulomas in the anterior mediastinum; and the lack of efficacy of other blood, CSF, and scan test results to diagnose processes such as inflammation or vascular abnormalities that would be indicative of the other answer choices. This diagnosis would particularly explain the recurrent neurological deficits as due to progressive infection.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
D: Neurotuberculosis. 

Explanation: Neurotuberculosis is a serious manifestation of tuberculosis (TB) infection, which can affect the brain, spinal cord, or other parts of the nervous system. The patient's history of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, skin lesions suggestive of erythema nodosum, granulomatous lesions in the brain, a positive Mantoux test, and raised serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels all point to Neurotuberculosis. Although the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mycobacterial cultures were negative, the diagnosis cannot be ruled out as the sensitivity of the test varies and can be quite low, particularly in extrapulmonary TB. Normal angiography results rule out vasculitis such as primary angiitis of the central nervous system and polyarteritis nodosa. The lack of any specific genetic testing or familial history makes COL4A1 gene mutation unlikely. The presence of neurological symptoms along with evidence of latent TB points towards Neurotuberculosis being the most likely diagnosis.

D: Juvenile plantar dermatosis.

Explanation: Juvenile plantar dermatosis is a skin condition that primarily affects children and adolescents. The condition typically presents as dry, scaly skin on the soles of the feet, often with a 'sandal' distribution. The negative potassium hydroxide test helps to rule out tinea pedis (a fungal infection), and the lack of a history of atopic dermatitis makes this diagnosis less likely. Psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris are less likely given the patient's age and specific location of the lesions.

B: Testicular cancer

Explanation: The patient's symptoms including abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, a palpable abdominal mass, a missing left testis, along with evidence of large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses, lymphadenopathy, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and β human chorionic gonadotrophin are indicative of a germ cell tumor, most likely testicular cancer. The missing left testis and enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node are further clues pointing towards this diagnosis. It's important to note that Cryptorchidism (undescended testis) is a known risk factor for testicular cancer. Colorectal and Bladder cancer usually present with changes in bowel and urinary habits respectively, which are not mentioned here. Lymphoma could be a possibility, but the particular detail of missing left testis points more to testicular cancer. The patient's age also makes testicular cancer a more likely diagnosis as it often affects younger men. Additionally, lymphadenopathy associated with lymphoma tends to be more widespread whereas here it is mainly seen in locations reflecting a typical metastasis pattern of testicular cancer. These combined factors lean towards a diagnosis of testicular cancer.

C: Rectosigmoid junction rupture

Explanation: The patient's history of a bicycle accident with abdominal trauma caused by the handlebar, combined with his symptoms of abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting, as well as the physical examination findings of paraumbilical ecchymosis and general abdominal tenderness are indicators of possible intra-abdominal injury. The abdominal CT scan, revealing a pneumoperitoneum and free fluid in the lower quadrants of the abdomen, are signs of a possible perforation in the intestinal tract. Given the patient's history of ulcerative colitis, the rectosigmoid junction, a common site for colitis-associated injuries, could have been compromised leading to a rupture. The presence of normal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and the absence of signs relevant to pancreas or duodenal injury further support the choice of rectosigmoid junction rupture. So, the best choice for this diagnosis is 'Rectosigmoid junction rupture'.

723
A

Explanation: Given the history of trauma to the eye, the presence of vitritis, a cataract with overlying pigment, and discovery of a hyperdense foreign body in the vitreous cavity, it is suggestive of an ocular foreign body leading to a chronic inflammation in the eye i.e. a chronic endophthalmitis. This warrants immediate surgical intervention to remove the foreign body, treat the endophthalmitis, and manage the cataract. Although systemic or topical corticosteroid treatment may be used to suppress the inflammation, it does not address the underlying condition. Observation would not be recommended since the condition is progressively worsening. A laboratory workup could be useful but is not immediately necessary and is less likely to provide a conclusive diagnosis compared to surgical intervention.
B

Explanation: The patient's age, kidney transplant status, and presence of large pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) with associated tears indicate an increased risk of neovascularization. These elements make this patient a potential candidate for development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a condition often treated with the help of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents is used to inhibit the VEGF, that induces angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability. This treatment strategy can help stabilize the patient's visual acuity, and potentially lead to anatomic restoration of the retinal pigment epithelium and resolution of subretinal fluid. Therefore, option B, "Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment," should be chosen as the next step in the management of this patient's condition.
B: Order urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

Explanation: The combination of visual disturbance with acute binocular horizontal diplopia and disorientation indicates the possible involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). The MRI would help visualize any lesions in the brain and provide insights into potential intracranial causes, such as infection, inflammation, tumor, or even demyelinating disease. It's important to establish if any of these are linked to her vision problems. Although other options might be viable in different contexts, under these circumstances prioritizing the brain imaging seems most critical to evaluate manifestations like optic disc swelling, which are classic CNS involvement signs.

B: Review medical history and systemic medications

Explanation: The patient’s presentation of intrascleral pigmentation, possibly drug-induced, as well as pigmentation on her auricles, invites a careful review of her medical history and systemic medications. It is essential to note the use of any systemic medication that can lead to cutaneous or ocular hyperpigmentation. Options A, C, and D can still be considered later, depending on the findings from a thorough review of her history and medications. However, abruptly discontinuing antiglaucomatous medications without first determining whether they are the cause could jeopardize the patient's vision, as her intraocular pressure was in the high normal range during the examination. As such, option B seems to be the most immediate step.

727
B: Perform corneal biopsy 

Explanation: Based on the progression of the condition despite treatment with topical and intravenous antibiotics, it indicates that the infection is likely resistant to the current treatment regimen or that the causative organism has not been accurately identified. A corneal biopsy can potentially identify the causative microorganism and guide specific and targeted therapy. It is also crucial for determining whether the condition is non-infectious, in which case steroids or other immune-suppressive treatments would be indicated. On the other hand, performing another anterior chamber paracentesis procedure may not provide new information as the corneal ulcer is the primary site of infection. Intravitreal antibiotics are usually reserved for posterior infections and not typically the first line of therapy for keratitis. Similarly, starting prednisolone eyedrops without exact confirmation of the condition can potentially worsen an existing infection if not appropriately treated.

728
B: Superficial corneal biopsy

Explanation: The appearance of multicolored, highly refractile crystals in the subepithelium and anterior stroma suggests a possible crystalline keratopathy. A range of systemic and ocular conditions could potentially cause this keratopathy, including drug induced, infections, and genetic disorders. Initiating a new therapy or performing a penetrating keratoplasty might not be appropriate without having a confirmed diagnosis. 

A corneal biopsy could provide a definitive diagnosis by identifying the substance and its origin, thereby guiding the most appropriate therapy. Although initiating topical therapy might manage possible inflammation, it would not identify the cause of these deposits. Starting an antibiotic, like vancomycin, might not be helpful without evidence of infection.

Though concerning, the risk and complexity of a penetrating keratoplasty would not be justified without having a clear understanding of the underlying pathology. Therefore, a corneal biopsy (Option B) should be performed next.

B: Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA)

Explanation: The diagnosis of pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA) is based on a combination of histologic, immunohistochemical and molecular findings. This patient’s tumor has morphologic features and an immunohistochemical profile (CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, and napsin A negative) that is consistent with PEA. The negative results of extensive investigation for a primary malignant neoplasm in the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon, along with the lung location of the adenocarcinoma, are further supportive of the diagnosis of PEA rather than a metastatic disease. PEA is a rare subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that has been incorporated into the 2015 World Health Organization classification. It is characterized by the presence of an enteric component constituting at least 50% of the tumor. Patients with PEA are usually elderly men who have smoked, but this tumor can also occur in patients who have never smoked, as in this patient. PEA is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, but this patient’s disease was localized without lymph node involvement or distant disease.

C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of palpitations, physical exam findings, and changes seen on the electrocardiogram suggest a possible cardiac issue. In cases where the standard 12 lead electrocardiogram shows marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads, it is recommended to obtain an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads. This can provide additional information about possible right ventricular hypertrophy or strain, which could explain the findings seen on the standard electrocardiogram and the patient's symptoms. Moreover, the presence of right-axis deviation and an R wave progression regression in leads V1-V6 could indicate a dextrocardia, which is a congenital condition causing the heart to be situated in the right side of the thorax. This could be further evaluated and confirmed by obtaining an ECG with right-sided precordial leads. This approach is most directly related to the current findings and could provide valuable information to guide further management.

C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads

Explanation: The patient's heart sounds noted to be loudest over the right parasternal area, combined with the ECG findings of marked right axis deviation and poor R wave progression across the precordial leads, may suggest dextrocardia (heart located in right chest). Given the suggested abnormalities on the standard ECG, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain an ECG with right-sided precordial leads that can help confirm the diagnosis of dextrocardia. Dextrocardia is a rare congenital condition that can remain undiagnosed until old age if the patient remains asymptomatic. The presence of dextrocardia can be significant in the evaluation of chest pain or other symptoms related to the heart, as the interpretation of the ECG will need to account for the heart's abnormal location. Other options like troponin I (Option A) or D-dimer levels (Option B) may be considered if there are strong clinical suspicions of coronary artery disease or pulmonary embolism, but these conditions are not suggested by the findings in this case. A ventilation/perfusion lung scan (Option D) could be done if there's suspicion for pulmonary embolism, but again this isn't indicated here due to the clinical presentation and findings.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads

Explanation: This case suggests the possibility of dextrocardia (heart rotated to the right side of the chest) or situs inversus (reversal of organ position in the chest and/or abdomen). Marked right axis deviation and right parasternal heart sounds suggest dextrocardia. The presence of R wave regression across the precordial leads and upright R waves in lead avR further hint towards dextrocardia or situs inversus. Argyle-Robertson syndrome, which occurs in bronchiectasis patients like this one, can result in dextrocardia or situs inversus. Given the findings, it's prudent to obtain an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads to further evaluate for dextrocardia, as this could influence surgical planning and postoperative management for the hip fracture, as well as the interpretation of future chest imaging studies.

C: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. 

Explanation: 
The clinical, radiographic, and pathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RMS is a malignant tumor arising from progenitor mesenchymal cells intended to form skeletal muscle. It is primarily a disease of children, but it can also occur in adults. The alveolar subtype typically shows a more aggressive clinical course and poorer prognosis than embryonal subtypes due to the biological behaviors and additional genetic mutations. Primary sinonasal RMS is relatively rare. Immunohistochemistry plays a vital role in diagnosis, with Alveolar RMS typically showing diffuse positive staining for desmin and myogenin, both of which are seen in this case. The negative findings for AE1/AE3, CK 5/6, CK7, CK20, p40, chromogranin, SOX10, HMB45, CD99, and CD20 help to further differentiate this from other entities, including esthesioneuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

C: Amyloidosis. 

Explanation: The set of symptoms described in this case—such as an abnormal soft-tissue epiglottic mass, splenomegaly, ascites, right atrial and ventricular dilatation, elevated serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria levels, and altered liver function tests—are most indicative of systemic amyloidosis, which is a rare disease characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble abnormal fibrils derived from aggregation of misfolded proteins. Amyloidosis can affect multiple organ systems and can present with wide-ranging clinical manifestations, as seen in this case. Important clues include the deposition of amyloid proteins in the heart and the liver, leading to their respective symptoms, and in the kidney, leading to proteinuria. The retroperitoneal hematoma could also be a result of amyloid deposition. The involvement of the epiglottis is rare but possible in cases of systemic amyloidosis.
C
733
C: Sigmoid sinus diverticulum

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral, pulsatile tinnitus that can be modified by maneuvers altering brain or venous pressures common in individuals with a sigmoid sinus diverticulum (SSD). A SSD is a common venous variant and is associated with pulsatile tinnitus. The absence of other ear-related symptoms or history aids in the elimination of other diagnoses. Also, the fact that it is alleviated through the compression of the right neck hints towards a vascular cause which is characteristic of a sigmoid sinus diverticulum. Furthermore, the CT image presumably shows an out- pouching of the sigmoid sinus into the mastoid part of the temporal bone, which is indicative of a SSD. SSD can be diagnosed by imaging studies such as temporal bone CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV). This condition can be managed medically with reassurances, cognitive behavior therapy, sound therapy (to "mask" the tinnitus noise), and avoidance of triggers. Surgical treatment can also be beneficial in some cases.
C
734
C: Traumatic neuroma from prior surgery

Explanation: Given the patient's history of a surgical excision of a skin cancer in the right ear and the lack of other symptoms such as numbness or new neck masses, the possibility of a traumatic neuroma from the prior surgery is likely. Traumatic neuroma is a benign proliferation of nerve fibers and is often associated with previous nerve damage due to surgery, trauma, or other causes, potentially explaining the patient's description of electric, stabbing pain. The location of the mass along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle may also be consistent with the trajectory of the peripheral nerve damaged during the ear surgery. The other options are less likely as there is no evidence of perineural spread (option D), no symptomatology supporting primary nerve sheath tumor (option A), and no indication of thrombophlebitis (option B) such as a history of intravenous drug use, infection, or trauma.
D
735
B: Obtain glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level

Explanation: Given the skin findings in the context of the patient’s family history of diabetes and similar rash in his sister, the patient is possibly suffering from acanthosis nigricans. A more formal evaluation for diabetes is required here. Diagnosing and managing diabetes and conditions associated can potentially improve the patient's skin condition. While a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial (Option C) may treat some symptoms, without addressing the potential underlying condition (diabetes), it's not likely to provide a long-term solution. Similarly, prescribing topical ketoconazole (Option A) or undertaking surgical excision (Option D) would not necessarily treat the underlying cause of the condition.

A: Aplasia cutis congenita

Explanation: The description of the lesion suggests Aplasia Cutis Congenita (ACC). ACC is a congenital condition characterized by localized or widespread areas of absent skin, typically presenting at birth in a superficial, sharply demarcated ulceration that is often covered by a crust. The scalp is the most commonly affected area. In this case, the variables indicating ACC include the newborn age, the unique characteristics of the lesion (which was non-tender, deep, and extended laterally), and the fact it was covered by a mat and serosanguineous crust. The failure to progress during labor and urgent cesarean delivery may have aggravated the condition. Furthermore, the absence of signs of infection such as purulent drainage or pain also makes a diagnosis of cellulitis, abscess, or group B streptococcal infection less likely.

B: Pancreatic panniculitis

Explanation: Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare form of panniculitis that arises due to the systemic spread of pancreatic enzymes leading to subcutaneous fat necrosis. It's often associated with pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, or pancreatic cyst. The patient's history of pancreatitis and the histopathological examination showing subcutaneous tissue with fibrosis, fat necrosis, and dense neutrophilic infiltration associated with fat necrosis could likely point to pancreatic panniculitis. Erythema nodosum, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis, and Polyarteritis nodosa have different histopathological features and are not usually associated with a history of pancreatitis.

B: Folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus

Explanation: The patient's presentation of hypopigmented, flat-topped, folliculocentric papules and their tendency to flare after stopping topical corticosteroids is characteristic of folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Lichen amyloidosis is usually associated with hyperpigmented, itchy, lichenoid papules and not hypopigmented ones. Guttate vitiligo typically presents with depigmentation rather than hypopigmentation and doesn't typically have the inflammatory component seen here. Eruptive tumors of the follicular infundibulum are typically benign and rare, without associated inflammation or pruritus. The dermoscopy findings and the histopathologic examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining provide further evidence supporting the diagnosis of folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

B: Branchio-oto-renal syndrome

Explanation: The Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is a disorder that typically involves the development of abnormalities in the structure of the neck, ears, and kidneys. The syndrome displays an autosomal dominant pattern in inheritance. Key clinical features that signify BOR syndrome in this 8-month-old boy include:

- The existence of preauricular pits are quite common in associations with the syndrome.
- Existence of a neck mass that drains clear fluid when the child feeds. This may represent a branchial cleft fistula.  
- Kidney abnormalities (small kidneys reported by the parent) often denote renal malformations or dysplasias. 
- Hearing disabilities at birth. Sensorineural, mixed or conductive hearing loss is often seen in BOR syndrome. 

Based on the presentation of these symptoms, the patient's diagnosis points towards BOR rather than the other options.

B: Hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis.

Explanation: The patient's abdominal pain, relative hypotension, coagulopathy due to the extended use of warfarin, and lowered hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggest an acute intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The computed tomography (CT) scan shows signs consistent with hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis - namely, the presence of gallstones and fluid in the abdomen, along with the blush of contrast in the gallbladder and surrounding hyperemia of the liver at the gallbladder fossa. These findings point to a perforation of the gallbladder due to the irascible gallstone, causing bleeding into the abdominal cavity and thus, hemorrhagic shock.

C: Subclavian steal syndrome

Explanation: The significant difference in blood pressure reading between the right and left arm, in addition to the diminished left radial pulse, suggests a vascular issue. Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when there is stenosis or blockage in the subclavian artery – the main blood vessel supplying blood to the arm. Due to the blockage, blood is 'stolen' from the the circle of Willis in the brain and directed towards the arm, resulting in ischemic symptoms like vertigo, syncope, or arm claudication. In this case, symptoms of left leg claudication and dyspnea on exertion might be secondary to reduced blood flow due to the 'stealing' of blood from the circle of Willis, which also supplies the spinal cord and lower body, by the left subclavian artery.

B: Pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid.

Explanation: Considering the specifics of the case, the most suitable approach seems to be Pars plana vitrectomy which serves a dual purpose of diagnostic and therapeutic action. The mentioned approach provides tissue for histopathological diagnosis and allows access for drainage of subretinal fluid. It is observed that staging and systemic evaluation, including computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) would be essential to determine the most suitable systemic therapy regime. Hence, option-B is deemed as the most probable solution considering the possible recovery from subretinal fluid accumulation contributing to vision decline. But the definite answer may vary according to detailed evaluations and physicians' specific recommendations.

C: Perform excisional biopsy. 

Explanation: Given the persistence of the lesion despite conservative management, and its unusual character (firm, nonvascular, and purulent in appearance), an excisional biopsy would be a helpful next step to identify the nature of the lesion. It could help rule out potential malignancy, infectious process, or granuloma. This would be especially important in the context of the patient's compromised immune status due to his rheumatoid arthritis and methotrexate use. Further histopathologic examination of the lesion might also guide the subsequent treatment plan.

A: Observe or perform laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion

Explanation: 

The patient's case indicates significant peripheral retinal avascularity and arteriovenous anastomoses without any sign of retinal neovascularization or recurrence of ROP, suggesting that the ROP has been effectively suppressed by the first treatment. While there are still angiographic abnormalities, these do not necessarily require further treatment unless they lead to recurring ROP or retinal neovascularization. Observation can monitor the patient's condition to see if further complications develop. Moreover, laser photocoagulation can be used to treat areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion if required. This non-invasive approach serves to lessen the likelihood of further complications that can come with other procedures like intravitreous injections. Therefore, the best next step would be to observe the patient and consider laser photocoagulation if necessary. Other treatment options like additional anti-VEGF therapy, combined therapy, or pars plana vitrectomy may incur unnecessary risks without concrete evidence of their necessity.

B: Biopsy orbital mass. 

Explanation: The case presents a challenging situation with an indeterminate ocular lesion and a medical history that does not provide clear evidence for the nature of the lesion. Further investigation is essential to determine its etiology and appropriate treatment. An eyeball mass identified on MRI scan that is not changing in size despite the patient's visual symptoms may need a biopsy for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. This would verify the nature of the ocular mass and thus guide the next course of treatment. Despite the visual symptoms resolving with changes in lighting and absence of any drastic changes in the MRI scans, the orbital mass needs to be thoroughly examined to rule out any malignancy or other harmful conditions. While observation, echocardiogram and Holter monitoring, or a hypercoagulability workup could potentially be useful, they are less likely to directly address the primary concern raised by the patient's symptoms and findings.

B: Genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles.

Explanation: The patient's case presentation of restrictive strabismus from birth, along with the MRI findings of enlarged extraocular muscles and the lack of improvement with propranolol treatment typically used for orbital capillary hemangioma suggest a different diagnosis. The restrictive strabismus could be due to fibrosis or hypertrophy of the extraocular muscles. Hence, genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM) is warranted. CFEOM affects the muscles that move the eye and is mainly congenital, appearing in infants as early birth, hence matching the patient's symptoms. While the investigations for systemic involvement, strabismus surgery, and orbital biopsy may also be necessary at some point, understanding the genetic implications could change the course of treatment. Therefore, the genetic testing is advisable as the next step.

C: Perform intraocular lens explantation, capsulectomy, and intravitreal vancomycin injection

Explanation: This patient's chronic postoperative inflammation after YAG capsulotomy, response to corticosteroids, and ultimately a culture positive for Propionibacterium acnes is suggestive of a chronic endophthalmitis. P. acnes is a gram positive, anaerobic bacterium commonly present on skin and in sebaceous glands. It has a tendency to produce a more insidious, chronic course of endophthalmitis due its ability to form biofilms and exist intracellularly after adherence to intraocular lenses. In such cases, the management primarily involves surgical removal of the infected lens and surrounding capsule (ie, explantation and capsulectomy), which allows for thorough debridement of the infecting organisms and any adherent biofilm. This is typically followed by intravitreal injection of antibiotics, such as vancomycin, based on susceptibilities.

C: Mycosis fungoides. 

Explanation: 
The patient's clinical features suggest a diagnosis of Mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that presents as patches, plaques, and tumors. The results from the second and third biopsy showing lymphoid infiltrate with epidermotropism are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the involvement of the scalp is a notable feature of this disease, and the gradual worsening of symptoms over months, despite changing medications and diagnosis of atypical lymphoid infiltrate, are in line with this diagnosis. The negative T-cell receptor gene rearrangement rules out processes characterized by a monoclonal T cell population, such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The other options (Lymphomatoid papulosis and Reactive lymphomatoid reaction) are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and biopsy results.

The fact that the patient's symptoms occur primarily at night, along with the sinus tachycardia during episodes of palpitation, may be indicative of a heart rhythm issue. 
The normal results from the patient's electrocardiogram and relatively normal left ventricular ejection fraction suggest the heart is functioning normally in most respects. Therefore, a conservative approach of medical management, such as lifestyle changes, risk factor modification and medication adjustment as needed, with re-evaluation of the case in 6 months via repeated transthoracic echocardiography, could be considered as the best option at this point.
In this situation, there is not enough concrete evidence to imply that a more aggressive intervention like transcatheter balloon mitral valvuloplasty, mitral valve repair and annuloplasty, or left atriotomy and membrane resection is needed. It would be better to reassess this patient's condition over time, given that his primary complaint is intermittent and not associated with severe structural abnormalities.
B: Salivary gland anlage tumor 

Explanation: A salivary gland anlage tumor (SGAT) is a rare benign congenital tumor of the nasopharynx in infants and small children. This diagnosis correlates with the patient's age, the site of the mass, the absence of other symptoms, and the histological findings of the mass. SGATs generally present with keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma, with small nests of primitive mesenchyme - as seen in the final pathological results. The tumor's vascularity, as well as the significant improvement following surgical removal, also supports this diagnosis. Dermoid, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hemangioma do not typically fit this clinical and pathological picture.

751
B: Sialolith

Explanation: The symptoms presented by the patient such as hard swelling, pain, and erythematous lesion are similar to those of a sialolith. A sialolith is a calcified mass or stone that forms within a salivary gland, usually in the duct of the submandibular gland (also known as the Wharton duct). They can lead to swelling, pain, and infection of the gland. The location of the swelling being adjacent to the maxillary first molar, an area through which the duct of the parotid gland (Stensen duct) opens, further supports this diagnosis. Given the presentation, it is less likely to be a mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which is a type of cancer, intraoral lipoma, a benign fatty growth, or unusual mucocele, a non-neoplastic salivary gland disorder. Of course, the definitive diagnosis would require further investigations including radiographic imaging or histo-pathological examinations.
B
752
C: Hypoglossal nerve schwannoma

Explanation: The clinical picture and immune-histochemical findings are suggestive of Hypoglossal nerve schwannoma. The size and location of the mass and the positive S100 stain all indicate a nerve sheath tumor, such as a schwannoma, which commonly affects the Hypoglossal nerve. In contrast, the chronic sialadenitis would generally not present with such a well-defined and firm mass nor would it show spindle cell neoplasm with positive staining for S100. A pleomorphic adenoma and chronic lymphadenitis would generally not demonstrate a positive S100 stain. The absence of malignancy also makes a Hypoglossal nerve schwannoma more likely.
C
753
C: Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma 

Explanation: Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare type of skin tumor that shares histopathological similarities with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but differs on crucial points. It usually presents in elderly patients, as clusters of large, epithelioid cells intermingled with reactive lymphocytes. In this case, the patient's age, the characteristics of the biopsy (large epithelioid cells, dense lymphocytic infiltrate), the expression of p16, EMA, p63, and CK903, and the absence of Epstein-Barr virus all suggest LELC. The negative molecular markers rule out other types of neoplasms. Negative otolaryngology examination and the absence of head or neck primary malignancy or nodal metastases make a nasopharyngeal origin less likely. Although the patient had an intestinal tumor, the differing histopathology (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma) suggests this is not the primary site for the cutaneous lesion. Ergo, a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is the most fitting.
C
754
D: Replace esomeprazole with nortriptyline.

Explanation: This patient’s normal endoscopic and histologic findings, along with a lack of response to PPI therapy, argue against GERD as the cause of her symptoms. Therefore, increasing the dose of her PPI (option A) or referring her for antireflux surgery (option C) would not be appropriate. A barium esophagogram (option B) would also not be helpful, as it has low sensitivity and specificity for GERD and would not likely change management. Instead, this patient's symptoms of postprandial retrosternal burning, lack of response to PPI therapy, normal EGD, and normal esophageal biopsies suggest functional heartburn (FH). The most effective treatment for FH is low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline (Option D), which can help reduce pain perception at the level of the central nervous system. Therefore, replacing esomeprazole with nortriptyline is the next best step in management for this patient.

B: Obtain a biopsy of the nodule. 

Explanation: 
The appearance of a new nodule in a patient with a history of ovarian cancer in itself is a sign that shouldn't be ignored. It could potentially be a sign of recurrent malignancy. Although the nodule's responsiveness to cleaning and antibiotics might suggest an infection or possible inflammation, the recurrent nature of the problem and the patient's past medical history suggest that a biopsy should be obtained to rule out malignancy. Furthermore, the rock hard nature of the nodule and unique friable plaque are also concerning features. Therefore, while the other options may also be worthwhile at different stages, at this point, the priority would be to obtain a biopsy of the nodule for histological and pathological examination.

C: Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth

Explanation: Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth (ALDY) typically presents as asymptomatic, annular, erythematous patches and plaques on the trunk and extremities, with sparing of the face and mucous membranes. It predominantly affects young individuals, commonly males, and its etiology is unknown. The clinical course of ALDY is chronic but benign and it is characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation. The histological features of ALDY include an interface dermatitis with vacuolar alteration of the basal cell layer, lichenoid infiltrate, and lymphocyte exocytosis, which were observed in this case.

757
C: Erythema induratum

Explanation: Erythema induratum (also known as nodular vasculitis or Bazin disease) should be suspected in this case. This disease is characterized by nodules and plaques that can ulcerate, primarily on the calves. This condition is more common in women and is often associated with a positive tuberculin skin test, suggesting an association with tuberculosis. Indeed, the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA via polymerase chain reaction in biopsy specimens from erythema induratum lesions has confirmed this association. However, erythema induratum can also be idiopathic or associated with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. Here, the patient’s origin from a country with a high TB prevalence and the chronic, recalcitrant course of her cutaneous disease further suggests erythema induratum over other types of nodular panniculitis such as erythema nodosum.

758
B: Prurigo pigmentosa

Explanation: Prurigo pigmentosa is a rare inflammatory dermatosis typically presenting as pruritic, erythematous papules that coalesce to form a reticulated pattern. This often resolves leaving a post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Although the precise etiology of prurigo pigmentosa remains unclear, it has been linked to ketosis. Histopathologically, prurigo pigmentosa is characterized by an interface dermatitis with neutrophilic exocytosis and dermal melanophages, all of which were shown in this patient's biopsy. It is distinguished from other dermatoses by its distribution, clinical course, and unique histopathology.

759
C: Germinoma

Explanation: The presence of progressively worsening symptoms and MRI findings of a growing lesion in the basal ganglia with unilateral hemiparesis suggest a possible CNS germinoma, particularly given the patient's age. Germinomas are a type of germ cell tumor that can occur in the brain, specifically in the midline structures such as the pineal and suprasellar regions. A characteristic feature of germinomas is their high signal intensity on T2 weighted MRI, with homogenous enhancement after gadolinium administration. In this case, the MRI showed a marked progression of lesions in the right basal ganglia and thalamus with high signal intensity, which could suggest a germinoma. Further, normal HCG levels in serum and CSF are consistent with the diagnosis of a germinoma, as these tumors are often associated with normal HCG levels. Gliomas, infarctions, and demyelinating disease would typically present with different clinical and radiological findings.

B: Waardenburg syndrome type 1

Explanation: The combination of sensorineural hearing loss, mid-facial features including displacement of the inner canthi, hypopigmented patch, and bright blue eyes are characteristic of Waardenburg syndrome. This syndrome is often diagnosed in early childhood and can be associated with deafness. Waardenburg syndrome is most commonly associated with mutations in the PAX3, MITF or SOX10 genes, but it can sometimes also be associated with mutations in other genes. Type 1 is distinguished by the presence of dystopia canthorum, a lateral displacement of the inner eye corners. The other options do not exhibit this particular symptom.

761
A: Ulcerative colitis flare

Explanation: The patient's clinical history and examinations are consistent with a severe flare of ulcerative colitis. The presence of severe abdominal pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, emesis, and an inflamed, obstructed colon with an intramural abscess all align with a severe flare of the condition. The patient was previously discharged for a UC flare that was being managed with prednisone, an immunosuppressant, further adding to the likelihood of recurrent flares, particularly if medication compliance or management was not optimal. While options B, C, and D could theoretically occur in a patient with UC, the clinical presentation and CT findings best match with a UC flare in this scenario.

762
A: Vitreous tap and inject 

Explanation: Given the patient’s presence of systemic candidiasis along with multiple creamy intraocular lesions and vitreous inflammation (vitritis), there is a high likelihood of having endogenous endophthalmitis, caused by the Candida spreading from the bloodstream into the eye. A vitreous tap allows the clinicians to confirm the diagnosis via culturing the vitreous fluid for Candida. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, an intravitreal injection of antifungal agents such as amphotericin B is the treatment of choice, and it should be done as soon as the diagnosis is suspected to preserve vision.

763
C: Repair canalicular lacerations and leave the foreign body in place.

Explanation: In a case where a bullet is lodged in the orbit without causing severe tissue damage or posing immediate threat to vision, the recommended approach is often to leave the foreign body in place. This is because attempting to remove it may pose greater risks due to potential damage to adjacent structures, like optic nerve or other orbital tissues during the retrieval process. The immediate concern, the large-angle alternating exotropia and the canalicular lacerations, should be addressed with reparative surgery. While obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study offers additional details about soft tissue damage, the clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan have already provided critical information for immediate management. Hence, option C would be a safer and more conservative approach to the case.
D
cellvalue empty
764
C: The best next step in management would be to review the patient's personal and family medical histories for hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases. This is because the clinical presentation of this young woman is suggestive of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), which may be secondary to a systemic condition causing a hypercoagulable state. Given her young age, use of oral contraceptive pills, and the absence of other traditional risk factors for RVO such as diabetes or hypertension it is important to look for other potential underlying causes. Conditions that could lead to a hypercoagulable state in a young woman could include pregnancy, genetic thrombophilias, autoimmune disorders, malignancies and the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives. Intravitreal corticosteroids or anti–vascular endothelial growth factors could be used to treat complications such as macular edema, but they would not address the root cause of this patient's condition. Panretinal photocoagulation may be used in cases of retinal neovascularization, which isn't present in this case.

765
C: Initiate rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapy

Explanation: The patient's history of cigarette use and alcohol dependence, symptoms of unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and cough with scant sputum, along with positive results for proteinase 3–antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and interferon γ release assay using QuantiFERON-TB gold (QFT) (Qiagen), all point towards a systemic disease such as tuberculosis. Furthermore, the chest computed tomography revealing tiny, scattered solid pulmonary nodules, despite them being too small to characterize, adds weight to this diagnosis. Despite the negative sputum culture and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacteria tuberculosis, it is possible that the patient is suffering from extrapulmonary tuberculosis. In this case, considering the potential irreversible ocular damage and systemic manifestations of vasculitis, it might be reasonable to initiate empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment with a RIPE regimen while awaiting further diagnostic confirmation. This would include rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The rest of the options do not address the potential cause and systemic concern. Therefore, this empirical approach could be the most beneficial for the patient's eye and systemic health.

766
D: Advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor.

Explanation: The diagnosis in this case is advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor, a rare and aggressive malignancy that frequently disseminates within the abdominopelvic region. Typically, this condition affects young adult males. The telltale feature of this disease is the EWS-WT1 fusion gene, which was positive in this patient as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This type of tumor also demonstrates immunoreactivity for desmin and cytokeratin as observed in this patient's histologic examination. Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, testicular carcinoma do not present with these specific genetic and immunohistochemical features.

767
C: Order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. 

Explanation: Based on the information, it seems that the patient's symptoms are suggestive of a potential structural heart disease which could be the root cause of her arrhythmias. While options A and B are valid in the context of ventricular tachycardia diagnosis and management, they may be less desirable if a structural or infiltrative heart disease is suspected. Invasive electrophysiology studies are helpful in patients where a distinct arrhythmic focus is suspected while implantable devices are more useful when frequent asymptomatic arrhythmias are anticipated. 

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option C) is a powerful tool to evaluate potential structural heart disease in patients with arrhythmias and unremarkable echocardiograms. It can offer detailed views of the heart that can aid in the diagnosis or rule out certain conditions such as sarcoidosis or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Lastly, a cardiac positron emission tomography (Option D) could be useful in the evaluation of metabolic activity in the heart, but would be most beneficial if an infiltrative process like sarcoidosis or a myocardial viability question were present. In the current scenario, this might not be the most suitable choice at this point.

Therefore, given the patient's history and symptoms, ordering a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging could provide crucial insight into her condition and direct appropriate management.

768
D: Cervical lymphatic malformation. 

Explanation: The imaging characteristics and the absence of prior trauma or infection strongly suggest a cervical lymphatic malformation, formerly known as a cystic hygroma. These are benign, congenital malformations of the lymphatic system, which most often present in infancy or early childhood, but can also present in adults. Often, they are asymptomatic unless they grow large enough to cause symptoms, as was the case in this patient. The slow, gradual growth; the location in the neck; and the radiographic appearance of a large, multi-lobulated cystic mass without solid, enhancing components or fluid levels suggest a lymphatic malformation rather than branchial cleft cyst, glomus tumor or liposarcoma.
D
769
B: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder

Explanation: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is the most likely diagnosis. This is a condition that can occur in individuals who have undergone organ transplantation. It is a result of immunosuppression, which allows for unchecked proliferation of lymphoid tissue. The commonly presented symptoms include fever, tonsillar erythema, swelling, and pain. Given the patient's history of recent bilateral lung transplantation, she would be taking immunosuppressive medications which could make her prone to this condition. Additionally, the multilocular hypodense collection extending from the nasopharynx to the right palatine tonsil as revealed by the computed tomographic scan contributes to this diagnosis. The new onset of symptoms and rapid worsening despite initial improvement following antibiotic treatment is also characteristic of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.
B
770
C: Fibrous dysplasia

Explanation: This case represents a polyostotic form of fibrous dysplasia described as craniofacial fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue. In this case, the patient demonstrates generalized radiopacities in the craniofacial skeleton which is a common characteristic of fibrous dysplasia. Moreover, the presence of multiple, slowly growing masses of the face and head reported since childhood also align with the diagnosis. The absence of abnormal calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, thyroid, and parathyroid hormone levels rules out the Paget disease of the bone, while the normal overlying skin and no involvement of other bones suggests against florid osseous dysplasia and Gardner syndrome.
C
771
A: Lipoblastoma

Explanation: The case involves a young, otherwise healthy boy presenting with left facial and eye pain accompanied by intermittent diplopia. Imaging revealed a well-circumscribed extraconal posterior-medial mass, inseparable from the medial rectus muscle. Biopsy and subsequent examination revealed that the tumor was negative for the FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene. This, along with the child's age, heavily points towards a lipoblastoma. Lipoblastomas are benign adipose tumors that primarily affect young children. The case does not exhibit the usual characteristics associated with liposarcoma, which are typically aggressive with high recurrence rates and often exhibit the FUS-CHOP fusion. Teratomas have a wide variety of presentations due to their nature of containing a variety of different cell types, and there is no definitive evidence to suggest the presence of multiple cell types in this case. Therefore, this case is most likely a lipoblastoma.
C
772
B: Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen 

Explanation: Given the presence of atypical spindled and epithelioid cells as identified through histopathological examination, it would be wise to further investigate the nature of these cells. Given that the patient's medical history includes kidney transplants and immunosuppressive therapy, there is a possibility that the patient may be dealing with a malignancy. The patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at higher risk for various infections and malignancies. Immunohistochemical analysis would aid in determining the source and nature of these cells. Also, considering the treatment history and the persisting symptoms, it would be suggested to get a comprehensive view of the situation before proceeding with other treatments or reassurance. Furthermore, cryotherapy and tissue culture may not be the best initial actions. Cryotherapy is not typically the initial treatment for nodules with atypical cells, and a tissue culture, while important to determine infection, may not address potential malignancy evidenced by the atypical cells.

Without the data from the mentioned Table 1, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the given clinical case, it would appear that option B: Replace heparin with argatroban for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia could be a possibility. 

Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) can occur as a side effect of Heparin, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Moreover, the presence of new thrombosis, despite the patient being on heparin, could indicate immune-mediated HIT where paradoxical thrombosis happens despite low platelet count. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor often used to manage HIT. Option B supports this potential diagnosis and related treatment.

Keep in mind, though, to interpret lab results and make a definitive decision, detailed lab data and additional patient information would be necessary. If he is also showing signs of antibiotic-induced thrombocytopenia then C could be a possibility. Moreover, the need to transfuse platelets should be based on platelet count, trends, and overall clinical condition which is not completely clear from this data.

Please consult the patient's health providers for the final interpretation and decision.

C: Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis

Explanation: The presence of intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies, as well as the character of the ulcer and hypopigmented macules, suggest Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). PKDL is a complication of visceral leishmaniasis and is endemic to India. It's characterized by non-healing ulcers and various skin lesions, notably hypopigmented macules, and is often mistaken for leprosy due to the dermatological manifestations. The failure of multi-drug therapy treatment for leprosy further supports this diagnosis. The patient's demographic and geographic origin further support PKDL as the most likely diagnosis. The diagnosis would be confirmed by identifying Leishmania donovani bodies in the biopsy material from the lesion.

C: Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy

Explanation: Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a rare, idiopathic microangiopathy that presents as widespread, blanchable, telangiectatic macules predominantly involving the lower extremities. This condition is characterized by the deposition of hyaline material around dermal blood vessels, as observed in this patient's biopsy results. The absence of systemic symptoms, the confinement of the lesion to one extremity, and the results of the biopsy strongly suggest this diagnosis. The other options (A: Essential telangiectasia, B: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis, D: Pigmented purpuric dermatosis, Schamberg type) do not fit as well with the patient's clinical presentation and histologic findings.
C

B: Brown tumor

Explanation: The patient's presented symptoms and medical history indicate a case of Brown tumor. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (as noted in this patient) can develop these tumors. Brown tumors are a rare manifestation of hyperparathyroidism, characterized by abnormal bone metabolism. The tumor's histopathology showing giant multinucleated cells and the patient's lab results showing hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone further support this diagnosis. The complete lysis of the phalanx and the major deformation of the ribs shown in radiographs are severe complications associated with untreated hyperparathyroidism and Brown tumors. Therefore, the best fitting diagnosis in this context is a Brown tumor.

C: Monilethrix. 

Explanation: Monilethrix is a rare, autosomal dominant hair disorder characterized by beaded or moniliform hair shafts leading to hair fragility and patchy dystrophic alopecia. The condition often manifests in the first few months of life, following the replacement of lanugo (fine, downy) hair. Examination may demonstrate follicular hyperkeratosis, keratotic papules, and perifollicular erythema, all signs of this condition. Hair microscopy reveals the pathognomonic 'beaded' appearance, a result of alternating nodes and internodes along the hair shaft. The hereditary nature of the disorder is reflected in the patient's family history. Other considerations such as Tinea capitis and psoriasis tend to produce inflammatory or infectious scalp symptoms, and Menkes disease, a disorder of copper metabolism, is often accompanied by neurological deficits and connective tissue disorders.

C: Intramural small bowel hematoma. 

Explanation: The given history of a handlebar injury and localized left abdominal pain along with unique CT scan findings showing bowel loop with thickened wall point towards an intramural small bowel hematoma. This is an injury often associated with direct blunt abdominal trauma such as a handlebar injury. Although the child's initial vital signs and laboratory results were normal, the persistent vomiting, especially after oral intake, further aligns with this diagnosis. Other options like abdominal wall hematoma or traumatic pancreatic injury would likely present with differing symptoms, signs, and imaging results. Small bowel perforation is less likely given the absence of free abdominal fluid in the ultrasound imaging.

A: Acute appendicitis 

Explanation: The clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings suggest acute appendicitis. The patient's symptoms, physical exam with right lower quadrant pain and tenderness, leukocyte count, and imaging are consistent with appendicitis. Amoxicillin clavulanate was given for initial conservative treatment but the pain recurred. The MRI confirmed inflammation and thickening of the appendix, which further supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

780
D

Explanation: The examination points to a diagnosis of West Nile Virus Chorioretinitis, a condition associated with West Nile Virus (WNV) infection. The WNV can cause uveitis and chorioretinitis. In this patient, characteristic white chorioretinal lesions, serological proof of recent WNV infection and the absence of vitritis helped in the diagnosis. Therefore, the most suitable management option is watchful observation (D), as she has no other alarming symptoms and her vision is not at risk currently. Options A, B, and C (a vitreous biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, or a biopsy of the chorioretinal lesion) may unnecessarily expose the patient to the risks and costs of these procedures without an anticipated change in management at this time.
C: Order magnetic resonance imaging for the orbits and brain

Explanation: Given the rapid progression of the patient's symptoms, the involvement of multiple cranial nerves, and the history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and stem cell transplant, it is crucial to quickly assess for central nervous system (CNS) involvement. MRI of the orbits and brain would provide valuable information about possible infiltration or CNS relapse, which is a known complication in patients with a history of lymphoblastic lymphoma. This non-invasive procedure provides a comprehensive view of brain structures and can help to exclude differential diagnosis like inflammation, infection, or other causes of her symptoms. While a lumbar puncture could yield useful information, it is more invasive and carries its own risks. Observation alone could lead to significant delays in necessary treatment, and optic nerve decompression is a more invasive surgical option that wouldn't be considered until imaging was completed and other causes were ruled out.

D: Order visual field testing and observe closely for serous macular detachment

Explanation: In this case, the woman has a peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation, its location and associated features on OCT images, together with the absence of symptoms, are consistent with this diagnosis. This condition is characteristic in patients with myopia and peripapillary atrophy, and is usually asymptomatic. It is therefore important to monitor these patients with periodic OCT and visual field tests to assess for the development of serous macular detachment, rather than pursuing aggressive intervention options such as magnetic resonance imaging, laser barricade, or photodynamic therapy. Additionally, this condition does not usually extend beyond the peripapillary region, making indocyanine green angiography unnecessary. Therefore, a conservative approach of visual field testing and observation is most appropriate in this case.

783
C: Perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start intravenous antibiotics. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical situation suggests an infection, possibly necrotizing scleritis which can occur as a rare complication after transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Necrotizing scleritis is an aggressive, destructive form of inflammation that can lead to pain, redness, and a distinct lesion as described in this patient. Immediate surgical exploration can help in diagnosing and treating this potentially sight-threatening condition. Culture and biopsy of the lesion during surgery would provide definitive diagnosis which will help in tailoring the antibiotic coverage. Intravenous antibiotics would be most effective in this situation due to the severity of the potential infection. Systemic steroids are not the first line of treatment in this case because it has the potential to exacerbate an infectious process. Therefore, antibiotics are preferred over steroids until an infectious etiology has been ruled out.

B: Primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC

Explanation: Given the patient history of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC and the results of the Positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealing unexpected, prominent, metabolic activity in the medial and asymmetrically enlarged left vocal cord, the most likely diagnosis is a primary laryngeal carcinoma. The patient's history of tobacco use, recurrent oral cancer, and total thyroidectomy due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury also support this diagnosis. While metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, inflammatory reaction, and postradiation change are also possibilities, the focused metabolic activity in the left vocal cord is more indicative of a primary laryngeal carcinoma. Furthermore, metastasis to the vocal cord is rather unusual, and though the hypermetabolic activity could be indicative of inflammation or postradiation change, the asymmetric enlargement of the vocal cord is more suggestive of a primary carcinoma.

D: Genetic testing. 

Explanation: The combination of dyspnea on exertion, swelling of the lower extremities, progressive muscle weakness, a family history of congestive heart failure, and cardiac abnormalities in a young individual suggests familial dilated cardiomyopathy, a genetic disorder that primarily affects the heart muscle leading to heart failure. Elevated levels of creatine kinase and the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase could also be indicative of skeletal muscle disease or dysfunction. Given the strong familial indication, a genetic test would be the most sensible next step to confirm a diagnose of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle disease.

D: Myopericytoma

Explanation: Myopericytomas are rare, benign tumours with perivascular myoid differentiation and are characterized by a concentric, perivascular growth pattern. The histological features described, including the round, syncytial cells arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized, slit-like vascular spaces, as well as the strong immunohistochemical positive staining for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and muscle-specific actin are indicative of a myopericytoma. Additionally, myopericytomas can occur in the nasal septum, which fits with this patient's presentation. The other listed diagnoses can be mostly excluded by either the described histopathology or the immunohistochemistry results.
D
787
C: Small-cell carcinoma
Explanation: The histopathological findings of sheets and clusters of small round-oval uniform cells with minimal cytoplasm, granular chromatin pattern, and prominent nuclear molding are characteristic of small cell carcinoma. This is also supported by the high mitotic rate, and the fact that the cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 and synaptophysin, but negative for cytokeratin 5 and 6, cytokeratin 20, NUT, p63, and chromogranin. Furthermore, small cell carcinomas can be associated with HPV, as evidenced by the presence of HPV 16 DNA in this case.
C
788
C: Intradiploic meningoencephalocele 

Explanation:
The imaging indicates a lesion with a signal isointense to the cerebrospinal fluid, along with thinning of the bony cortex and herniation of nonenhancing meninges, which aligns with symptoms of an Intradiploic meningoencephalocele, a herniation of the meninges and/or brain parenchyma into the diploic space of the skull bone. The clear nasal discharge suggests a CSF rhinorrhea, another symptom compatible with this disease. 

Unfortunately, the renowned conditions under options A, B, and D (Multiple Myeloma, Paget disease, and Fibrous Dysplasia respectively), do not typically cause such symptoms. Additionally, the imaging findings are not typically associated with these diseases. Thus leaving option C to make the best sense based on provided information.
C
789
C

Explanation: The patient's physical features, including fair skin, platinum hair, blue eyes, and congenital nystagmus, are associated with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). The poor vision and photophobia experienced since childhood suggest a diagnosis of OCA. While molecular genetic testing (B) could confirm this diagnosis, understanding whether the patient has a history of frequent infections or abnormal bleeding (C) could provide additional clues. If the patient has these histories, this could suggest Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), characterized by OCA and bleeding diathesis due to a platelet storage pool deficiency, and/or Chédiak-Higashi syndrome characterized by OCA and recurrent infections due to immune defects. Additionally, patients with HPS are at an increased risk of developing specific types of lung and bowel disease. Dilated ophthalmic examination (A) could be useful but would mainly confirm what is already suspected based on the patient's reported symptoms and physical features. Counseling to avoid sun exposure (D) would be important but the priority is to further investigate the potential cause of the patient's symptoms.
B: Biopsy the lesion. 

Explanation: The detailed case summary presents an unusual lesion that is growing rapidly, ulcerated, and causing discomfort. Furthermore, the patient lacks signs of infection such as fever, erythema, edema, and lymphadenopathy that would suggest bacterial abscess formation (requiring drainage) or inflammatory processes (which would respond to anti-inflammatory agents). Therefore, incision and drainage (Option A) or prescribing an anti-inflammatory agent (Option C) would not be the most appropriate action at this point. A touch preparation (Option D) is typically not the first step in evaluating a nodule. Hence, the most appropriate step is to perform a biopsy (Option B) to allow for histological examination of the lesion and reach a definitive diagnosis. It enables identification of potential malignant cells or granulomatous diseases.

791
C: Granuloma annulare

Explanation: The clinical and histologic findings are most consistent with granuloma annulare. The appearance of annular plaques with central clearing and trailing scale are typical of this condition. Furthermore, the histopathologic examination showing a perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate is characteristic of granuloma annulare. While erythema annulare centrifugum and interstitial granulomatous dermatitis may also present with annular plaques, the key histologic findings favor granuloma annulare. Leukemia cutis is less likely due to the absence of other systemic symptoms of leukemia and the specific presentation and localization of the rash.

C: Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption

Explanation: The concurrent photo-distributed, violaceous, atrophic plaques on the patient's dorsal hands and forearms and mechanic's hands–type lesions, along with a drug-induced, dermatomyositis-like eruption and a lower leg ulcer suggests a hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption. This is a rare side effect of hydroxyurea, a medication often used for conditions like essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and chronic myeloid leukemia. The leg ulcer further supports this diagnosis as hydroxyurea has been associated with mucocutaneous ulcers. The other options are less likely due to the absence of associated symptoms or failure to account for all of the patient's cutaneous findings.

D: Sneddon syndrome. 

Explanation: Sneddon syndrome is a rare noninflammatory thrombotic vasculopathy characterized by the association of generalized livedo racemosa (GLR) and stroke. In this case, the presence of GLR (shown as a net-like erythema), history of multiple strokes, normal inflammatory markers, and negative vasculitis/autoimmune workup all contribute to this diagnosis. Furthermore, absence of telangiectasia or oculomotor apraxia also rules out Ataxia-telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome), while the negative antinuclear antibodies and complement C3 and C4 levels rule out Systemic lupus erythematosus, and Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita is unlikely due to the late onset of symptoms and the absence of congenital skin lesions. This leaves Sneddon syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.

C: Autoimmune encephalitis. 

Explanation: 
The recurrent episodes of focal neurological deficits along with the MRI findings of recurrent inflammation in different areas of the nervous system suggest an autoimmune process. Additionally, the temporal dispersion of the symptoms and remission following corticosteroid therapy align with autoimmune encephalitis. The absence of oligoclonal bands and normal IgG index make multiple sclerosis less likely. Central nervous system lymphoma is less likely given the absence of malignancy on the CSF cytologic tests. Neurosarcoidosis is also less likely given the lack of other systemic symptoms, organ involvement and the CSF profile.

B: Melanoma

Explanation: The patient's changing skin lesion, along with the development of new black spots within it, are classic signs of melanoma. This is further supported by the patient's family history of melanoma and dysplastic nevus syndrome. The patient's lesion initially being a stable red lesion also suggests it could have originated from a dysplastic nevus, which are known to have a higher risk of transforming into melanoma. The drastic change in morphology, a key feature of melanoma, observed in a subsequent visit is additional evidence supporting this diagnosis.

796
C: Carcinoma

Explanation: While male breast cancer is less common, it is still a possible diagnosis, especially considering the physical examination findings and imaging results in this case. The patient's nodule was hard, irregular, and mobile, which are characteristic features of carcinomas. It was also tethered to the overlying skin, yet not fixed to the underlying muscle. These factors, along with the involvement of skin but not the pectoralis muscle, as visible on the CT scan, are indicative of invasive carcinoma. Though the patient doesn't have a family history of breast or ovarian cancers, this does not rule out the possibility of a carcinoma. Gynecomastia is less likely due to the localized nature of the mass and absence of hypogonadism signs. Lipomas are typically soft, not hard. Epidermal inclusion cysts usually present with an overlying punctum and are not usually tender unless infected. Hence, carcinoma (option C) is the most likely diagnosis.

C: Mesenteric venous thrombosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of severe abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting, combined with imaging indicating significant mesenteric edema and hypoenhancing bowel walls, suggest ischemia related to mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). MVT can lead to compromised blood flow and subsequent ischemia due to clot formation in the mesenteric vein. Given laboratory findings that indicated sodium concentration of 126 mEq/L, significantly elevated lactate concentration of 58.6 mg/dL suggesting possible lactic acidosis from poor tissue perfusion, and white blood cell count of 18 500/μL reflecting a likely inflammatory response to ischemic insult, MVT appears to be the most probable diagnosis.

Option B: Probe with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system. 

Explanation: Despite significant resolution of clinical findings after antibiotic therapy and percutaneous needle drainage, it is important to perform a probing with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system. This should ideally be done under anesthesia because it can help to confirm the presence of nasolacrimal duct obstruction and also provide a pathway for tear flow, which helps to prevent recurrence of dacryocystitis. 
While transitioning to oral antibiotics and discharge (option A) might be considered once an acute infection has been controlled, it would not address underlying structural issues that led to dacryocystitis in the first place, leaving a high risk for recurrence. Similarly, lacrimal sac digital massage (option C) can help in promoting drainage but does not address the underlying duct obstruction. 
Lastly, it should be noted that endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization (option D) often reserve for resistant and recurrent cases of dacryocystitis and those with failed probing. Moreover, this option is invasive, requires general anesthesia, and does not necessarily ensure the prevention of subsequent dacryocystitis. Therefore, probing with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system is crucial for comprehensive management in this situation.

A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient, characterized by headaches, visual symptoms, abnormalities on brain MRI, and the observed fundus changes, suggests raised intracranial pressure. Lumbar puncture is a diagnostic procedure that can confirm raised intracranial pressure and also allow for cerebrospinal fluid analysis which could reveal other underlying conditions. Therefore, ordering a lumbar puncture (Option A) would be the next best step in this patient's management.
C

Explanation: Given the patient's previous medical history, and her current symptoms inclusive of blurry vision and recent Bell palsy, it is important to rule out possible correlation with neurologic abnormalities or an underlying disease of the central nervous system. Hence, the ideal course of action would appear to be Option C - Order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture for further diagnosis and treatment planning. This patient's worsening visual acuity despite improvement of her Bell's palsy is of concern and warrants more detailed investigation. Prednisone taper would be considered if there is an inflammation suspected, and an anti-VEGF would be administered in case of suspected vessel abnormality which is not evident here. Infectious and inflammatory workup would be considered in condition related to infections or inflammation, however nothing as such is indicated here. Thus, brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture seems to be the best fit here.
B: Perform echocardiography and administer intravenous immunoglobulin

Explanation: This case is suggestive of Kawasaki disease, a condition that often involves mucocutaneous symptoms such as a rash and bilateral conjunctivitis as well as fever lasting for more than 5 days. This condition can also involve the coronary arteries and may cause aneurysms, hence the need to perform echocardiography to check for any heart involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin is the treatment of choice for Kawasaki disease to reduce the risk of coronary artery abnormalities. The other choices do not target the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms or are less safe compared to this option. Option A is not the best choice as corticosteroid eyedrops would only target the eye symptoms and not the underlying Kawasaki disease. Option C is also not ideal as a Tzanck smear is typically used to diagnose herpes virus infections which does not fit this case. Option D could be useful to prevent spread of any possible infectious agent, however it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B: Spontaneous perinephric hematoma

Explanation: The patient’s sudden onset of severe pain, hypotension and anemia are consistent with a large bleed. An abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (Option A) can cause this presentation, but imaging would show an enlarged, ruptured aorta which is not described here. A splenic rupture (Option C) could similarly cause this, but the left renal angle tenderness suggests kidney-related phenomena such as perinephric hematoma rather than splenic pathology. Pyelonephritis (Option D) is unlikely to cause such severe acute symptoms without concurrent fever or urinary symptoms. Given the patient's medication history, she was taking ibrutinib, a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, which can predispose to bleeding events by affecting platelet function. Therefore, a spontaneous perinephric hematoma (Option B) is a plausible diagnosis that agrees with her symptoms, clinical findings, and medication history.

803
D: Initiate chemotherapy (erlotinib).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, such as the presence of multiple systemic emboli, lung adenocarcinoma, and metastases on the vertebral and dura, combined with the appearance of large, mobile masses on the mitral and tricuspid leaflets suggest tumoral involvement. This could likely be Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE), also known as marantic endocarditis, which is characterized by sterile vegetations on valve leaflets and is predominantly seen in patients with malignancies. The treatment of choice in NBTE is the treatment of the underlying cause—in this case, the lung adenocarcinoma. Erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can be used in chosen patients with lung adenocarcinoma to target the cancer cells. This treatment can potentially reduce the risk of additional emboli. As such, other options such as broad-spectrum antibiotics or valve replacement are not the most suitable choices given the current patient's diagnosis and clinical manifestations. Full-dose anticoagulation therapy could be a choice if there were a clot, but as the vegetations in NBTE are known for poorly adhering to the valves, there's a risk they might be dislodged and cause further emboli, complicating the patient's condition. Thus, treating the root cause, the cancer, with chemotherapy, appears the most logical and beneficial choice.

A: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma 

Explanation: 
Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, a recently described entity, is characterized by dual differentiation: myogenic and neural, similar to the myoepithelial tumors of the salivary glands. The tumor's clinical presentation typically includes unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and rhinorrhea, much like the presentation of our patient. On physical examination, a mass is usually seen arising from the lateral nasal wall. The tumor is composed of spindle cells arranged in short and long fascicles or storiform pattern, consistent with the pathology in this case. It tends to express actin and S-100 protein, as observed in this patient. The other options were considered, however, the location of the tumor, clinical symptoms, histologic findings, and immunophenotype are decisive for the diagnosis of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.
A
805
B: Infectious pseudotumor

Explanation: The boy's history, physical examination findings and histopathologic images suggesting granulomata with central necrosis are consistent with an infectious pseudotumor. Infectious pseudotumors are benign lesions that can appear aggressive on imaging and histopathology, which may make them difficult to distinguish from malignant neoplasms. They are often composed of both granulomatous and necrotic tissue, which fits the pathology findings in this case. The lack of fevers or other constitutional symptoms may suggest against an active infection, but these are not always present, particularly in more chronic cases. Furthermore, the boy's history of chronic otitis media could suggest a recurrent or persistent source of infection leading to the pseudotumor. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis do not generally cause granulomata with central necrosis. Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is considered less likely given the presenting symptoms and pathology findings.
B
806
C: Subglottic stenosis

Explanation: The patient's history of prolonged intubation along with symptoms of noisy breathing, stridor, choking, irritability and poor feeding suggest airway obstruction. The inability to effectively manage his symptoms using racemic epinephrine, albuterol, and steroids, point to a structural issue rather than a reactive one. His presentation of a weak cry and biphasic stridor are important hallmarks of upper airway obstruction. During sedation, observation of a prolonged expiratory phase suggests a fixed obstruction in the lower airway. In the context of a prolonged intubation, subglottic stenosis, which can be an acquired condition resulting from injury to the airway via intubation, is a probable diagnosis. Although laryngotracheitis (croup), subglottic cyst, and subglottic hemangioma could produce similar symptoms, the patient's history and presentation are most consistent with subglottic stenosis.
B
807
B: Cutaneous malakoplakia

Explanation: Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare granulomatous disorder often associated with immunosuppressed states. It frequently presents as yellow-brown plaques or nodules in the anogenital region. In this case, the patient's history of prostate cancer and use of various medications like alprazolam could possibly suggest an immunosuppressed state. The fact that the nodules developed after the treatment of the intertrigo and their symmetry in the inguinal folds adjacent to the scrotum, further supports the diagnosis of Cutaneous malakoplakia. Additionally, the erythematous nature of the lesions could be indicative of inflammation or infection, which is why malakoplakia - an inflammatory condition - is a suitable diagnosis.

C: Secondary syphilis

Explanation: The presence of diverse morphologic manifestations such as annular, corymbiform and papulosquamous lesions are characteristic of secondary syphilis. Additionally, the presence of a rash on the soles of the feet and the lack of involvement of the palms and genital area also support this diagnosis. Primary syphilis usually presents as a single painless chancre, most often on the genitals, rectum, or mouth, whereas secondary syphilis can produce a range of symptoms including skin rashes and a sore throat. It's alo worth noting that the patient had remained asymptomatic and the failure to respond to high-potency topical corticosteroids treatment. The diagnosis of syphilis can be confirmed by serologic testing. T-cell lymphoma, lupus erythematosus and psoriasis present differently and don’t typically show this wide morphological variety in their skin manifestations. This case underscores the diversity of dermatological manifestations secondary syphilis can show, earning its nickname as "the great imitator".

809
B: Subcutaneous sarcoidosis

Explanation: This patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with subcutaneous sarcoidosis, a rare form of cutaneous sarcoidosis. The presence of nonulcerated, nonpainful nodules distributed in a sporotrichoid-like pattern and histopathological features without significant peripheral inflammatory cell infiltrate ("naked granulomas") are consistent with this diagnosis. The hilar lymphadenopathy seen on his chest CT also points towards sarcoidosis, which is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organ systems. The negative results for fungal and mycobacterial stains, as well as the lack of response to antifungal treatment, make sporotrichosis unlikely. Tumoral calcinosis typically presents with hyperphosphatemia, and erythema nodosum shows a strong predominance of neutrophils on histology, both of which were not evident in this patient. Additionally, this patient's medications and other medical conditions do not suggest drug-induced or metabolic causes for his skin nodules. We can therefore conclude that subcutaneous sarcoidosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

B: Vitamin A deficiency

Explanation: The child's symptoms of night blindness, dry eyes, and corneal changes, along with a restrictive diet, all point to a vitamin A deficiency. This condition, also referred to as xerophthalmia, can lead to corneal xerosis (dryness), keratomalacia (corneal necrosis/ulceration), and Bitot's spots (dry, keratinized patches) which are distinctive signs of vitamin A deficiency. Glaucoma typically presents with pain and doesn't typically lead to total vision loss at this age. Sjögren syndrome is less likely given the absence of other systemic symptoms and bilateral cataracts would not account for the Bitot's spots and wouldn't occur at this young age without a significant trauma or genetic disorder.

B: Acute appendicitis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, leukocytosis, increased C-reactive protein level and the CT scan findings of an inflammatory mass all point towards a case of acute appendicitis. Appendicitis would lead to localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and it can cause systemic symptoms such as fever and tachycardia. White blood cell count can be elevated in response to inflammation and infection, and C-reactive protein is an acute phase reactant that can be elevated in inflammatory conditions, including appendicitis.

C: Lupus enteritis

Explanation: The severe acute abdominal pain disproportionate to clinical findings, the lack of abnormal laboratory test results, and the progressive thickening of the small bowel seen in the images are classically associated with lupus enteritis. This is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus that can manifest with severe acute abdominal pain. This can be diagnosed with computed tomography showing concentric bowel wall edema as in this case. Superior mesenteric artery and vein thrombosis/embolism usually present with an acute abdomen and findings of ischemia. The more generalized involvement, and the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, make lupus enteritis more probable in this case.

813
C: Counsel the patient on the prognosis of his condition

Explanation: Given the observation of profound vision loss with no light perception, nonreactive dilated pupils, and diffuse, bilateral optic disc pallor in a patient who had a traumatic injury with profound hypotension and anemia, the likely diagnosis is bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy. Bilateral cases are often associated with severe systemic hypotension, and as in this case, it is not unusual for the diagnosis to be delayed because patients may be sedated and intubated in the ICU for days to weeks following their index event. The time of onset of vision loss is often difficult to pin down in this setting because patients may have been unconscious or sedated. Vision loss from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, the form involving the disc, is usually severe at onset and is often but not always associated with optic disc edema, which is typically absent by the time of eye examination in cases with delayed diagnosis. Unfortunately, no effective treatments are currently available, and visual recovery, if any, is usually minimal. Therefore, the best step to undertake next is to counsel the patient regarding the prognosis of his condition.

B: Prescribe analgesia to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia and refer the patient to a neurologist.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of facial numbness and eye pain, along with findings of reduced sensation in the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the right trigeminal nerve, are suggestive of atypical trigeminal neuralgia. This condition, while rare, can present with similar symptoms and can occur de novo or secondary to other pathologies such as herpes zoster, trauma, or other neurological disorders. Standard imaging such as CT or MRI of the brain might not necessarily detect this condition. So, the priority would be managing the patient's pain and referring him to a neurologist for further investigation and management. Atypical trigeminal neuralgia is a primarily clinical diagnosis and can be extremely debilitating for patients, therefore symptomatic treatment and specialist referral should not be delayed.

D: Discuss carefully observing vs surgical repair of the ptosis.

Explanation: The patient's condition suggests Congenital Ptosis which is typically managed by surgery when it impacts visual development or for cosmetic reasons. The decision to operate depends on various factors such as the degree of ptosis and its interference with visual development. Non-surgical management, such as careful observation, may be appropriate if the ptosis is mild and does not hinder vision. However, the child's significantly reduced palpebral fissure height and margin reflex distance of the left eye indicate a potential need for surgical intervention which should be underlined during consultation with family. The absence of neurologic symptoms, developmental delay, or systemic illness deems options of conducting genetic testing (A), performing urgent neuroimaging (B), or starting oral corticosteroids (C) less applicable in this case.

C: Incisional biopsy.

Explanation: The choice of treatment in this case is largely dependent on determining the nature of the orbital mass. An excisional biopsy might be premature if the mass is malignant, as this could lead to dissemination of cancerous cells. Starting chemotherapy without biopsy confirmation is not advisable either. Corticosteroids may reduce inflammation but would not likely aid in diagnosing the mass. In the present scenario, an incisional biopsy would afford the opportunity to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological examination thereby enabling a more ordered treatment pathway based on the biopsy findings. The results of the biopsy can guide the decision whether surgery, chemotherapy, or possibly radiotherapy is the most prudent subsequent step.

D: Therapeutic monoclonal antibody at serum concentration detectable by SPEP-IF.

Explanation: The emergence of a new monoclonal protein (M-protein) in a patient receiving monoclonal antibody therapy such as Elotuzumab can suggest the presence of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody at serum concentration detectable by SPEP-IF. This is a common occurrence in clinical practice as the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies can be detected by laboratory tests such as SPEP and IF. Hence, the new M-IgG κ band could be the elotuzumab itself, a humanized IgG1 κ monoclonal antibody. Moreover, if the patient had another emerging clone or a B-cell disorder, one would expect an increase in the serum free light chain (FLC) ratio, whereas in this case, the FLC ratio normalized. The reduction in the original M-IgA κ and the improvement in the patient's clinical state further support that the new protein was therapeutic, not a result of disease progression or a new disease.

818
C: Order 30-day event monitoring

Explanation: The patient's key problem is unheralded syncope. The workup for syncope should be guided by the history and physical examination. In this case, the initial evaluation provides evidence of bradyarrhythmia, with sinus bradycardia and lower-than-normal heart rate, but does not reveal an etiology. Although the patient also has interventricular block, it is relatively stable and did not result in chronic third-degree block or recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmia on testing. Temporary or permanent pacing can be considered if symptoms recur and are thought to be due to bradycardia. Since his CMRI and exercise stress test showed no ischemia or structural abnormalities, coronary angiography is unlikely to be helpful. FDG-PET could be used to screen for sarcoidosis or other infiltrative diseases; however, there are no clinical, ECG, or imaging findings suggestive of these conditions in this case. Hence a 30-day event monitoring is suggested as the most reasonable next step in this case to further evaluate the cause of his bradycardia and syncope. This would document the frequency and duration of pauses, symptomatic periods, and possible correlation with bradyarrhythmia.

B: Discontinue antibiotic therapy and consider systemic corticosteroids

Explanation: This case exemplifies a clinical picture of fever, erythematous rash, diarrhea, and pulmonary infiltrates after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is suggestive of acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). In acute GVHD, the donor's T cells react to the human leukocyte antigen differences in the transplant recipient, leading to activation of donor T cells and causing inflammation and tissue damage. Acute GVHD typically presents within the first 100 days posttransplant and initially manifests as a rash that may progress to involve the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Weight gain as seen in the case patient could be an indication of fluid retention, another common feature of acute GVHD, due to capillary leak syndrome. Given the absence of microbiological evidence pointing towards an infection, as well as the correlating onset of symptoms with neutrophil recovery, considering GVHD is reasonable. Treatment usually involves discontinuation of any potential offending medications and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Hence, option B is the most appropriate next step in this case.

A: The patient is taking methadone and morphine.

Explanation: The urine drug screen revealed the presence of methadone, morphine, and their metabolites. Methadone, a synthetic opioid, is prescribed for pain management and can be detected in urine for 2 to 7 days after use. Morphine, another opioid used for pain management, is also detected in this patient’s urine. It's also important to know that hydromorphone can be a metabolite of morphine which means the patient may not be directly taking it. Codeine wasn't mentioned in the patient's prescription list, and its presence might be due to a laboratory identification error or uncertainty.

B: Scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA

Explanation: The patient was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and was commenced on treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and idarubicin. Subsequently, he developed pyrexia and tender black spots on the scrotum that progressed to painful ulcers, and despite additional antifungal and antiviral therapy, there was no improvement. Cultures failed to grow any bacterial or viral infections and there was no abscess seen on ultrasonography. The progression of scrotal ulceration coincided with recovery in neutrophil count and persistent fever. All these factors point to the likelihood of scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA as being the culprit for the patient's symptoms. Induction chemotherapy with ATRA has been previously reported to cause scrotal ulceration and is therefore the most likely diagnosis given the presentation and the patient's history.

B: Malignant atrophic papulosis

Explanation: The clinical features and biopsy results of the patient suggest Malignant Atrophic Papulosis (MAP), also known as Degos disease. The distinctive skin lesions with whitish atrophic centers and erythematous halos, along with the systemic involvement manifesting as bowel perforations, are characteristic of MAP. Histological findings including wedge-shaped avascular necrosis in dermis, occlusion of dermal blood vessels, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and mucin deposition further support the diagnosis. Other options like pancreatitis panniculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphomatoid papulosis don't fully align with the patient's signs, symptoms and biopsy findings.

C: Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical and histopathological features, BP is initially highly suspected; however, the absence of circulating anti-BP180 antibodies makes this diagnosis unlikely. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita typically present with scarring and milia, conditions which this patient does not exhibit. Linear IgA dermatosis generally demonstrates a band-like distribution of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction, a feature which is not reported in this case. Therefore, Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is the most probable diagnosis due to the subepidermal blisters, absence of mucosal involvement and scarring, negativity for BP180 antibodies, and the patient's response to corticosteroid treatment.

C: Muckle-Wells syndrome

Explanation: The Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), also known as Urticaria-deafness-amyloidosis (UDA), is a rare autosomal dominant disease which causes an abnormal inflammatory response to cold or other stimuli. This syndrome, also classified as one of the Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), is characterized by recurrent fever, urticaria-like rash, arthralgia, conjunctivitis and progressive sensorineural deafness. The symptoms presented by the girl are indicative of MWS. Her reaction to anti-histamines is typical, as urticarial rash in MWS does not respond to these, signifying an auto-inflammatory etiology rather than allergic one. Also, the recurrent fever and the absence of infectious cause also align with MWS. While Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder could be considered, the age of onset and the type of symptoms present (bilateral conjunctivitis, arthralgias) suggest Muckle-Wells syndrome as the more likely diagnosis. Chronic urticaria is less likely due to the periodic fever and other systemic symptoms accompanying the rash.

D: Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and absence of a pulse coupled with imaging results indicating a heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow are indicative of a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm. Extensive deep vein thrombosis is less likely as arterial Doppler signals were present. Compartment syndrome could present similar symptoms but is generally a result of trauma or overuse, and in this case, there was no evidence of intravenous infiltration causing such issue. Lastly, secondary lymphedema usually develops gradually and is less likely to cause sudden localized swelling and pain as described in the patient's case. A pseudoaneurysm occurs when a blood vessel wall is injured, and a palpable pulsating mass is often present. Hence this diagnosis is more consistent with the clinical context and symptoms presented.

D: Rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm. 

Explanation: Based on the man's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, a rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm seems most likely. The CECT image shows an intra-abdominal hyperdense mass that may be representative of a pseudoaneurysm, a complication commonly seen with inflammations like pancreatitis or trauma. Additionally, visceral artery angiogram revealing an aneurysm supports this diagnosis. His elevated white blood cell count might indicate an ongoing inflammation, while pain, nausea, and vomiting are typical symptoms. Although other mentioned conditions might present with similar symptoms, the results of imaging brought more clarity supporting the diagnosis of the rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm.

827
D: Proceed with sclerotomies, ie, creation of scleral windows.

Explanation: The patient's clinical features and the imaging characteristics indicate the presence of a ciliochoroidal effusion, possibly associated with an aqueous misdirection syndrome. The absence of intrinsic vascular pulsations on imaging makes the possibility of a vascular tumor less likely. Therefore, therapeutic measures should be focused on drainage of the effusion, which can alleviate the eye's IOP. Thus, option D: sclerotomies, the surgical creation of windows in the sclera to allow for fluid drainage, is the most appropriate next step. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy might not be necessary in this case because there is no suggestion of a neoplastic lesion. The plaque radiotherapy is applied for ocular tumors, specifically, whereas in this case there's no definitive mass for which radiation could be targeted. The use of oral corticosteroids could potentially exacerbate increased IOP in a glaucoma patient, despite their theoretical utility in inflammation reduction.

C: Obtain blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.

Explanation: This case presents a variety of symptoms, including impaired vision, bilateral mydriasis with a reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation, and progressive generalized autonomic dysfunction. Together, these symptoms point towards a systemic issue rather than a local one, which makes autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) a suitable diagnostic possibility. AAG is a rare neurological disorder that commonly presents with symptoms of autonomic dysfunction like the ones described in the case. To confirm this, a blood sample can be drawn to test for the presence of autoantibodies that block the function of the autonomic neurons. Therefore, doing this would be the most appropriate next step. Options A, B and D would not directly address the symptoms holistically or provide valuable information in terms of diagnosis.

B: Obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy. 

Explanation: The presentation of a peaked pupil indicates that there may be an underlying irregularity causing the pupil's abnormal shape. The pigmented trabecular meshwork, as ascertained from the gonioscopy, provides further support to this hypothesis. An ultrasonographic biomicroscopy, option B, would help in further evaluating the anterior segment and offer clarity about the cause of the peaked pupil. This investigation would provide information on any possible abnormal tissue configuration or potential recurrence of the tumor. It may also help to rule out any further involvement of the tumor, which could potentially be present but not visible on the slitlamp examination. Continuing or delaying the mitomycin C without a further understanding of the cause of the peaked pupil could potentially miss an opportunity to detect a condition needing immediate attention. Hence, option B is a measured and advisable course of action in this scenario.

C: Reassure the patient that VF loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves and recommend annual evaluation to monitor VF.

Explanation: The patient's ocular history, visual acuities, intraocular pressure, and clinical examination findings, especially the presence of bilateral tilted optic nerves with peripapillary atrophy, suggest congenital anomalies rather than acquired ischemic optic neuropathy or glaucoma. Thus, it is most appropriate to reassure the patient about the congenital nature of his VF loss and recommend regular examinations to monitor the stability of his VF. The use of daily aspirin is usually not indicated for this patient because he has no apparent risk factors for vascular occlusive disease. There is also no indication of moderate glaucoma or a necessary target intraocular pressure that necessitates laser treatment.

A. 

Explanation: 

The patient's symptomatology, which includes the onset of chest pain radiating down his left arm along with vomiting, is indicative of myocardial infarction, which is a prevalent complication post heart transplantation. Moreover, the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram both present typical features of myocardial infarction, including anteroseptal akinesis and reduced left ventricular function, further supporting this diagnosis. 

Therefore, the first recommended investigation is coronary angiogram in tandem with endomyocardial biopsy. 

An angiogram would support in identifying the occlusion causing the MI, whereas the biopsy would aid in distinguishing between organ rejection and other possible causes of graft dysfunction. While the other answers are accurate testing options in the post-transplant setting, the unbiased clinical and imaging evidence clearly points towards a coronary event, making option A the most optimal initial step in this scenario.
A: Carcinoma erysipeloides (cutaneous metastases of breast cancer)

Explanation: The woman's extensive history of breast cancer along with the described erysipeloid plaques are consistent with Carcinoma erysipeloides, a rare form of cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer. This diagnosis is further supported by the absence of typical signs and symptoms of other conditions like erysipelas (fever, acute pain, systemic inflammation). Similarly, the symptoms observed do not align with radiation dermatitis or radiation-induced morphea, which usually cause skin changes rapidly after radiation exposure and would not explain the warm and indurated erysipeloid plaques. Finally, recent mammogram and (PET/CT) showed no active disease, suggesting the skin changes are not a result of an active localized breast cancer or an infection that might cause Erysipelas.

C: Perform a skeletal survey and refer for ophthalmologic consultation 

Explanation: The clinical presentation of the patient suggests a case of Neurofibromatosis type 1(NF1) or other types of neurocutaneous syndromes. These conditions often present as café-au-lait spots or hyperpigmented macules in early childhood. Multiple hyperpigmented macules most likely reflect melanin accumulation because of increased melanocyte activity, raising suspicion for a neurocutaneous disorder. A detailed assessment including a skeletal survey and ophthalmologic consultation are crucial in these conditions to look for associated anomalies, such as optic gliomas or Lisch nodules or bone deformities. Other options such as applying antifungals etc. may not be beneficial as the described lesions do not suggest a fungal etiology. Similarly, stroking the skin lesion (to check if lesion turns white) is not applicable here. The history does not suggest any drug exposure leading to hyperpigmentation.

B: Proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: Given the patient's presentation with elevated serum creatinine, a history of hypertension, low hemoglobin concentration, normal kidney structures, and the presence of tea-colored urine during a previous upper respiratory infection, these signs are suggestive of a renal disorder, likely glomerulonephritis. Proliferative glomerulonephritis involves inflammation and proliferation of the glomerular cells of the kidney, which can result in the abnormal kidney function observed in this patient. Urinary tract infection or hypertensive nephrosclerosis would typically present with other symptoms like urinary discomfort, or more severe hypertension respectively. Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis, on the other hand, typically presents with a more rapid deterioration of kidney function. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is proliferative glomerulonephritis.

B: Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple, erythematous, crusted, and pustular plaques limited to the trunk and sparing other regions suggests the diagnosis of generalized Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD). HHD, also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus, is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent erythematous plaques, often accompanied by fissuring, crusting, and pustulation. Although primarily affecting the axillae and groin, in rare instances, it can turn into a generalized form, as in this case. Histopathological examination typically reveals suprabasilar acantholysis, further supporting this diagnosis. Despite the patient's long-standing history of seemingly similar lesions, previously diagnosed and treated as separate instances, the current widespread presentation makes the diagnosis of generalized HHD more likely.

836
D: Oral melanoacanthoma

Explanation: The diffuse proliferation of melanocytes, as observed in this case, is typical of oral melanoacanthoma. Moreover, melanocytes exhibiting dendritic processes throughout the entire thickness of the epithelium and melanin incontinence are characteristic features. While other options could present as oral pigmentation, the histopathologic findings mentioned above are more suggestive of oral melanoacanthoma. For instance, an oral melanotic macule usually exhibits a basilar proliferation of melanocytes, without the pronounced dendritic spread seen here, while oral malignant melanoma would typically show additional signs of malignancy such as cytologic atypia and mitotic figures, which are absent in this case. Lastly, oral melanocytic nevus would normally present as a well-circumscribed proliferation of nevus cells, unlike the diffuse pattern seen in melanoacanthoma. Hence, the correct answer based on these findings is D: Oral melanoacanthoma.

B: Disseminated varicella zoster virus

Explanation: The patient's presentations of fever, neutropenia, and vesicular rash with erythematous base were most consistent with a viral infection. Additionally, the patient's histopathological findings from the punch biopsy (i.e., multinucleated giant cells) indicate a herpes virus infection. Given the patient's age and examination results, disseminated varicella zoster virus (VZV) seems to be the most probable diagnosis. VZV causes varicella (chickenpox), and reactivation of latent infection can cause zoster (shingles). Disseminated VZV often manifests as a vesicular rash that progresses to involve multiple organs in immunocompromised patients. Tissue and blood cultures, as well as negative herpes simplex virus tests, also help to rule out other potential diagnoses such as Listeriosis or Bacillus cereus infection.

838
C: Neurocutaneous melanosis

Explanation: The clinical scenario suggests the presence of Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM), a rare, congenital, non-hereditary disorder characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic lesions of the central nervous system. The genetic mutation in the N-ras-2 gene, multiple congenital nevi, plus the presence of multiple intracranial parenchymal lesions that have been persisting and progressing over a decade are consistent with diagnosis of NCM. Brain MRI findings of multiple lesions involving different areas like pons, bilateral amygdala, temporal pole, parasylvian region, along with developing mass in third ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus also fits the typical imaging findings of NCM. While primary intracranial melanoma is a possibility, the decade-long clinical course makes this less likely. Similarly, metastatic melanoma is less likely in this case due to lack of history of tumors elsewhere. Lymphoma usually does not present with multiple congenital skin nevi.

B: Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis)

Explanation: Nicolau syndrome, also known as livedoid dermatitis, is a rare complication that can occur following intramuscular injection. This syndrome is characterized by pain at the site of injection followed by erythema, purpura, and potential necrosis. The symptoms described in the case, including severe pain at the site of injection, swelling and purpura overlying the site of injection, worsening pain, and numbness and tingling of the skin involved, as well as the eventual formation of retiform purpura with central necrosis, closely align with this syndrome. The necrosis that follows can be severe, potentially requiring surgical debridement or leading to complications such as contractures or amputation. In this case, the symptoms began almost immediately post-injection, which is also typical of Nicolau syndrome. Pyomyositis, retained foreign body and necrotizing fasciitis would present differently and typically have other associated systemic or local symptoms. The normal blood test results, including complete blood cell count and coagulation profile, further suggest that an infection-driven process like pyomyositis or necrotizing fasciitis is less likely.

A: Perforated appendicitis

Explanation: Although the presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, and signs of localized tenderness or peritoneal irritation might be suggestive of several conditions, her presentation is most common in appendicitis, an inflammation of the appendix. It is often characterized by an initial phase of diffuse, visceral pain followed by nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, and subsequently localization of pain to the right lower quadrant. The elevated white blood cell count also supports this diagnosis. Despite absence of visible appendix in ultrasonography, negative imaging findings are not uncommon in pediatric patients with appendicitis as the appendix may be retrocecal, as the CT images suggest. This case is more suggestive of Perforated Appendicitis because the CT images show an inflamed retrocecal mass, indicating a later stage of the disease where the inflamed appendix has ruptured or perforated. Plus, the patient's symptoms did not improve significantly with IV hydration, suggesting a more severe pathology.

841
D: Descending necrotizing mediastinitis. 

Explanation: The patient’s clinical presentation of severe chest pain after forceful coughing, along with swelling of the neck, is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM), a severe infection of the neck and mediastinal area. The CT scan findings of extensive soft tissue inflammation and mediastinal edema further support this diagnosis. In DNM, infection usually originates from the oropharyngeal area and descends along deep fascial planes of the neck into the mediastinum, typically after a triggering event such as forceful coughing. Option A, acute jugular thrombosis, is less likely as there is no evidence given of deep vein thrombosis symptoms. Option B, spontaneous chylothorax, would usually present with respiratory symptoms and is less likely due to the absence of trauma or surgery. Option C, contained esophageal perforation would typically present with markedly worse systemic symptoms and likely acute abdomen. The lack of contrast extravasation on barium swallow also reduces this likelihood.

842
C. 

Explanation: 

The patient demonstrates typical clinical features of infectious meningitis, including fever, photophobia, headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness. However, the finding of aseptic meningitis on CSF studies is suggestive of a non-bacterial cause of meningitis. This, combined with her unilateral blurry vision and significant inflammatory findings on fundus examination, raises suspicion for a systemic infectious disease that can cause both aseptic meningitis and intraocular inflammation. Such systemic infections include Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), all of which can present with similar symptoms and ocular manifestations. It would therefore be wise to investigate for these systemic infectious diseases before initiating steroid or antiviral treatment that could potentially worsen the underlying infectious process if present.
C: Order computed tomography of the head/facial bones

Explanation: Given the patient's deep midfacial laceration and the clear fluid draining from the wound site, there is a possibility of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. This may indicate a fracture in the anterior cranial fossa or a direct laceration of the dura. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and facial bones would help identify the presence of fractures as well as provide a rough estimate of the damage to the brain and surrounding structures, which is necessary for further planning of surgical intervention. Other options could be considered after ruling out or confirming the presence of a CSF leak and/or fractures.

844
B: Obtain more information on the patient’s history

Explanation: Given the uncommon presentation of retinal whitening with tiny intraretinal hemorrhages focused in the posterior pole after an uncomplicated cataract surgery, the clinician should strive to obtain a more detailed patient history. This approach aims to rule out any potentially unknown risk factors, exposures, or comorbidities that could suggest a specific diagnosis or pathology. This way the clinician can steer clear of unnecessary treatments or interventions which may cause unwanted side-effects or complications. Other options such as systemic steroids and vitreous tap and injection of foscarnet are quite invasive and are generally kept as the last resort in case of unexplained post-operative symptoms. Infectious and autoimmune workup might be too broad for this particular case presentation. Therefore, before any empirical intervention, a thorough patient history might provide the clearest direction for the next steps.

B: Shorten the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds.

Explanation: Based on the given information, this patient's symptoms of generalized weakness and fatigue, combined with recent falls, likely result from pacemaker syndrome. Pacemaker syndrome classically manifests as fatigue, dizziness, dyspnea, and/or hypotension; some patients may experience syncope or near-syncope. Although it is most often triggered by ventricular pacing, dual-chamber pacing (as in this case) can also cause the syndrome, particularly when there is a large AV delay. The AV delay allows for ventricular contraction before the atria have had time to fill with blood, which reduces the ventricular preload and cardiac output. The symptoms often improve when the patient lies down (increasing the preload), and they can even occur in patients with preserved left ventricular function (as in this patient). Therefore, the best next step would be to shorten the AV delay (option B) to allow the atrial kick to contribute to ventricular filling before depolarization. This should alleviate the patient's symptoms and minimize the risk of future falls. In comparison, other options such as increasing the pacing rate or the refractory period are unlikely to provide benefit and may even exacerbate the symptoms. Referring the patient for a lead revision would not be appropriate at this stage, as adjustment of the pacemaker settings is likely to resolve the problem.

846
C: Plasmacytoma

Explanation: The case presentation of painful cutaneous nodules in a patient with a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma is suggestive of cutaneous plasmacytomas. Plasmacytomas are solitary masses of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells in either bone or soft tissue, which have been reported as an extramedullary manifestation of multiple myeloma. The history of κ-restricted plasma cell population positive for CD38 and CD138 and negative for CD3, CD20, and CD45 expression also supports this diagnosis. The physical examination results, showing nonulcerated, round, firm, tender nodules are also consistent with descriptions of cutaneous plasmacytomas in the medical literature. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis would confirm the diagnosis. The other options (Hemangioma, Neutrophilic dermatoses, Leukemia cutis) are less likely given the patient's history and presenting symptoms.
C

847
B: The patient has probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of granulomatous polyangiitis, use of immunosuppressive therapy, and presence of bilateral nodular infiltrates and a cavitary nodule suggest that he is at increased risk for invasive fungal infection. The elevated Aspergillus galactomannan antigen titer further supports the diagnosis of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, as per the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) Consensus Group's definitions. Other conditions (eg, colonization, contamination, other types of molds, certain antibiotics) can cause a positive galactomannan result, but they are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and risk factors. Therefore, while the patient does not meet the criteria for proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to lack of histopathologic confirmation, his clinical features and test results suggest probable invasive disease. He should therefore be treated accordingly.

A: Obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain 

Explanation: In this case, given the long term growth and anytime bleeding, it's important to rule out any malignant growth. Hematoxylin-eosin stain is a common staining technique used in histological diagnosis so it will provide a pathological assessment of the tissue. A biopsy would reveal the nature of the cells in the nodule (benign or malignant), facilitating the appropriate treatment approach. Neither the clinical appearance nor the details provided suggest a fungal etiology, eliminating the need for a fungal culture. Without definitive diagnosis, treatments like cryotherapy and pulsed dye laser therapy may not be appropriate at this stage.

849
Answer: A

Explanation: The initial urine drug screen is positive for cocaine but negative for opioids. As hydrocodone metabolizes to hydromorphone, and may further metabolize to morphine in small amounts, the absence of these metabolites in the urine indicates that the patient is not using hydrocodone. The presence of cocaine metabolite (benzoylecgonine) in the patient's urine indicates recent cocaine use. Therefore, it suggests that the patient is not using hydrocodone, but is using cocaine.
B: Results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Explanation: The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome needs confirmation of antiphospholipid antibodies on two separate occasions at least 12 weeks apart, according to the Sydney criteria. This is critical because transiently positive antiphospholipid antibodies can occur in various settings, including infections and medications. Persistently positive results are more likely to be clinically significant and associated with the thrombosis risk related to antiphospholipid syndrome. The initial test results of this patient were suggestive but not diagnostic of antiphospholipid syndrome; thus a repeat test after 12 weeks is necessary for confirming the diagnosis.

851
C: Carcinoid syndrome

Explanation: The combination of symptoms such as leonine facies (lion-like appearance), flushing, diarrhea, and ocular changes seen in this case, along with the finding of multiple hepatic masses on CT scan, are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with carcinoid tumors, which are neuroendocrine tumors that produce excess serotonin. It is characterized by symptoms like flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and less often, changes in the skin including pellagra-like skin changes, thickening of the skin, or leonine facies. The initial presence of a pulmonary tumor might have been the primary tumor, and the hepatic masses suggest metastatic disease. The skin biopsy showing scarce lymphocytic infiltrate and sebaceous hyperplasia also supports the diagnosis. Chromogranin A, a commonly used marker for neuroendocrine tumors, was found to be diffusely expressed in the cells of the man's earlier lung tumor, adding further support to the diagnosis.

B: IgA pemphigus

Explanation: The patient's skin lesions and laboratory findings are most in line with IgA pemphigus. Characteristic clinical features include annular pustules that can be flaccid due to intraepidernal blistering that results from acantholysis of keratinocytes which was observed in the histopathological evaluation (Figure C). Further, immunofluorescence showed intercellular IgA depositions in the subcorneal layer (Figure D), ensuring the diagnosis of IgA pemphigus, which responds poorly to topical steroid treatment, aligning with the case presentation. Other conditions like Tinea corporis, Duhring disease and Psoriasis pustulosa don't typically have the same histopathological presentation and clinical pattern as in this case.

853
A: Mucormycosis. 

Explanation: The lesion's presentation, especially when compounded with the patient's immunocompromised state due to acute lymphocytic leukemia and chemotherapy, is suggestive of a serious fungal infection. The histopathological findings of broad, mostly nonseptate hyphae surrounding and infiltrating dermal blood vessels, as well as the fungal culture results revealing free spores and round terminal sporangia, are characteristic of Mucormycosis. Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis, is a rare, invasive, and often lethal fungal infection that disproportionately affects immunocompromised individuals, such as people undergoing chemotherapy or those with diabetes mellitus. These fungi, members of the order Mucorales, commonly colonize the skin at the site of trauma or wounds. Identification is through fungal culture and tissue biopsy, which typically reveals broad non-septate hyphae. Prompt treatment with aggressive surgical debridement and high-dose antifungal therapy is required for this infection.

D: Herpes simplex virus. 

Explanation: The baby's premature birth, early onset encephalopathy, vesicular rash, and high AST level, together with the mother's history of prolonged rupture of membranes, are all suggestive of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Neonatal herpes can be transmitted during delivery through an infected birth canal, but it can also occur in utero, especially in the context of premature birth. High aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in neonates can suggest a wide range of conditions; however, when it is seen together with a vesicular rash, it is strongly suggestive for a disseminated herpes simplex virus infection. Congenital varicella usually presents with limb hypoplasia and cutaneous scars. Transient neonatal pustular melanosis usually affects term infants and presents with vesicopustules that evolve into hyperpigmented macules, while candidiasis typically presents as a confluent erythematous rash with peripheral pustules.

855
C: Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. 

Explanation: The term idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) describes a rare inflammatory condition of the breast characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are collections of immune cells. In this case, the biopsy results showing granulomatous inflammation with histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, in conjunction with the lack of clinical signs of infection or malignancy, points to IGM. Additionally, this condition is often associated with women of childbearing age who have breastfed, which aligns with the patient's history. Although mastitis is commonly associated with breastfeeding, the woman had stopped breastfeeding 10 months prior, which makes recent mastitis less probable. While tuberculosis could in rare cases present with similar histologic findings, the negative QuantiFERON test, which screens for TB infection, makes tuberculous mastitis less likely. Lastly, the patient's results and history do not suggest an infection, cancer, or any immunosuppression-related disorder that might cause breast changes, ruling out options A, B, and D.

856
C: Pheochromocytoma

Explanation:
The diagnosis is likely Pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal glands which secrete excess amounts of adrenaline, causing episodes of high blood pressure, sweating, rapid heart rate, and severe headache. The mass lies in the right infrarenal retroperitoneum, fitting with the location of adrenal glands. The patient's normetanephrine levels are elevated, which is a characteristic finding in pheochromocytoma. The pronounced arterial supply and hypertrophied perivascular plexus are also in line with characteristics of this type of tumor. The mass was successfully embolized and surgically removed, which is typical treatment for this condition. In addition, patient's six year history of decreased appetite could also be related to Pheochromocytoma as symptoms could vary and sometimes be nonspecific.

C: Observe and repeat spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year

Explanation: 
In this case, the best approach would be to observe and repeat the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year. The patient's history of Alport Syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities, might explain his bilateral retinal changes. Although Alport Syndrome is known for affecting the anterior aspects of the eye, such as the lens, cases showing retinal changes have been documented. Given that the patient has already completed treatment for keratouveitis and there are no new abnormalities, immediate intervention (like vitrectomy, viral injections, or intravitreal injections of ocriplasmin) isn't necessary at this time. Instead, closely monitoring these retinal changes through repeat optical coherence tomography scans may be beneficial in identifying any progressive changes over time which may require further intervention. His retinal changes may also be a manifestation of his genetic syndrome rather than an indicative of an ongoing infection or a membrane pathology. Hence, any invasive procedure could possibly cause more harm than benefit in his situation. Hence, the best action would be option C.

D: Start systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery. 

Explanation: The patient's age, the quality and location of her pain, its association with mastication, her weight loss, her elevated C-reactive protein level, and particularly the relieved symptoms by mouth guard which could decrease the tension of temporal artery while clenching teeth, all suggest giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA). GCA is a vasculitis that affects medium and large arteries, most commonly the superficial temporal artery. It can result in ocular morbidity, including vision loss, if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The optic disc looks normal because the condition arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (a presentation of GCA) can present initially with a normal disc before disc edema develops. The standard treatment for suspected GCA is immediate initiation of systemic corticosteroids, which can prevent further vision loss, followed by temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

A: Observe and repeat imaging in 6 months

Explanation: The findings include a symptom-free patient with an independent circumscribed iris elevation inferotemporally in her right eye, and a few similar-appearing asymptomatic lesions in other quadrants, accompanied by normal intraocular pressure and no iridociliary lesions seen after pupillary dilation. Considering that the patient doesn't have any major symptoms apart from occasional mild discomfort easily controlled with artificial tears and there is no evidence of any immediate threat to her vision, it is best to adopt a cautious 'wait and monitor' approach. The first line of action should be to simply observe the patient and repeat imaging studies in about 6 months. Other invasive options like attempting a lesion rupture with a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser or performing a lesion biopsy should be left as a later resort unless there is evidence of progression, complication, or a threat to the patient's vision. In this case, there is no indication or necessity for conducting a systemic workup for occult malignancy. The most cautious and minimally invasive approach would be to simply observe the patient and repeat the imaging in 6 months to monitor for any changes in the lesions.

C: Perform fine-needle aspiration. 

Explanation: The best course of action in the scenario mentioned would be to perform fine needle aspiration (C). This is done to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the content of the observed mass in the right orbit. Considering the patient's history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (a genetic disorder that can cause blood vessel malformations), it's possible that the mass could be a hematoma or a vascular malformation. A fine-needle aspiration can help differentiate between these possibilities. The other options mentioned such as observing (A), performing canthotomy and cantholysis (B), or performing surgical drainage of the collection (D), may be inappropriate at this stage as the exact nature of the mass remains unknown. Therefore, obtaining a biopsy first is crucial.

B: Observe and continue treatment for GVHD

Explanation: The patient is diagnosed with bradycardia but is asymptomatic, which means intervention (i.e., placing a pacemaker whether dual chamber, transvenous or transcutaneous) may not be necessarily required at this stage. Instead, it is recommended to monitor the patient and manage her existing condition of GVHD. Changes in heart rhythm can be seen in individuals with GVHD, possibly due to altered immune response or direct tissue damage, but the heart often continues to function effectively. Effective management of GVHD may help in resolving the bradycardia. However, it is essential to continue observing the patient's cardiac status and intervene if the patient develops symptoms related to bradycardia.

A: Rhabdomyoma

Explanation: The clinical features outlined: a well-circumscribed, non-invasive laryngeal mass, along with the histopathological features: polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross striations, point towards a rhabdomyoma. Rhabdomyoma, a benign tumor of striated muscle, is a rare tumor in the larynx but exhibits characteristic histologic features of cross-striations in cells, which were observed in this case. The other options like granular cell tumor, paraganglioma, and hibernoma do not align with histopathological findings.
A
863
B: Bartonella henselae infection

Explanation: Bartonella henselae is responsible for cat scratch disease (CSD) and Bacillary Angiomatosis. The history of scratch by a cat associated with the erythematous to violaceous, tender, edematous, targetoid nodules and plaques are consistent with a Bartonella henselae infection. This bacteria is a gram-negative rod that is typically transmitted via the scratch or bite of an infected cat. It specifically has a predilection for infecting individuals who are immunocompromised such as this patient with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and neutropenia. Some reports also demonstrate a higher risk of disseminated disease in individuals with neutropenia and p53 mutations, which this patient has.  This bacterial infection can result in various manifestations but commonly presents as tender regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and a papule or pustule at the inoculation site. The patient's presentation of fever and skin findings coupled with his history of contact with a cat is highly suggestive of this diagnosis.

C

Explanation: The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) is a tool used to screen for the presence and severity of depression. A score of 16 indicates moderately severe depression. This patient's symptoms, including increased hopelessness, insomnia, and decreased energy, also align with a diagnosis of depression. Therefore, while it's established that the patient has major depressive disorder from his history, the current test results show that the patient has depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity in his present situation. Choice C is the most accurate interpretation of these specific test results. While he does carry a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the test doesn't confirm this diagnosis (A); it only measures current symptom severity. B is incorrect as dysthymic disorder is characterized by chronic, long-term sadness and loss of interest, but is less severe than major depressive disorder. D is potentially true but the provided test results and information do not offer any insight regarding a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
B: Evaluate for systemic vasculitis.

Explanation: The patient’s history and physical examination findings are suggestive of small-vessel vasculitis, as confirmed by the skin biopsy results, which showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), a histopathologic description of small-vessel vasculitis. LCV presents clinically as palpable purpura, predominantly in dependent areas, although other cutaneous manifestations can occur. The presence of systemic symptoms or other organ involvement suggests that a systemic vasculitis, such as cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, microscopic polyangiitis, or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) may be present. Systemic vasculitis is usually managed with systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive agents; however, these are not indicated, and potentially harmful, in cases of cutaneous-limited disease. Therefore, it is vital to conduct an evaluation for potential systemic vasculitis before initiating such therapy. If an underlying systemic condition is present, treating it usually improves cutaneous vasculitis. Conversely, if a systemic disease is not identified, treating cutaneous-limited vasculitis skillfully can often spare patients the risks associated with systemic treatments. Thus, Option B is the preferred next step in management.

D: X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder

Explanation: 

The clinical features of reticulate hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, photophobia, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections point towards X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder. Features that further support this diagnosis include the manifestation of the symptoms since early childhood, the patient's male gender, and the inheritance pattern of similarly affected men on the mother's side of the family, which are all consistent with an X-linked inheritance pattern. Moreover, the lack of nail dystrophy, palmoplantar keratoderma, or oral leukoplakia rules out other differential diagnoses such as Dyskeratosis congenita. The normal appearance of nails and absence of reticulate pigmentation of intertriginous areas helps rule out Dowling-Degos disease. Lastly, the absence of alopecia and keratoderma makes Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis unlikely.

D: Erythema dyschromicum perstans. 

Explanation: Erythema dyschromicum perstans, also known as ashy dermatosis, is a chronic disorder of pigmentation affecting individuals of all ages, though it is more common in the first three decades of life. The fundamental symptom involves well-demarcated, round, gray-blue or gray-brown patches of skin, frequently symmetrically distributed. Generally, these patches are asymptomic, which aligns with the patient's symptom history. They commonly present on the trunk and proximal extremities, but can also manifest on the face and neck. The lower extremity distribution in this patient is atypical but not outside the range of possibility. The histopathology, which shows a bandlike lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction with melanophages in the papillary dermis, confirms the diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms and the biopsy report do not fit with the other options, hence they can be ruled out.

C: Xanthoma disseminatum

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple sites of involvement with yellow-brown and red-brown papules along with the exhibit of symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia and nocturia match with the profile of Xanthoma disseminatum, a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Other diseases such as Xanthogranuloma and Erdheim-Chester disease typically includes other manifestations and specific age groups that are not consistent with the case presented. Generalized eruptive histiocytoma could present with similar skin lesions, but they are usually transient and it is less likely to encompass the reported systemic symptoms. Therefore, the presented symptoms and findings in this case align most appropriately with the diagnosis of Xanthoma disseminatum. However, a conclusive diagnosis would generally require histopathological confirmation.

B: Dyshidrotic eczema 

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient, including pruritic, tapioca-like vesicles on the palms and soles, as well as the recalcitrance to oral antibiotics and topical steroids, is highly suggestive of dyshidrotic eczema (also known as pompholyx). This condition is characterized by sudden onset of small, deep-seated vesicles on the palms, sides of fingers, and soles of the feet, with accompanying pruritus. Factors that can trigger dyshidrotic eczema include stress, allergens, and irritants, such as nickel and cobalt. Although the other conditions can present with similar symptoms, they're less likely in this case. Childhood bullous pemphigoid, for instance, would typically display generalized or localized blisters while bullous tinea would present with blistering but is associated with fungal infection. Distal blistering dactylitis, on the other hand, is generally seen with bacterial infections, such as caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

C: Mucocele of the appendix

Explanation: The presence of a large cystic mass in the right iliac fossa, with no symptoms indicative of rectal bleeding, change in bowel habits or weight loss, makes the diagnosis of a mucocele of the appendix more probable. An appendix mucocele is a rare benign tumor of the appendix, often detected incidentally. 

In addition, the noted external compression of the cecum further supports the diagnosis of mucocele. In case of cecal carcinoma or appendix abscess, more systemic symptoms are usually present. A neuroendocrine tumor is not likely either as these tumors are typically solid. The CT image provided supports a diagnosis of a mucocele due to the cystic nature of the mass imaged. Therefore, given the presenting symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely choice would be an appendix mucocele.

A: Tumor recurrence

Explanation: The presence of a tubular solid structure within the body of the stomach, as shown in the patient's computed tomographic scan, along with his elevated lipase levels and ongoing sharp abdominal pain raises suspicion for a recurrence of carcinoma. It is not uncommon for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to recur after a Whipple procedure, especially within the first few years following surgery. Rebound, guarding, or any palpable masses were absent, which might suggest other possible diagnoses such as an internal hernia or afferent loop syndrome. The absence of other digestive symptoms does not support the likelihood of a marginal ulcer. However, it's important to note that further investigations would be needed to confirm this diagnosis, such as biopsy of the mass.

C: Perform a biopsy of the lesion.

Explanation: Given the rapid development of the lesion, its vascular appearance, and the patient’s history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and chronic graft-vs-host disease, a concerning possibility is ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). This condition can be challenging to distinguish clinically from benign conjunctival changes seen in ocular graft-vs-host disease, and definitive diagnosis typically requires histopathologic analysis. While optical coherence tomography and cultures may provide additional information, they would not definitively rule out neoplasia. Biopsy of the lesion is recommended to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy.

C: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy, followed by observation if the results are consistent with a benign mixed tumor

Explanation: Given the findings, enlargement of orbital mass without pain, redness, photophobia, or recent trauma, a well-circumscribed, round, solid, and minimally enhancing soft tissue mass in the superotemporal left orbit with an adjacent bone excavation and no calcifications, the most appropriate next step in management would be fine-needle aspiration biopsy. This would allow for a minimally invasive diagnosis, and if the results are consistent with a benign tumor, observation would be the appropriate follow-up strategy, as benign orbital tumors are typically slow growing and often do not require further intervention unless they cause symptoms or progress. The start of administering steroids and/or antibiotics (option B) might be indicated if there was evidence of infection or inflammation, which is not present in this case. Excisional biopsy (option D) would be a more invasive approach and may not be necessary if the tumor is found to be benign. Option A, observation, may delay necessary treatment if the mass is in fact malignant.

C: Discuss the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy

Explanation: The clinical findings and imaging results reveal the presence of bilateral subretinal granulomas. This condition is unlikely to resolve spontaneously and it is known to be resistant to anti-VEGF therapy, making options A, B, and D less appropriate. Oral corticosteroids are typically the first-line therapy for noninfectious posterior uveitis including subretinal granulomatous inflammation. While these medications can reduce intraocular inflammation and improve vision, they also carry significant potential side effects which may include osteoporosis, glaucoma, cataracts, hypertension, hyperglycemia, weight gain, mood changes, and exacerbation of co-existing conditions such as peptic ulcer disease and infections. It's crucial to discuss the risks and potential benefits with the patient before initiating this therapy. It's also important to monitor the patient regularly during treatment to manage any adverse effects and assess the therapeutic response.

A

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms are consistent with neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis. He has multiple high-risk sexual partners, suggesting a higher risk of syphilis infection. The lesions observed in the eye and the symptoms of tinnitus and altered vision are associated with the neurological and ocular manifestations of syphilis. Therefore, it would be prudent to confirm this suspicion through a rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test which would indicate if the patient has a syphilis infection. If confirmed, this would guide the subsequent treatment approach which would involve antibiotic therapy.
B: Give amiodarone for treatment of ventricular tachycardia.

Explanation: The electrocardiogram findings for this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia that originates from the ventricles and can lead to hemodynamic instability. This woman's history of hypertension and her symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnea, elevated heart rate, and moderately high blood pressure, all suggest she may be experiencing VT. Options A, C, and D are less likely in this case. Direct current cardioversion and coronary angiography (Option A) can be first-line treatment in patients with hemodynamically unstable VT, but are generally reserved for patients who cannot be managed with drug therapy. Administration of procainamide (Option C) is usually reserved for treatment of preexcited atrial fibrillation, which this patient does not appear to be experiencing based on her clinical presentation and EKG findings. Adenosine (Option D) is typically administered for acute management of supraventricular tachycardia, which also does not align with the patient's presentation. Therefore, option B, the administration of amiodarone for VT, is the most appropriate action in this case. Amiodarone is a broad spectrum antiarrhythmic that slows conduction and prolongs the refractory period in the myocardium, reducing the likelihood of re-entrant rhythms that can lead to VT.

877
D: The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Explanation: 
Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a metabolic condition characterized by elevated urinary calcium excretion in the absence of secondary causes. In this case, the patient's dietary intake, serum levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone are all normal, ruling out high intake of animal proteins or salt and any renal tubular disorders as potential causes of his hypercalciuria. Hence, the patient's hypercalciuria seems to be idiopathic in nature. This condition is a common cause of calcium kidney stones and is often familial, fitting in with his family history. Managing idiopathic hypercalciuria often involves a combination of dietary modifications and medical management, such as consuming a diet low in sodium and maintaining adequate hydration, which the patient is already doing. It's also important to maintain an adequate intake of dietary calcium to prevent bone loss.

878
B: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor

Explanation: An inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is typically characterized by the presence of myofibroblastic spindle cells mixed with an inflammatory infiltrate of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. The positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) for activin-like kinase-1 (Alk-1) also supports this diagnosis. This benign lesion can mimic malignant neoplasms both clinically and histologically, which is why careful pathologic examination is required. Nodular fasciitis is a self-limiting pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation but it generally does not present with a lymphocytic inflammatory component. A spindle cell carcinoma would show cytokeratin positivity. Rhabdomyosarcoma typically affects young adults and children and is generally positive for desmin, which was negative in this case. The described benign clinical course, the absence of cytologic atypia, the mixed inflammatory infiltrate, and the positive Alk-1 staining are the main points suggesting an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.
B
879
C: Plasmablastic lymphoma

Explanation: The patient's presentation, immunohistochemistry findings, pathology, presence of EBV-EBER, and strong expression of CD138 all point towards a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma, a rare and aggressive variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Plasmablastic lymphoma often presents in the context of immunosuppression (HIV/AIDS) and is frequently associated with EBV infection.
C
880
C: Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma

Explanation: The clinical and pathological features align with the diagnosis of Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma. These tumors, which are rare benign neoplasms, generally present in middle-aged and older adults and often exhibit a long duration of growth before diagnosis. Typical locations are in the lower neck, supraclavicular region, and upper mediastinum, exactly the region observed in this case. The elements of squamous epithelium, spindle cells, and mature adipose tissue in the pathology further reinforce this diagnosis, as these are common components in these types of tumors.
C
881
C: Sinonasal mucosal melanoma

Explanation: Sinonasal mucosal melanoma often presents as a unilateral nasal obstruction, similar to what the patient is experiencing. It may also be associated with recurrent epistaxis, as seen in this patient. Upon examination, the mass presented as dark soft-tissue which can be associated with pigmentation particular to melanomas. The histopathological findings that reveal atypical, pleomorphic epithelioid cells, some with prominent pigment, align with features of a melanoma. Moreover, the positive immunohistochemical stains for HMB-45 and S-100 further support the diagnosis as these are typically positive in melanomas. Other options like leiomyosarcoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma may exhibit similar symptoms but lack the characteristic pigmentation and staining patterns seen in this case.
C
882
C: Perform a bone marrow biopsy. 

Explanation: Given the presence of blasts in the peripheral blood, the most likely diagnosis in this case is acute leukemia, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML), due to the age of the patient and the absence of eosinophils and basophils, which are common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Moreover, the presence of spontaneous ecchymoses, epistaxis, and severe thrombocytopenia are also suggestive of a bone marrow failure syndromes like AML. Although treatments like cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can be considered, it is crucial to first confirm the diagnosis, identify any cytogenetic abnormalities, and establish the subtype of the leukemia. This is best done through a bone marrow biopsy. Thus, the next best step in this case would be to perform a bone marrow biopsy before initiating any treatment regimen.

B: Pheochromocytoma; proceed with imaging studies.

Explanation: This patient's chronic paroxysmal palpitations, flushing, pale complexion, and diaphoresis, along with elevated plasma metanephrines, point towards a pheochromocytoma - a neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes catecholamines. These tumors are episodically active, leading to paroxysmal symptoms and signs, which are often provoked by stress, postural changes, and physical activity as in this patient. This is further reinforced by the lack of features suggestive of other conditions such as weight loss (common in adrenal carcinoma), hypertension (common in aldosterone-producing adenomas), or genetic syndromes. Consequently, the next step in management should be an imaging study like a CT or MRI scan to locate the tumor.

884
C: Refer to an oral surgeon for excision

Explanation: This oral mass presents with characteristics such as rapid growth, bleeding, and size, indicating the need for further diagnostic evaluation. Performing a simple needle biopsy may not yield an adequate sample due to the friable nature of the lesion. On the other hand, recommending watchful waiting might likely lead to further growth or complications of the lesion, potentially interfering with dental hygiene and nutritional intake. Furthermore, prescribing a course of prednisone for a undiagnosed oral lesion without clear evidence of an inflammatory or autoimmune disease may lead to unnecessary exposure to systemic steroids during pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to refer the patient to an oral surgeon for a planned excision. The excised mass can then be examined histologically to reach a definitive diagnosis.

885
C: Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy

Explanation: The patient has a large adrenal tumor that's demonstrated marked 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake. Despite the patient being asymptomatic, the radiological features of the tumor suggest malignancy; the size (>4 cm), irregular margins, heterogeneous appearance and high FDG uptake are typical for malignant tumors. Relative and absolute adrenal washout values are of limited diagnostic value in this setting. The patient's adrenal hormones are normal, ruling out a functional adrenal tumor.
A biopsy is not recommended due to the risk of tumor spread along the needle tract and unavailability of potential therapeutic implication. The next step is not to watch and wait (repeat CT in 3-6 months) for potential adverse consequences of a growing malignancy. Similarly, additional imaging with adrenal MRI is unlikely to provide more helpful information, given the concerning features on the initial CT scan. Therefore, referring the patient to a surgeon for consideration of an adrenalectomy is the most appropriate next step. This would allow for removal of the potential malignant mass and also definitive diagnosis through postoperative pathology.

886
C: Septic emboli

Explanation: The patient's presentation with systemic symptoms, such as leukocytosis and encephalopathy, as well as his cutaneous signs, such as petechiae, palpable purpura, and hemorrhagic vesicles, is suggestive of a septic condition. The results of the transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were negative, ruling out causes like endocarditis or other cardiac sources of embolism. Nonetheless, the presence of pustules and a progressing cutaneous eruption indicate an ongoing infection. More specifically, the presence of septic emboli—fragments of infected material spread through the bloodstream—would be congruent with this patient's symptoms and has been confirmed by histopathological findings showing vascular thrombosis and extramural fibrin deposition. Although the mentioned infections can also cause skin manifestations, the widespread petechiae and purpura, together with his systemic symptoms and biopsy findings, point more strongly to septic emboli.

D: Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma

Explanation: Schneiderian papillomas, also known as sinonasal papillomas, are benign neoplasms that arise from the Schneiderian epithelium lining the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. They are known for their distinctive histology which includes both squamous and mucinous or goblet cells, matching those observed in C, and D of the given case. The lack of cytologic atypia or atypical mitotic figures help exclude the aggressive neoplasms like exophytic squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, the slow growth without respiratory obstruction suggests a more benign pathology, hence pointing toward the diagnosis of an Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma.

888
B: Mycobacterium marinum

Explanation: The woman's history of exposure to freshwater, the appearance and sporotrichoid spread of the crusted papules and pustules on her leg, and the failure of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory treatments all suggest a diagnosis of atypical mycobacterial infection. Mycobacterium marinum is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium that is found in freshwater and saltwater environments, and can cause skin and soft tissue infections. The diagnosis can be confirmed by positive culture results, however, cultures require a few weeks to grow. Therefore, clinical suspicion on history and physical examination is paramount. This entity can be confused with sporotrichosis, which also has a sporotrichoid spread but is usually acquired by inoculation from plant material, not water exposure. The patient is not responding to antibacterial treatment, making bacterial folliculitis and cellulitis unlikely. Majocchi granuloma, a deep folliculitis caused by dermatophytic fungi, often after steroid use, is also less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

B: Pustular psoriasis

Explanation: The child's symmetrical rash involving the intertriginous regions, along with the neutrophil-rich dermal and epidermal infiltrate on biopsy, is suggestive of pustular psoriasis. An onset at such a young age is rare but has been reported. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis would more typically involve the trunk and face and include fever and leukocytosis. Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), also manifests as a neutrophilic dermatosis, however, it begins as early as the first week of life. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome typically presents with periorificial involvement and diffuse tender erythema, with subsequent exfoliation and positive staphylococcal cultures.

890
D: Metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings are most consistent with metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary. Lytic bone lesions are indicative of destruction of the normal bone architecture, often due to tumors. Primary tumors that commonly metastasize to bone include those of the breast, prostate, thyroid, lung, and kidney. However, in some cases, despite extensive investigation, the primary site of a metastatic tumor cannot be identified at the time of diagnosis, hence the term "unknown primary". The differential diagnosis does include giant cell tumor and reparative granuloma, both are rare and typically occur in younger patients. Brown tumor is associated with hyperparathyroidism, which does not seem to be presented in this case. Hence, option D seems the most plausible in context. However, final diagnosis should be confirmed by histopathological examination.
C

891
C: A recurrent herpetic whitlow

Explanation: The history of the case as well as the recurrent nature of the lesion suggests a recurrent herpetic whitlow, a viral infection of the finger caused by the herpes simplex virus. It often develops after direct contact with the mouth or infected body fluids, which might have happened when the patient unintentionally got exposed to blood with a blade used for surgical purposes. In the given case, other suggested conditions - a foreign body reaction, an osteitis, or bacterial cellulitis - do not align with the presentation of recurring abscess in the finger. This is especially relevant considering that bacteriological swabs turned out sterile. Also, antibiotics that can usually improve these kinds of bacterial infections did not show any improvement. This leads to the best fitting diagnosis of the recurrent herpetic whitlow.
C

892
B

Explanation: The patient's decreased vision is attributed to the retinal abnormalities visible in the fundus photographs, most conspicuous of which are the prominent flame hemorrhages and macular edema. The elevated central macular thickness also confirms macular edema. The lack of other symptoms such as headache or pain, points away from conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The presence of hyperemic discs, macular edema and prominent flame-shaped hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants suggests an underlying vascular condition. Furthermore, the heterozygosity in the R506Q mutation of factor V Leiden along with decreased protein S level do suggest an abnormal blood coagulation pathway. Therefore, referring the patient to a hematology service for a potential anticoagulation therapy would be the most suitable next step. Intravitreous injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor is typically used in cases of neovascularization which is not evident here. Similarly, panretinal photocoagulation is usually a measure taken for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, but the absence of microaneurysms, exudates, and neovascularization makes it an inappropriate option in this case.
A: Cholesterol granuloma

Explanation: The diagnosis of a cholesterol granuloma is primarily radiographic and is based on the presence of the characteristic golden-brown fluid within a cystic mass, as observed in this case. Cholesterol granuloma of the petrous apex is a rare entity that results from chronic inflammation and repeated episodes of hemorrhage within pneumatized petrous apices, with consequent cholesterol crystal deposition. The lesion is often slow-growing and may present with various symptoms based on its size and proximity to surrounding structures. The management of this condition is typically surgical with the intent of drainage and decompression. Other answer choices, like mucocele, chondrosarcoma and chordoma, do not commonly present with these distinctive features.
A
894
B: Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia

Explanation: The clinical history of chronic otorrhea and unilateral hearing loss due to a bloody discharge from the left ear in a patient previously diagnosed and treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), along with CT findings of near-complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells, indicates a case of extramedullary manifestation of CLL. This is also supported by the pathology findings of numerous small basophilic cells that are CD20 positive and CD3 negative. While the other options might present with similar symptoms, the combination of the patient's history of CLL, the findings from the CT scan, and the evidence from the cytopathologic examination make it clear that this is a case of extramedullary CLL.
B
895
A: Intraosseous meningioma

Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case are suggestive of an intraosseous meningioma. This condition typically presents with symptoms related to mass effect, such as proptosis, and can also cause pain and changes in sensation. On imaging, intraosseous meningiomas are characterized by hyperostosis, or thickening of the bone, and a mass that enhances with contrast. The finding of lobules and whorls of spindle cells on pathology is also consistent with this diagnosis. Intraosseous meningiomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the meninges, or coverings of the brain and spinal cord, and can invade and cause expansion of the overlying bone. This contrasts with the other options, which are less likely given the findings in this case: a mucocele would be expected to cause bone erosion rather than hyperostosis; fibrous dysplasia is typically a painless, slow-growing mass that does not cause local symptoms; and osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, is highly aggressive and would be expected to cause more widespread destruction of the bone.
A
896
A: Pseudoaneurysm

Explanation: The finding of a hyperdense mass with a density identical to that of the vasculature on a CT scan, associated with sudden onset neck swelling, pain, and respiratory distress aligns with a diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm. A pseudoaneurysm is a hematoma that forms as the result of a leaking hole in an artery. The blood-filled cavity will eventually form a connection with the artery, leading to the pulsating hematoma. The sudden onset of symptoms in this patient may have been triggered by a rise in blood pressure or a straining action during basketball play. The other options (Parapharyngeal abscess, Paraganglioma, Venolymphatic malformation) are far less likely based on the provided clinical and radiological findings.
A
897
C: Serologic testing. 

Explanation: Given the patient's status as HIV-positive, painless vision loss, and physical examination findings, it would be important to rule out diseases that can appear with immunosuppression. The ocular findings suggesting retinal damage align with infectious diseases that can be detected through serologic testing. Testing can include syphilis, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis among others. These diseases are treatable and can prevent further visual loss. The other options, while potentially valid in other cases, may not provide as immediate or clear information for this particular case. For example, an MRI or a biopsy would be invasive and may not yield necessary immediate results. Systemic antimicrobial treatment should ideally be initiated once a clear diagnosis is established.

I would choose the option A: Order human immunodeficiency virus serologies. 

Explanation: The history of altered mental status in a relatively young patient, coupled with the acute onset of bilateral decreased vision, and fundus findings suggestive of retinal ischemia (as indicated by areas of retinal whitening and corresponding hypofluorescence on angiography) strongly suggest an underlying systemic condition. The presence of retinal whitening which is typically associated with retinal infarctions, often occur due to opportunistic infections in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS, hence the recommendation to perform HIV serologies. Other choices, while important, may not be as directly relevant to the patient’s presentation as HIV serologies.

B: Initiate radiation therapy with plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy

Explanation: 
Given the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings and history of cutaneous melanoma, a diagnosis of iris melanoma is highly suspected. Given the high likelihood of malignancy, a transvitreal biopsy of the tumor (Option A) is not needed. Iris melanomas typically demonstrate a high rate of localized tumor control and eye preservation after treatment with radiation therapy, either by plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy (Option B). Iridocyclectomy (Option C) and enucleation with orbital implant (Option D) are typically reserved for cases in which the tumor is unresponsive to conservative therapy, or when the tumor has grown to an extent where they threaten the integrity of the eye and the vision of the patient. Considering all of these, starting radiation therapy with plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy (Option B) would be the more appropriate initial step in management.

A

Explanation: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a mutation in the FLT3 gene, specifically the presence of an internal tandem duplication (ITD), is associated with a worse prognosis. This is irrespective of the length of the duplication or the mutation burden. Thus, this patient is more likely to have a worse prognosis. FLT3-ITD mutations have been related to a higher relapse rate and poorer overall survival rates in patients with AML. It is considered one of the significant adverse prognostic factors in AML. Hence, despite having a normal karyotype, the FLT3-ITD mutation will predict greater risk and worse outcome.
C: Perform direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy.

Explanation: 
Given the presence of palpable purpura, a DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy is indicated. This can help identify immunoglobulins, complement, or fibrinogen, which can point towards an immunologic etiology for the rash, such as vasculitis. Infectious serologies may be helpful in certain cases, but the absence of fever or systemic signs of infection makes an infectious etiology less likely. Checking ANA and a slower steroid taper are reasonable considerations for some cases, but again, without evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disorder, the ANA test might have low yield. An improved steroid response with slow taper might be observed but would not change the underlying diagnosis or management. Therefore, in a case with non-blanchable purpuric rash, it would be advisable to first perform DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy to identify the possible immune-related cause.

A

Explanation: From the clinical history provided, it appears that the patient has developed an unprovoked hepatic and portal vein thrombosis following a recent surgery, along with a new onset of ascites. The laboratory results indicate a JAK2 V617F mutation which is typically associated with Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These include conditions like polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis. Thus, this clinical scenario strongly suggests a diagnosis of a MPN, likely secondary to the JAK2 mutation. The other options B, C, and D do not fit the clinical picture as well as a diagnosis of MPN.
D: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

Explanation: The presence of easily bruised skin since birth, cutaneous findings of annular plaques with skin atrophy, along with the morpheaform facial changes suggest Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This disease is characterized by skin hyperextensibility, cutaneous fragility leading to bruising, poor healing, and the potential for severe arterial, uterine and hollow organ fragility. 

The punch biopsy finding of transepidermal elimination of elastic fibers stained with Verhoeff-van Gieson further points to a diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa, which is associated with an array of conditions, including penicillamine use, Down syndrome, and, relevant in this case, inherited disorders of connective tissue such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This combination of the two conditions is rare but not unheard of, leading to the conclusion of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

B: Umbilical mucosal polyp.

Explanation: The 8-month-old baby boy has a red, bleeding umbilical mass present since the loss of the umbilical stump. The facts that the lesion was not responsive to previous treatments and the histologic analysis showing colonic mucosa suggests that the condition is not pyogenic granuloma or infantile hemangioma. The presence of the colonic mucosa and absence of any symptom of occlusion or infection rules out the possibility of an umbilical hernia and patent urachus. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case would be an umbilical mucosal polyp. This condition is quite rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions in the umbilical area that do not respond to common treatment protocols.

905
C: Amyloidosis

Explanation: The skin findings of purpura and waxy yellow papules and plaques, plus abnormal liver function results and renal impairment with proteinuria, are indicative of systemic amyloidosis. Purpura in amyloidosis is typically due to the fragility of blood vessels, and periocular involvement is characteristic. In addition, the yellow skin discoloration is due to the deposition of amyloid in the skin. The staining with Congo red and the appearance under polarized microscopy of the punch biopsy specimen are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The normal serum and urine protein electrophoresis results suggest that it's not associated with a paraproteinemia, like myeloma. Therefore, the correct answer should be C: Amyloidosis.

B: Mycotic meningomyelitis. 

Explanation: The patient's occupation (contact with moist earth), the decrease in glucose level in cerebrospinal fluid, and the absence of identifying organisms on stain suggest a fungal infection. The absence of evidence for other pathogens or systemic diseases also supports this diagnosis. The multiple intramedullary lesions seen on the MRI, along with the patient's neurological symptoms suggest meningomyelitis. The normal brain MRI and absence of HIV, tuberculosis, or syphilis in the patient's blood also point towards this diagnosis.

907
D: Oral lymphangioma. 

Explanation: Oral lymphangioma presents as asymptomatic, soft, and elevated nodules that may have a pebbly surface. They are usually pale but may also appear pink or red. Often presenting at birth or early childhood, these lesions arise due to malformation of the lymphatic vessels. Even though they may temporarily increase in size, typically during upper respiratory infections due to a secondary obstruction of drainage, they are not related to fever or other rashes. Unlike herpes simplex virus infection, the lesions in oral lymphangioma do not typically increase in relation to fever and they do not burst or become ulcerated. Mucoceles are usually solitary and located on the lower lip. While neurofibromatosis type 1 could theoretically cause tongue masses, these would not resolve and reappear spontaneously, which is also the reason these lesions are unlikely to be mucocele or neurofibromatosis type 1. Based on these features, the patient’s clinical history, and lesion characteristics, a diagnosis of oral lymphangioma is most appropriate. The recurring nature and spontaneous resolution of the patient's tongue masses, their colour, and location are consistent with a diagnosis of oral lymphangioma.

C: Sigmoid volvulus

Explanation: The symptoms exhibited by the patient, such as progressive abdominal distension and tenderness, alongside the results of the investigations, a huge colonic distension visible on plain abdominal radiograph, and the apparent "bent inner tube" or "coffee bean sign" seen on the CT scan, are clinically classic for sigmoid volvulus. Additionally, this diagnosis is more likely considering the patient's age and status as institutionalized and bedridden. In contrast, cecal volvulus typically presents differently on imaging, aerophagia does not usually cause large-bowel obstruction, and Ogilvie syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) generally presents with a more meteorism and less severe, gradual onset. Hence, sigmoid volvulus is the most likely diagnosis.

B: Small-bowel intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions

Explanation: The case involves a 45-old-year woman presenting with symptoms indicative of a small bowel obstruction. Considering her history of abdominal surgical procedures involving the pelvis, it's plausible the obstruction could be due to pelvic adhesions, which are common after abdominal surgeries. Intussusception occurs when a part of the intestine invaginates into another part, causing a blockage. As for the other options, she has no symptoms directly suggestive of lung cancer, a phytobezoar (indigestible mass in the gastrointestinal system) typically presents with symptoms over time rather than the sudden onset described here, and her past surgeries including hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy make endometriosis unlikely. The imaging features seen fit better with intussusception rather than the other options. Hence, the most likely diagnosis is Small-bowel intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions.

A: Medical therapy with β-blocker, nifedipine, long-acting nitrate, and flecainide acetate.

Explanation: Considering the patient's presenting symptoms and condition, the most suitable treatment option would be to start with a thorough medical therapy to regulate the heart rhythm and manage the hypertension. β-blockers would be administered to manage the premature ventricular contractions and hypertension, nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) can be used for angina as it helps to relax and widen blood vessels in the heart, long-acting nitrates will be effective for coronary artery disease, preventing angina attacks, and flecainide acetate as an antiarrhythmic agent. Current evidence and guidelines mandate medical therapy as first-line treatment before considering invasive procedures.

C: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).

Explanation: While a laboratory error (Option A) is always a possibility, it seems less likely given the repeat tests showing consistent discordance. Similarly, excess VLDL cholesterol alone (Option D) would typically not result in such a large discrepancy between direct and calculated LDL-C levels. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (Option B) is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents with a different lipid profile pattern. On the other hand, Option C combines possible effects of multiple lipid factors (VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a)) that could conceivably lead to such discordance. Both directly measured and calculated LDL cholesterol levels reflects different elements of the circulating LDL particles, and the inconsistency might result from high levels of Lp(a), as Lp(a) carries cholesterol that is counted as LDL cholesterol in the calculated LDL-C, but not in the directly measured LDL-C. Thus, the conflicting LDL-C levels in this patient were primarily due to an elevated Lp(a) level. Finally, the patient's profile (persistent high LDL-C levels despite statin therapy, hypertension, diabetes) is also in line with possibly having an elevated Lp(a), which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.

C: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma

Explanation: Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a low-grade malignant tumor that typically presents in the fifth to sixth decade of life with unilateral sinonasal symptoms. This diagnosis is supported by the location of the tumor, the presence of a spindle cell neoplasm with neural and myogenic differentiation (S-100 protein and smooth muscle markers positive), and the immunohistochemical staining pattern, including strong nuclear and cytoplasmic reactivity for S-100, patchy reactivity for smooth muscle actin, and cytoplasmic reactivity for β-catenin. The absence of epithelial differentiation (EMA nonreactive) makes the diagnosis of a synovial sarcoma less likely. A low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor typically presents in association with neurofibromatosis type 1, which does not seem to be the case in our patient. Glomangiopericytoma is a sinonasal tumor with a perivascular myoid phenotype expressing smooth muscle markers, often associated with prominent vascularization and a lobular growth pattern, which is different from the pathologic findings in our patient.

B: Ameloblastoma 

Explanation: The given MRI features such as a mass lying on the anterior surface of the eroded left mandibular condyle showing homogeneous isointensity relative to skeletal muscle, homogeneous avid enhancement after contrast administration, with a moderately hyperintense signal on T2-weighted image and marked diffusion restriction all indicate a solid tumor arising from the mandible. These features are more suggestive of an Ameloblastoma, which is a benign but locally aggressive odontogenic tumor that originates from the odontogenic epithelium. Plasmacytoma typically presents with lytic lesions and osteosarcoma is usually associated with new bone formation or a sunburst pattern. Venous malformation, a vascular lesion, presents with flow voids or phleboliths, none of which have been mentioned in this case.

914
C: Acinic cell carcinoma

Explanation: The presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with acinic cell carcinoma. Acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is characterized by serous acinar cell differentiation. In this case, this diagnosis is supported by the fact that dark, granular, basophilic acinar cells have periodic acid-Schiff positive, diastase-resistant intracytoplasmic granules. Eosinophilic ductal cells were also observed, which are another key feature of this type of carcinoma. The tumor is usually encapsulated, as described in this case, and often exhibits focal areas of sclerosis, hemorrhage, and cystic spaces. Furthermore, acinic cell carcinoma can sometimes show local calcification, similar to the 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4-cm area of calcification observed in the periphery of this tumor.

A: Esthesioneuroblastoma

Explanation:
Esthesioneuroblastoma, also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare malignant neoplasm that originates in the olfactory epithelium of the upper nasal cavity. Clinically, patients might present with symptoms similar to the case in discussion such as unilateral nasal obstruction, anosmia; in advanced cases proptosis, pain, and decreased vision acuity might also be present, all of which closely aligns with our patient’s symptoms. The radiology results are also supportive as Esthesioneuroblastomas generally appear as homogenous masses which can extend into the ethmoid sinuses and orbit as in this case. On the other hand, a rhabdomyosarcoma usually presents with rapid onset unilateral proptosis in children and is often associated with pain. Ethmoid mucocele and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma present with similar symptoms but in adults and elderly patients, respectively, and the radiological evidence in this case does not exactly match these topics. Finally, biopsy which is considered the gold standard for definitive diagnosis was done in this case and can help differentiate between these conditions.

916
C

Explanation: Given the findings such as headache, blurry vision, nausea and neuro-ophthalmic signs such as optic disc swelling along with normal MRI brain scan, the suggested next step would be to perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis (option C). This is because her symptoms could be indications of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), previously known as pseudotumor cerebri. IIH can mimic the symptoms of a brain tumor but no brain tumor is present. The most definitive test for diagnosing IIH is a lumbar puncture. The surrounding conditions related to the patient like obesity, systemic hypertension, and taking fluoxetine are the known risk factors of IIH. So the lumbar puncture will help confirm the diagnosis.  Other options might not be appropriate at this stage: while conservative treatment of the headache (option A) alone might not resolve the underlying issue which could be IIH, surgical intervention (option B) could be premature without a conclusive diagnosis, and the use of high-dose corticosteroids (option D) might worsen her conditions if she indeed has IIH, as steroids are known to increase cranial pressure.
B: Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion

Explanation: The unusual corneal degeneration in this case requires further investigation. Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion can help identify potential external factors contributing to corneal thinning and deposits, such as exposure from lid abnormalities, meibomian gland dysfunction, or foreign bodies. Though treatments like subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication or crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty might eventually be considered, it is essential first to have a clear understanding of the underlying cause rather than solely addressing the corneal changes. Eyelid eversion could store valuable diagnostic information, especially considering that no other abnormalities were reported initially. Refraction with a rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting may help correct vision but will not address the core issue causing the corneal degeneration.

A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with a known, albeit rare, adverse reaction to intravenous bisphosphonate therapy namely, bisphosphonate-associated uveitis (BAU). BAU can present like any other anterior uveitis but tends to occur quite acutely following bisphosphonate therapy (24-72 hours) and is particularly associated with the first dose. Given that the patient had a severe reaction to the zoledronic acid, it would be advisable to avoid re-challenging the patient with the same medication and hence, to request the endocrinologist to find an alternative treatment for Paget's disease. Managing proactively or treating as a generic uveitis doesn't take the underlying cause (the drug reaction) into account and could lead to a recurrence of the symptoms.
C: Perform bedside incision and drainage of the blisters and admit for intravenous antibiotics

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF), a serious bacterial skin infection that spreads quickly and kills the body's soft tissue. Due to the patient's systemic symptoms such as tachycardia and fever, this could be possibly a septic shock. Direct incision and drainage of the blisters can reduce local inflammation and improve clinical outcome. Furthermore, it can provide material for culture to identify the causative organism, guiding further management with antibiotic therapy. Intravenous antibiotics are necessary due to the severity of the situation and to halt any progression of the infection, making hospital admission essential. Starting IV antibiotics as soon as possible can help avoid systemic illness and complications. The patient’s condition might deteriorate without immediate medical intervention, potentially to loss of vision, orbital cellulitis, or even death from overwhelming sepsis. Discharging home or simply starting oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis is too risky and might not control the infection effectively. Surgical intervention may not be needed immediately unless there is evidence of necrosis or abscess formation.

C: Osteosarcoma metastasis

Explanation: Although each option is a potential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging thyroid mass, the patient's medical history of high-grade osteosarcoma associated with positive p53 and vimentin staining favors a diagnosis of osteosarcoma metastasis. The negative staining for S-100 rules out thyroid lymphoma. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma would present with positivity for TTF-1, which in this case was negative. Finally, squamous cell carcinoma metastasis would usually present with prior cervical lymphadenopathy which the patient doesn't have. Therefore, the answer is Osteosarcoma metastasis.

C: Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

Explanation: The infant presents with several clinical manifestations including fever, rash, and anemia. Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and physical examination results, the most appropriate next step is to investigate the possibility of an autoimmune disease or a congenital infection. Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-Ro, and anti-La are seen in autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome, conditions that can present with similar symptoms in infants if the mother is also affected. Additionally, these tests can help rule in or out neonatal lupus erythematosus which can present similarly. Providing proper facial cleansing and moisturizing (Option A) is good for skin health but does not address the underlying problem. Administering topical antifungals (Option B) is not indicated as there is no evidence of a fungal infection. A serologic test for syphilis (Option D) is also not the best next step as the mother tested negative for syphilis during prenatal screening.

922
B: Cutaneous malakoplakia

Explanation: Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare granulomatous disorder that often presents as yellowish plaques or nodules in the genital area. It is typically associated with immunosuppressed states, which fits this patient's history of chronic graft-vs-host disease and bone marrow transplant. In addition, her clinical presentation with yellow-colored nodules, some of which are ulcerated with a yellow discharge, is characteristic of malakoplakia. The condition occurs due to defective macrophage response to bacteria, resulting in accumulation of distinctive intracellular inclusions. Although the other options can present with cutaneous nodules in a similar population, the specific presentation and location in this patient makes malakoplakia a more probable diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis would require a tissue biopsy and histological confirmation.

923
C: Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia

Explanation: The patient has a history of discoid lupus, but there was no mention of systemic symptoms usually associated with lupus, which might indicate option A. Eruptive keratoacanthomas (B) is also unlikely, as those tend to present with multiple, rapidly growing nodules, not the case here. Sarcoidosis (D) can manifest in tattoos, but it's usually associated with systemic symptoms, not merely local reactions. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (C) would fit best with the symptoms and history: localized, growing nodules limited to the area of white and red ink (common culprits for allergic reactions) layering in her tattoo. This condition is a benign proliferation of squamous cells often in response to inflammatory stimuli and is known to mimic squamous cell carcinomas histologically. The histology along with the course of the disease point towards pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. The patient should be monitored, given the benign nature of the condition, but any changes to the nodules should warrant further investigation.

C: Rowell syndrome. 

Explanation: The diagnosis of Rowell syndrome was made based on the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus band test positivity, and the appearance of erythema multiforme–like lesions. In addition, she was positive for speckled antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and anti-Ro, fulfilling the original criteria established by Rowell et al in 1963 and which are associated with the syndrome. The diagnosis of Rowell syndrome remains controversial, but we believe that its existence as a distinct clinical entity is better supported by the literature. The presence of an underlying disease, namely SLE, provides an anchor diagnosis that can explain many features of the syndrome, including the erythema multiforme–like lesions, bullae, and other mucocutaneous lesions. The presence of infection and/or recent medication change suggests possible triggers for the atypical immunological response. Treatment for Rowell syndrome includes systemic corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. In severe cases, immune modulatory therapy, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, can also be considered.

925
D: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1.

Explanation: The symptoms this patient experienced, including dysarthria, dysphagia, limb weakness, cavus feet, and reduced motor nerve conduction velocity, are all indicative of peripheral neuropathy. In addition, cerebral white matter abnormalities on MRI and a notable regression in neuropathic symptoms align with a diagnosis of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1 (CMTX1). CMTX1 is an inherited neuropathy characterized by diminished nerve conduction velocities and transient central nervous system symptoms such as those this patient experienced. Negative oligonucleotide bands and aquaporin 4 detection rule out multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, transient ischemic attack would likely show a vascular lesion on angiography or cerebral MRI, which wasn't present in this case. Lastly, periodic paralysis wouldn't exhibit white matter lesions in brain images.

926
B: Ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve

Explanation: The history and examination presented are consistent with ocular neuromyotonia, a rare condition typically associated with previous cranial radiotherapy. The syndrome is characterized by intermittent, prolonged involuntary contraction of one or more of the extra ocular muscles. This is due to hypersensitive ion channels in the nerve fibers to the extra ocular muscles, which makes them susceptible to prolonged depolarization. This particular case is likely due to her history of pituitary macroadenoma with surgery and radiation. Ocular myasthenia typically shows variability and fatigability with prolonged up gaze, neither of which is evident in this case. Giant cell arteritis typically presents in a different demographic, with pain and other systemic symptoms. Cavernous sinus syndrome usually presents with multiple cranial neuropathies and signs of other cranial nerves being affected, which are not present with this patient.

C: Fragile X–associated tremor ataxia syndrome

Explanation: The symptoms described such as action tremor, impaired balance, and executive dysfunction are symbol of Fragile X–associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Other symptoms such as jerky eye pursuit, saccadic dysmetria, mild rigidity, and slurred speech further strengthen this diagnosis. FXTAS is a genetic condition that affects the nervous system and leads to issues with movement and cognition. Furthermore, the brain MRI results showing volume loss in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum, as well as abnormal signal intensity in the cerebral hemispheric white matter and middle cerebellar peduncles, align with the typical imaging results observed in FXTAS. It does not necessarily signify that the patient would have family history of neurological disorders, since it can often involve new mutations, not seen in prior generations. Additionally, the age of onset matches with the condition, which typically affects individuals in their 50s.

928
B: Spinal dysraphism

Explanation: The presence of the red patch, soft nodule and pedunculated red papule on the lower back of the neonate could be indicative of a cutaneous sign of spinal dysraphism. These are conditions that result from the malformation of the embryonic neural tube. They often present with cutaneous signs like the child's. The fact that the baby is otherwise healthy and moving all her limbs normally also supports this diagnosis, as spinal dysraphism could be present without other evident neurological issues. The normal prenatal screens can also fit with spinal dysraphism, as sometimes cases might go unnoticed during the prenatal screening depending on the specific nature of the defect. Hence, despite the ultrasound results, more detailed MRI scanning may be necessary for final diagnosis.

C: Begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day

Explanation: The patient in the mentioned case has PSC with severe hypercholesterolemia, particularly high unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids levels, which are indicative of Lipoprotein X (LpX) dyslipidemia. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) along with rosuvastatin treatment is the optimal and preferred therapeutic intervention for managing LpX associated dyslipidemia, as it works by directly removing the abundant lipoproteins and provides better control of plasma lipid levels. Additionally, rosuvastatin contributes to the reduction of cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, a synergistic approach utilizing both TPE and rosuvastatin would be most effective in treating this patient's elevated cholesterol levels, improving her overall hepatic function, and ultimately her quality of life. It's important to note that ongoing monitoring of the patient's cholesterol levels and liver function will be needed to ensure treatment efficacy and manage potential side effects.

C: Begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day.

Explanation: The patient has extremely high levels of cholesterol suggestive of severe hypercholesterolemia, possibly exacerbated by her PSC condition. Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) is typically used in the treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia to rapidly lower cholesterol levels and reduce risk of atherosclerotic disease. Concurrently, statins such as rosuvastatin are often used as they reduce cholesterol production in the liver. Using both TPE and rosuvastatin in combination can provide an immediate, significant reduction in cholesterol (via TPE) while also providing a long-term management approach (via rosuvastatin). Other options like resolving obstructive cholestasis with biliary stent placement may be relevant to her PSC condition but does not directly address the severe hypercholesterolemia.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day

Explanation: This woman has severe hypercholesterolemia with unique lipoprotein abnormalities secondary to cholestasis from advanced PSC. The majority of her TC (719 mg/dL) is free cholesterol (518 mg/dL) instead of the usual esterified cholesterol which is a characteristic of LpX. Gel filtration studies show her predominant lipoprotein abnormality is LpX. LpX has unique physical properties, including high phospholipids and cholesterol with low lipid-free apolipoprotein; it is often associated with cholestasis. In cholestatic patients, LpX is thought to originate from the liver or bile due to blocked transport of biliary phospholipids into the intestine. In this context, treatment includes reducing the cholestasis and clearing the LpX. Biliary stent placement (option A) may temporize decompression of biliary obstruction but does not address her LpX or severe hypercholesterolemia. Rosuvastatin alone (option B) is not sufficient to reduce her severe hypercholesterolemia due to advanced PSC. Therapeutic plasma exchange would both reduce the cholesterol burden and clear the abnormal lipoprotein particles. Therefore, therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day (option C), is the appropriate choice. Starting therapeutic plasma exchange only (option D) may not be sufficient to control her severe hypercholesterolemia.

A: Middle ear paraganglioma

Explanation: Middle ear paraganglioma also known as a glomus tympanicum tumor, is a slow-growing, benign neuroendocrine tumor. It originates from paraganglion cells along the course of the Jacobson’s nerve, a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), in the middle ear. Its symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, and sometimes, vertigo due to its proximity to the vestibular apparatus. In this specific case, the elderly woman's clinical history, her imagery findings (i.e., the mass emanating from the middle ear involving the facial canal with surrounding bony erosion), and especially the immunohistochemical stains results that indicate synaptophysin positive cells with a sustentacular pattern of cells positive for S-100 strongly support the diagnosis of a paraganglioma. The other options (Facial nerve hemangioma, Facial nerve schwannoma, and Middle ear adenoma) can be ruled out due to the sustentacular pattern of S-100 positive cells, a characteristic feature of paragangliomas. Also, these other options would be less likely to cause vertigo.

D: Oral inverted ductal papilloma. 

Explanation: The histological aspects detailed in the case description resemble the distinctive characteristics of an oral inverted ductal papilloma. The lesion displays endophytic growth, epidermoid cells with occasional columnar appearances organized in broad papillary folds, mucocytes dispersed and in small acinar structures, along with an infiltrating border, all of which suggest an inverted ductal papillary growth. The lack of cellular atypia or mitotic figures makes malignancies like mucoepidermoid carcinoma less likely. The case does not provide the typical traumatic or obstructive glandular duct scenario that might suggest mucocele. In contrast, an intraductal papilloma would typically not present the acanthotic and infiltrative patterns depicted.

D
932
B: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma

Explanation: The main points hinting at Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) are the patient's gender and age, the location of the mass observed during the physical examination and confirmed by CT and MRI imaging, and symptoms such as facial pain, fullness, trismus, and decreased acuity in his left lower visual field. JNA commonly presents in late adolescence and primarily affects males, as it does in this case. In addition, the CT and MRI scans show a mass in the left infratemporal fossa extending into nasal cavity, maxillary sinus and inferior orbital fissure. The signal intensity patterns, particularly the 'salt and pepper' appearance, could suggest a vascular tumor like JNA. The term 'salt and pepper' appearance is used to describe a mixture of high and low signal intensities within a mass on MRI and is often associated with vascular tumors due to the presence of flow voids (the 'pepper') representing fast flowing blood within large vascular channels, and high signal areas (the 'salt') representing slow flowing blood within either smaller vascular channels or areas of hemorrhage.
B
933
A: Venous malformation

Explanation: The MRI findings described in the case provide key to the diagnosis. The T2 hyperintense lesion involving the left parotid gland that becomes more prominent with Valsalva maneuver is consistent with venous malformations (VM). VM are the most common slow-flow vascular malformation and can present with symptoms such as pain and swelling, which are usually triggered by factors that increase venous pressure, such as Valsalva maneuver (like in this patient) or during sleep. Moreover, they are usually compressible and can expand during maneuvers that increase intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pressure. The ultrasound was negative likely due to the intermittent nature of the swelling and its dependency on intravascular pressure. This further supports the diagnosis of a VM.
A
934
B: Refer to neurology department

Explanation: Given the child's recent history of upper respiratory infection, fever, headaches, the new onset of diplopia, and bilateral blurred nasal margins of the optic discs, there is a high suspicion for increased intracranial pressure which requires immediate neurologic attention. While continuing antibiotics and neuroimaging can be part of the management plan, they should ideally be done in a coordinated manner under the guidance of a neurologist. Strabismus surgery is not immediately indicated as it wouldn't address the underlying issue, and could potentially delay necessary neurological evaluation and treatment. The child should ideally be referred to a neurology department for immediate assessment and management.

C: Electrophysiology

Explanation: Given the unremarkable results of fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence and the patient’s history, it is crucial to understand what is happening at the neuronal level. Electrophysiology would help discern what level of the retina or optic nerve is affected by the condition. Uveitis seems less likely given the absence of inflammation in the anterior segment or anterior vitreous. Looking at orbital imaging does not seem helpful at this stage, as the optic nerve head appears normal. Oral prednisone might not be the best first step without a specific diagnosis or evidence of inflammation.

B: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral vision loss, ear pain, hearing loss, severe headache, and elevated inflammatory markers are suggestive of a systemic inflammatory process. His history of hypertension and sleep apnea, together with the evidence of pachymeningeal enhancement and optic nerve enhancement on MRI, further support a possible diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). One of the diagnostic tools for GPA is the Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing (option B) which identifies autoantibodies produced by the body, thus further confirming this immunological process. The other tests mentioned (Quantiferon gold, Rapid plasma reagin, or Angiotensin-converting enzyme level) would not yield the necessary information to continue the diagnostic process in this case.

B

Explanation: This patient's clinical features are consistent with Susac syndrome, a rare autoimmune endotheliopathy that results in a clinical triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss, and retinal artery occlusions. The disease affects mostly women in their third decade of life and is characterized by microangiopathy affecting the brain, cochlea, and retina. The brain findings can involve the corpus callosum, as well as the subcortical white matter. Involvement of the retinal arteries can cause acute vision loss due to infarction of the posterior pole, while the cochlear artery involvement presents as low frequency hearing loss. Treatment typically involves systemic steroids and immunosuppression to reduce inflammation and prevent further attacks. However, it's a progressive disorder requiring long-term therapy to reduce relapses and manage residual deficits. Therefore, the option 'Administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression for Susac syndrome' is the most appropriate treatment plan for this patient.
D: Diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta.

Explanation: The patient's chest radiograph showed a marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, an indication of possible diaphragmatic rupture common in high-speed motor vehicle collisions. Moreover, the patient's hypotension despite fluid resuscitation suggests significant internal bleeding. Thus, a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta (a major vessel) could be causing the internal bleeding. The other options are less likely as there are no signs of pneumothorax or mediastinal hematoma, and the scenario does not support diaphragmatic eventration.

C: Sigmoid endometriosis

Explanation: The patient's prior history of menorrhagia, hysterectomy, repeated episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding approximately every 3-4 months, and the finding of an exquisitely painful nodule at the rectosigmoid junction - which aligns with her menstrual cycle - suggest a diagnosis of sigmoid endometriosis. Endometriosis is a disorder where the tissue that normally lines the uterus - the endometrium - grows outside the uterus. When it involves the sigmoid colon, it can cause symptoms such as those seen in this patient. This condition can often be challenging to diagnose as endometrial lesions can appear normal on histology if the biopsy does not capture them. Although other conditions such as sigmoid adenocarcinoma or rectosigmoid leiomyoma could theoretically cause some of these similar findings, these conditions would not typically cause cyclical bleeding nor would they explain the patient's prior gynecologic history.

B: Immune-related hypophysitis

Explanation: While all these conditions can cause headache, the patient's symptoms in the context of receiving immunotherapy suggest immune-related hypophysitis, an inflammation of the pituitary gland that can occur as an immune-related adverse event of therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab. Despite laboratory abnormalities not clearly indicative of hypophysitis, the presence of headaches, low energy, and difficulty reading are common symptoms and can appear before the hormonal changes occur. Furthermore, the progressive decrease of TSH in consecutive measurements may indicate pituitary involvement. Brain metastasis and pituitary adenoma would likely cause more focal, rather than variable, symptoms. A mucocele (a mucus-filled cyst) would not explain the constitutional symptoms. Hence, immune-related hypophysitis is the most probable diagnosis. Further diagnostic tests like endocrinological evaluation and imaging of the pituitary gland can confirm this diagnosis.

D: Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement. 

Explanation: The patient’s skin coloration is consistent with carotenemia, which is a clinically benign condition characterized by yellow-orange pigmentation of the skin and elevated blood carotene levels. Carotenemia is most commonly seen in infants fed high amounts of pureed vegetables and in adults consuming high amounts of specific nutritional supplements, like beta carotene. Since the condition is harmless, it does not require treatment other than decreasing the intake of carotene. Finally, skin color changes from carotenemia are usually most notable in areas of increased sweating or thickness, such as palms and soles, and unlike jaundice, it does not cause scleral discoloration.

B: Initiate bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy.

Explanation: 
This patient’s anuric renal failure with markedly elevated serum creatinine level, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria suggests severe kidney injury. The presence of elevated serum κ FLC level, along with a small monoclonal IgG κ band on serum protein electrophoresis, suggests monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). This patient’s hyperkalemia and severe azotemia are indications for starting emergent hemodialysis to prevent fatal arrhythmia and other complications of severe kidney injury. However, hemodialysis is not solely sufficient because it poorly removes κ FLCs because of their relatively high molecular weight. Plasmapheresis has been used in the past for removing FLCs; however, its efficacy has been inconsistent and the procedure is not without risk. Therefore, plasmapheresis is not recommended as first-line therapy. Furthermore, this patient’s renal ultrasound findings do not suggest a postrenal cause for his anuria, making continued aggressive hydration and diuresis unwarranted and potentially harmful. Moreover, his bone marrow biopsy finding of a normocellular bone marrow with only 10% κ-restricted plasma cells is insufficient for a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Although a renal biopsy could confirm cast nephropathy and provide valuable prognostic information, it would not influence the immediate management of this patient because treatment for kidney disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia should be initiated promptly to minimize the deposition of monoclonal κ FLCs and therefore tissue injury. Consequently, initiation of chemotherapy, such as with a bortezomib-dexamethasone–based regimen, should be started as soon as possible to decrease κ FLC production. Treatment response should be monitored by measuring serum FLC levels and trends and improvements in kidney function.

C: Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline

Explanation: The patient's recent travel to Sierra Leone, lack of malaria prophylaxis, and the presence of parasitemia on blood smear suggests he has acquired Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This subtype of malaria is resistant to chloroquine (Choice B), and artemether-lumefantrine (Choice A) is not the preferred regimen for severe malaria. Quinidine gluconate is the primary intravenous treatment for severe malaria in the United States. Doxycycline is added for its slow-acting blood schizonticidal activity. An exchange transfusion (Choice D) is not standard therapy for severe malaria and is typically reserved for patients with a high level of parasitemia (>10%). The patient's other findings, including jaundice, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status, indicate severe malaria, further supporting an aggressive treatment approach with intravenous quinidine and doxycycline.

B: Knee-located erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component.

Explanation: Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare type of chronic cutaneous vasculitis characterized by red, purple, or brown papules, nodules, and plaques. It is usually located symmetrically on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, which matches the description of the patient's presentation. The late stages of this condition may exhibit cutaneous nodules, such as those seen on the patient's calcanea.

A: Kaposi varicelliform eruption

Explanation: The presentation of the pregnant woman includes features such as an acute, painful eruption on her face and neck, confluent erythema with papulovesicles, honey-colored crusts on the left ear and preauricular area and the presence of occasional red, crusted papules on the chest, and inframammary area. This is a classic presentation of Kaposi varicelliform eruption, particularly as the patient has a history of Darier disease. The Kaposi varicelliform eruption is characterized by these painful vesicopustular eruptions and it can occur in patients with pre-existing skin conditions like Darier's disease. Histopathological findings like the full-thickness epidermal necrosis, suprabasal acantholysis, corp ronds, corp grains, parakeratosis, multinucleated cells with nuclear molding and margination also support the diagnosis.

D: Leprosy

Explanation: The gradual hair loss, loss of skin creases, the absence of pain and temperature sensation, and the presence of multiple asymptomatic skin nodules point towards a diagnosis of leprosy. Rheumatoid factor can be elevated in leprosy because of the stimulation of the immune system by Mycobacterium leprae. Skin biopsy further supports diagnosis, showing diffusion of foamy histiocytes, which can be seen in leprosy, and acid-fast bacilli - a direct indicator of Mycobacterium leprae. Additionally, the non-responsiveness to prior arthritis treatment and presence of uveitis can also be features of leprosy, thus eliminating the rest of the options.

A: Trauma-focused psychotherapy

Explanation: Trauma-focused psychotherapy, particularly cognitive processing therapy or prolonged exposure therapy, is the first-line treatment for PTSD. It directly addresses the trauma experience and its meaning to the patient's life, helps the patient work through their feelings of guilt and responsibility, and ultimately aims to reduce the severity of the PTSD symptoms. This treatment modality is also effective in treating comorbid depression and may reduce alcohol use. While pharmacotherapy could be considered as an adjunctive treatment, it is not the first-line option.

C: Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease)

Explanation: The diagnosis that fits best would be C, Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison's disease). The clinical features presented by the patient suggest a state of adrenal insufficiency. Major signs include significant weight loss, postural lightheadedness, extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, intense salt cravings, and loss of hair in certain body areas. Another hint toward Addison's disease in this case is the hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue - this is due to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary gland, responsible for stimulating melanocytes, leading to hyperpigmentation. Further, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, as seen in the patient, is also a characteristic of Addison's disease. Anorexia nervosa is less likely because it typically does not cause, or is accompanied by, hyperpigmentation, and in contrast to Addison's disease, patients with anorexia nervosa usually exhibit bradycardia rather than postural hypotension. Hypervitaminosis A and Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome do not fit the clinical picture as well.

Based on the provided information, the most appropriate response would be (C: Pulmonary valve replacement for severe pulmonary regurgitation).

Explanation: The patient's history of corrected Tetralogy of Fallot, physical examination findings, together with echocardiogram and electrocardiogram results suggest progressively severe pulmonary regurgitation. This is a common complication after initial TOF repair and it can lead to right ventricle dilation and dysfunction, atrial arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Pulmonary valve replacement is indicated in this scenario to prevent these complications. The other answer choices (A, B, and D) are not appropriate because there's no evidence of severe pulmonary hypertension, severe pulmonic valvular stenosis or a residual ventricular septal defect.

B: Malignant carotid body tumor

Explanation: Given the patient's history and the findings from the CT and MRI - specifically, the location of the neck mass and its complete encirclement of the carotid arteries, a diagnosis of a malignant carotid body tumor, also known as a carotid body paraganglioma, is plausible. Although this patient's tumor was suspected to be benign during surgical resection, the right-sided mass' sizeable nature and deeply infiltrative characteristics seen on imaging hint towards malignant potential. Furthermore, lymph node spread or distant metastases can confirm malignancy, as seen in this case with the presence of scattered lymph nodes. Carcinoids, medullary thyroid lesions, and hemangiopericytomas all present less commonly in the carotid body region and thus are less likely causes of this patient's symptomatology.
B
951
C: Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma. 

Explanation: The histologic findings of cartilage mixed with chondromyxoid stroma containing spindle cells point to a diagnosis of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma. This is a rare, benign hamartoma that typically presents in infancy or early childhood with symptoms of respiratory distress and nasal obstruction, as seen in this patient. The CT and MRI findings further support the diagnosis, showing a mass without intracranial extension, which is more consistent with nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma than with the other potential diagnoses.
C
952
D: Chordoma

Explanation: The patient's histopathologic findings along with the immunohistochemical analysis results of brachyury positivity suggest the diagnosis of a chordoma. Chordomas are rare malignant bone tumors that originate from remnants of the notochord, which is normally replaced by the vertebral bodies during development. They are characterized by the presence of physaliphorous cells and demonstrate strong immunoreactivity for brachyury, a transcription factor that is essential for notochord development. These tumors commonly occur at the base of the skull and sacrococcygeal region, but spinal chordomas, like in this case, can also occur. The other options (Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, Chordoid meningioma, Chondrosarcoma) are not consistent with the given presentation and pathological findings.
D
953
C: Desmoid tumor

Explanation: The clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings are most consistent with a desmoid tumor (fibromatosis). Desmoid tumors show a range of MRI signal characteristics depending on their collagen content, with more collagenous lesions appearing hypointense on T2-weighted imaging. In this case, β-catenin staining was positive, which is characteristic of desmoid tumors. CD34, desmin, and smooth muscle actin were negative, arguing against other spindle cell neoplasms. The lack of systemic involvement in this case is further consistent with the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor. Although less common in children compared with adults and rare in the jaw, the mandible is the most common site of occurrence in the head and neck. Ewing sarcoma, lymphoma, and eosinophilic granuloma were considered in the differential diagnosis, but the lack of system involvement, pathologic features, and genetic testing results could help to rule out these possibilities.
C
954
B: Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats

Explanation: Given the strong family history and the clinical presentation, it is likely this is a case of Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). This autosomal dominant disorder is a form of late-onset muscular dystrophy that primarily affects the muscles of the upper eyelids and pharynx. It is associated with a progressive bilateral ptosis, which is very similar to what is described here. This progressive bilateral ptosis does not fluctuate throughout the day. In addition, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which could account for the patient’s reported ‘trouble swallowing’, is also common in OPMD. Therefore, genetic testing might be warranted to confirm the diagnosis. While A: Ptosis repair by Müllerectomy or levator advancement could address the symptom of ptosis, but it is important to first identify the root cause. Genetic testing will also help advise other family members or identify the disease in its early stages. C: Treatment with prednisone and D: Observation would not be appropriate-either immediately or necessarily-because OPMD is not an inflammatory disease and only observing the patient will not contribute to the patient’s diagnosis or treatment plan.

C: Start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper 

Explanation: The fundus examination revealing multiple shallow serous retinal detachments, optic nerve hyperemia, as well as optic disc leakage and fluorescein pooling in the areas of detachment pointed towards Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. VKH is an autoimmune disease that targets melanocytic antigens and is associated with panuveitis, neurologic, and cutaneous manifestations. First-line therapy for VKH involves aggressive, high-dose systemic corticosteroids, with slow taper, as sudden withdrawal can lead to a recurrence of the disease. Therefore, starting prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper is the most appropriate next step in management. Other options such as surgical decompression or B-scan ultrasonography are typically not first-line choices. Checking the blood pressure could potentially be useful in other cases but not directly related to treating VKH disease.

C

Explanation: The presence of bilateral retinal hemorrhages in a young man without any history of eye problems or risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension is suspicious. Combined with his systemic symptoms of easy bruising and progressive fatigue, it suggests a hematologic disease. A complete blood cell count would be the most appropriate initial test to begin to evaluate for a potential hematological issue that may be causing these symptoms.
B: Biopsy

Explanation: The ocular examination revealed white vitreous deposits, inferior retinal detachment, and subretinal material in the left eye. This finding, along with the history of breast cancer and brain metastasis, raises concerns about possible ocular metastasis. Therefore, obtaining a biopsy will help to clarify the diagnosis by providing tissue for histopathology evaluation. This approach will guide further management and treatment decisions.

B: Acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. The ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan results also show the presence of gallstones and hypodense area mainly in the right lobe of the liver which could be due to pericholecystic fluid from gallbladder perforation into the liver. An intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder is a rare complication of acute cholecystitis and usually occurs when inflammation and infection of the gallbladder lead to necrosis and rupture into the liver. This diagnosis is further supported by the visualization of the gallbladder fundus just below the hypodense area. The clinical and imaging profile of this case doesn't strongly support the alternative diagnoses of liver abscess, gallbladder cancer, or necrotic liver tumor.

959
A: Mucocele of the appendix 

Explanation: Given the patient's age, the progressive nature of the cystic lesion, and its location in close proximity to the cecum, a Mucocele of the appendix is a strong diagnostic possibility. Mucoceles are mucin-filled dilations of the appendix that can cause progressive enlargement and tend to be asymptomatic until they rupture or cause obstruction symptoms. Although the other responses (Cecal diverticulum, Meckel diverticulum, Ileal duplication cyst) could potentially cause a cystic lesion in this area, they are less likely due to the patient's presentation and the lesion's characteristics. Additionally, the contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of her abdomen showing a cystic lesion in the right iliac fossa also supports this diagnosis.

A: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasia of the pancreas

Explanation: The findings from the aspirate and endoscopic ultrasonography suggested no signs of mucinous material or tumor cells, which could have indicated a mucinous cystic neoplasia. In addition, the normal carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 levels, indicators of pancreatic cancer, do not suggest a malignant etiology. With the aforementioned disregarded, the diagnosis of a solid pseudopapillary neoplasia of the pancreas is most plausible. These are rare pancreatic tumors, often seen in young women, that tend to be large and encapsulated with a mixed solid and cystic appearance, as observed in this patient. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) most commonly occur in the stomach and small intestine and are less likely to be located in the pancreas. Finally, a pancreatic pseudocyst would typically present following pancreatitis, which the patient did not have.

A: Perform local incision and debridement 

Explanation: The condition described appears to be herpetic whitlow, a viral infection of the finger caused by the herpes simplex virus. It typically causes painful vesicular eruptions on the skin. Management of this condition may include incision and drainage, especially in the case of severe or extensive infections. The herpes simplex virus is sensitive to antiviral medications like valacyclovir, but the antibiotic clindamycin is not appropriate as this is a viral, not bacterial infection. However, invasive procedures like incision and debridement or aspirating the vesicles can lead to bacterial superinfection and autoinoculation and should be avoided. Hence, the treatment of choice for herpetic whitlow is oral antiviral medications such as valacyclovir, so it would seem instructing the patient to take only the valacyclovir (option C) might make more sense but without an antiviral sensitivity result, it hard to definitively state this. Nevertheless, if an immediate action needs to be taken before the lab result, incision and debridement (option A) may be appropriate especially if the infection appears to be progressing rapidly. Hospital admittance is only typically required in severe or complicated cases.

962
D: Start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a prominent P2, dilated right atrium and ventricle, and findings of a high pulmonary arterial pressure with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, the discovery of a nonocclusive thrombus in his femoral and popliteal veins alongside the V/Q scan and pulmonary angiography likely point to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This is a form of pulmonary hypertension caused by old, organized clots obstructing the pulmonary vessels, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Given this analysis, the optimal management for the patient would be to start anticoagulation to prevent further thromboembolic events and to refer the patient for possible pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. This surgical procedure is the treatment of choice for CTEPH and has been shown to significantly improve prognosis by removing the obstructive material, leading to an improvement in symptoms and pulmonary hemodynamics.

963
B: Pseudoporphyria

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and relevant medical history supports a diagnosis of pseudoporphyria. Pseudoporphyria is a bullous photodermatosis often associated with medications such as voriconazole, often used for fungal infection post allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It characteristically presents with flaccid bullae and erosions on sun-exposed skin, and is typically triggered by sun exposure, as in this case. The condition mimics porphyria cutanea tarda, but lacks the biochemical abnormalities of porphyria and the other options are less likely given the clinical scenario. Acquired epidermolysis bullosa doesn't match the condition due to a lack of mucosal involvement. Graft-vs-host disease is unlikely due to a lack of worsening after sun exposure, while photoallergic drug reaction usually presents with an eczematous eruption rather than bullae.
B

964
C: Mycosis fungoides 

Explanation: Given the patient's history, clinical examination, and histology, the diagnosis is most likely mycosis fungoides. This is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that often presents as red, scaly patches or plaques on the skin. The condition is chronic and can persist for many years. Given that our patient has a longstanding history of erythematous papules and plaques, this would support the diagnosis. The skin biopsy findings with haloed lymphocytes infiltrating the epidermis (epidermotropism), resembling Pautrier microabscesses, and forming a bandlike distribution in the superficial dermis are typical for mycosis fungoides. Additionally, the lack of response to topical corticosteroids as well as the diffuse nature of the disease further supports this diagnosis. It should be confirmed with additional testing, including T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies.

A: Botryomycosis

Explanation: Botryomycosis is a rare, chronic, suppurative bacterial infection that affects the skin and occasionally the viscera. It begins as a small papule or nodule that enlarges slowly and becomes a firm mass that discharges creamy or yellow-colored pus. This type of infection is often identified in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV, consistent with this patient's medical history. Additionally, the presence of eosinophilic material surrounding small cocci in the biopsy, along with the absence of purulent drainage, fever, chills, or any other systemic symptoms, also supports the diagnosis of Botryomycosis. Furthermore, the patient's ongoing treatment for HIV and latent tuberculosis would help to manage any possible secondary infections.

A: Pompe disease

Explanation: Pompe disease is a rare, inherited and often fatal disorder that disables the heart and muscles. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness that can make it hard to breathe and eventually results in respiratory failure. The given case aligns with Pompe disease as the patient has had muscle weakness since infancy, waddling gait, hyperlordosis, and delayed walking. The significant improvement of the patient's neuromuscular condition during asthma attack (when given albuterol and inhaled steroids) could be linked to the therapeutic benefits of these medications since they are known to help increase the strength and endurance of muscles weakened by Pompe disease. Meanwhile, the other diseases have distinguishing features that were not notable in the patient's clinical history or presentation.
C

967
C: Hypothyroidism

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and presentation strongly suggest hypothyroidism. She has a family history of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can cause growth and pubertal delay, which may explain her short stature and early Tanner stage, despite being 13 years old. The presence of acanthosis nigricans indicates insulin resistance, which is common in individuals with hypothyroidism. The nonpitting edema (myxedema) in her hands is characteristic in hypothyroidism. Additionally, hypothyroidism has been associated with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), the hip issue observed in this patient. The other options, while theoretically possible, are less likely given the overall clinical picture. For example, her presentation does not match common symptoms of diabetes mellitus like polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss. Similarly, hyponatremia and fatty liver disease typically do not result in the features observed in this patient.

A: Echocardiography in 2 weeks to confirm Takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Explanation: The patient’s presentation is suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy), a condition known for mimicking symptoms of a heart attack but often occurring in response to severe stress. It is characterized by a temporary disruption of the heart's normal pumping function, while the remainder of the heart functions normally or with even more forceful contractions. This condition is often preceded by severe emotional distress, such as the unexpected death of a loved one. Symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack, including chest pain and shortness of breath. The ECG changes, apical akinesis, and elevation of troponin levels together are suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Choosing A to perform an echocardiography after two weeks allows for the observation of heart function over time, providing confirmation of the condition, as recovery generally occurs within weeks.

969
C: Lymphangiomatous polyp

Explanation: The histologic sections revealed a fibrovascular core with stratified squamous epithelium and a subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue, which are features characteristic of a lymphangiomatous polyp. The identification of lymphatic channels with D2-40 antibody further strengthens this diagnosis. This benign lesion is thought to be a malformation rather than a true neoplasm and has been associated with viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, similar to the patient's history. The absence of cellular atypia also supports a benign diagnosis. Therefore, lymphangiomatous polyp (choice C) is the most appropriate diagnosis in this case.
C
970
D: Solitary cutaneous myxoma

Explanation: Solitary cutaneous myxoma, also known as superficial angiomyxoma, is characterized by a slow-growing, painless, flesh-colored to pink mass. It can appear anywhere on the body but most commonly on the head, neck, and lower extremities. Histologically, it is hypocellular and consists of stellate to spindle-shaped cells scattered in a myxoid matrix, which fits the description given. Other features in favor of this diagnosis include the presence of collapsed blood vessels and the absence of mitotic activity. The smooth, dome-shaped appearance, glistening surface, and gelatinous consistency observed during surgery are also typical. The absence of a keratin plug, hair, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands rules out epidermoid and dermoid cysts. Also, no cartilaginous or osseous tissue was present, which makes chondroma an unlikely diagnosis.
D
971
A: Parathyroid carcinoma

Explanation: The patient is presented with hypercalcemia and significantly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Given these clinical features and the identification of a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, a diagnosis of Parathyroid carcinoma is the most likely. This condition is a rare endocrine malignancy that can lead to severe hypercalcemia and high PTH levels. Lytic bone lesions can be linked to the high levels of PTH, leading to bone resorption and hypercalcemia. Multiple myeloma often presents with multiple lytic bone lesions, but the significantly elevated PTH levels are not typically a feature. Primary bone tumors do not typically cause isolated hypercalcemia, and Osteitis fibrosa cystica, while associated with hyperparathyroidism, doesn't usually present with a singular parathyroid lesion. Hence, the diagnosis of Parathyroid carcinoma is the most reasonable in this case.

D
972
C: Multifocal granular cell tumor

Explanation: The histopathologic findings demonstrate a monotonous population of cells with round nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm. These findings, along with positive staining for S-100 and CD68, are highly characteristic of granular cell tumor. Additionally, granular cell tumors can present as multiple lesions in multiple locations, as found in this case. On the contrary, sarcoidosis is characterized by non-caseating granulomas which doesn't match the pathology reported here. Respiratory papillomatosis would typically present with papilloma-like lesions and a HPV-positive status, and metastatic neuroblastoma, a malignant condition, normally originates in the adrenal glands and does not align with this child’s presentation or the histopathology reported.
C
973
C: Esophageal bronchus

Explanation: The CT imaging is consistent with an Esophageal bronchus situation. This is a rare congenital abnormality in which a bronchus arises from the esophagus. Typical symptoms include recurrent pneumonia and swallowing issues as in the case of the infant. The diagnosis can be confirmed through bronchoscopy and CT imaging. The patient's history of choking and desaturation with oral feeding, and the resulting aspiration align with such a diagnosis.
C
974
D: Repeat biopsy of orbital apex and sinuses.

Explanation: This patient's apparent nonresponsiveness to antibacterial and anti-inflammatory treatments, coupled with progressive neurological damage and persistent pain, raises questions about her initial diagnosis. In such circumstances, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis via biopsy, preventing management based on possible inaccurate histopathological information. This will help to guide appropriate therapy and prevent further irreversible damage, such as vision loss. Thickening and enhancement around the optic nerve may be due to granulomas or neoplasm, which cannot be ruled out solely by imaging. Further, recurrent infections or other microorganisms not covered by the initial antibacterial treatment may be present.

A: Continue to observe. 

Explanation: In this case, it would be most prudent to continue observation over an immediate return to the operating room. The risks associated with further surgical intervention may outweigh the potential benefits, primarily considering the chance for exacerbating the detachment or inducing a hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic Descemet membrane detachments can spontaneously resolve over time and monitoring the eye would provide the necessary information to decide the next best step for patient management.

976
C: Instill atropine and IOP-lowering drops and place the patient in a supine position

Explanation: This patient's presentation is suggestive of acute pupillary block secondary to lens dislocation. This can happen in Marfan syndrome as a result of the zonular weakness that can lead to lens dislocation. The antero-superiorly dislocated crystalline lens is obstructing aqueous flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber, leading to a dramatic rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) that is causing this patient's symptoms. Placing the patient in the supine position may allow the lens to fall posteriorly, therefore increasing the space between the iris and the lens and restoring aqueous flow. Atropine and IOP-lowering drops may also aid in reducing the IOP and controlling pupillary block. Meanwhile, surgical intervention can be considered once the IOP has been controlled and the patient's condition has been stabilized. This is important because sudden removal of a lens in this state might lead to worsening of condition including potential retinal detachment and need for more aggressive surgical intervention.

977
A

Explanation: The sudden decrease in vision suggests a vascular event. Hence, a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing is a reasonable initial step. Conditions such as blood dyscrasia, clotting factor abnormality or high platelet count could possibly contribute to a bleeding diathesis. Systemic or ocular conditions can often be associated with retinal hemorrhages hence a thorough evaluation is required. Although corticosteroids are used for inflammatory conditions, there is no evidence of inflammation from the case description. Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome might be considered if associated systemic symptoms or laboratory evidence suggests this diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography could possibly provide additional information, however, the patient's young age and presentation without a history of systemic vascular disease makes this less likely. Therefore, option A would be the most appropriate immediate next step.
Without the necessary medical expertise and the ability to perform an in-depth examination, including appropriate diagnostic tests, it wouldn't be accurate or ethical to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the information provided such as the presence of intraluminal hypodense mass in the small bowel, the symptoms potentially point to a form of obstruction-causing growth. The four diagnostic possibilities provided all represent forms of tumors that could potentially cause such symptoms. Determining the correct answer would require additional information and diagnostic testing. It's highly recommended to consult a trained healthcare provider to get a clinical diagnosis.
B: Retrocecal acute appendicitis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms align with those commonly associated with acute appendicitis: sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen, nausea, and abdominal tenderness. The elevated white blood cell count is indicative of an infection or inflammation, which is a typical finding in appendicitis. Ultrasound often shows an inflamed appendix or abscess in cases of retrocecal acute appendicitis. The hypoechoic area with a diameter of 33 mm and blurred margins could indicate an inflamed appendix or an appendiceal abscess, while the thickening of the cecal wall could correlate to an inflamed cecum often found in cases of retrocecal appendicitis.

B: Meningioma

Explanation: The history of a rapidly expanding scalp mass, the radiological demonstration of a large homogeneously enhancing extra-and intracranial mass with bone involvement, and dural thickening are characteristics of meningioma. Meningiomas can occasionally invade the overlying bone and extend extracranially, a process called hyperostosis. Furthermore, these types of tumors are more common in elderly female patients, which fits the profile of the patient in this scenario. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and meningeal sarcoma would not generally present with these specific symptoms and radiological findings.

B

Explanation: 
The clustered, vesicular rash on an erythematous base on a single dermatome is suggestive of herpes zoster, which is a reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV). The patient's age and medical conditions could have led to a decreased immune response, triggering the VZV reactivation. Antiviral therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to decrease the duration of the viral shedding, hasten rash healing, and reduce the severity and duration of acute pain. Oral valacyclovir is a commonly used antiviral in the treatment of herpes zoster. Other options included blood cultures (not indicated in the absence of systemic symptoms), an oral antihistamine (which might help with symptoms but would not treat the underlying disease), and a topical corticosteroid cream (which is not typically used for herpes zoster and could potentially worsen the rash).
A: Avoid further ibuprofen use and prescribe a topical steroid 

Explanation: The clinical feature and histopathological findings in the case are consistent with acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a rare severe cutaneous adverse reaction primarily triggered by medications, most commonly antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although the patient's only recent medication use was ibuprofen, AGEP also may be associated with viral infections or an idiopathic cause. Therefore, this makes "A" the best next step to avoid ibuprofen usage and manage the symptoms with topical steroids to reduce the inflammation and allow the skin to heal. Other options like infliximab therapy (usually used for chronic cases like psoriasis) or cephalexin treatment (in cases of bacterial infection which is not confirmed by cultures in this case) would not be the initial step. Testing for HIV is usually performed if there are specific risk factors or clinical manifestations which are not present in this case.

B: Obtain a brain biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, paired with the CT and MRI results showing a mass lesion, point toward a primary brain lesion rather than a neurological manifestation of his HIV infection. Given the patient's young age, rapid onset of symptoms, and significant mass effect on imaging, primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) should be strongly considered. The most definitive test for diagnosing PCNSL is a brain biopsy. Serologic testing for toxoplasma was negative, which makes CNS toxoplasmosis unlikely despite it being a common cause of brain lesions in patients with HIV. While antiretroviral therapy could benefit his HIV condition, managing the brain lesion is the immediate priority. A lumbar puncture may contribute to the evaluation of other conditions but is not first-line in this scenario due to the presence of a mass lesion. So, a brain biopsy (Option B), is the most appropriate step to take next.

B: Methimazole-induced vasculitis

Explanation: The patient's presentation of painful ulcers, swelling, feverish symptoms along with her consistent use of methimazole prescribes a scenario of methimazole-induced vasculitis. It is a rare but significant side effect of anti-thyroid drugs like Methimazole which is used in treating Graves' disease. A research study elucidates that it typically appears after several months of Methimazole therapy with symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, skin lesions, and other organ-specific symptoms. Although biopsy of the skin lesion did not confirm vasculitis, the temporal correlation with methimazole use and the skin manifestations make methimazole-induced vasculitis a plausible diagnosis. The disease mostly resolves after discontinuation of the causative drug. The vasculitis is characterized by the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and could be diagnosed by a blood test detecting ANCA. This diagnosis would explain the persistent ulceration and swelling despite the antibiotic therapy she received for the presumed Staphylococcal infection.

C: Colloid milium. 

Explanation: 
Colloid milium is a rare, degenerative skin condition characterized by the appearance of small, flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules around the eyes, cheeks, back of hands, and dorsal aspects of the feet. The papules are caused by the accumulation of a substance called colloid in the skin. The condition is mostly seen in middle-aged or elderly individuals and is usually associated with chronic sun exposure. In this case, the patient's presentation of skin-colored, waxy smooth papules on the dorsum of the nose and hands supports the diagnosis of colloid milium. Chronic sun exposure is also aligned with the patient's self-reported photosensitivity in childhood.

986
B: Disseminated zoster 

Explanation: The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and usage of cyclosporine likely resulted in an immunocompromised state. This susceptibility, along with the distribution of lesions and the patient's preceding history of fever, chills, and a cough, would be suggestive of a viral infection rather than other conditions listed. While features of erythema multiforme or atypical hand-foot-mouth could potentially explain the appearance of the rash, the spread of the lesions to areas beyond the hands and feet and lack of mucosal involvement make these less likely. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually presents with palpable purpura, which the patient lacks. Ultimately, Disseminated zoster - a spread of a varicella zoster virus infection (usually seen in immunocompromised individuals) seems to best fit the clinical picture given.

D: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

Explanation: The progressive nature of this patient's neurological decline, along with the rapidly worsening ataxia, cognitive impairment, the presence of seizures, and the eventual development of akinetic mutism (no speech or limb movements), suggests a rapidly progressive dementia. Among these choices, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most typical cause of a rapidly progressive dementia. CJD may present with rapidly progressive cognitive impairment, personality changes, ataxia, and myoclonus. An EEG often shows diffuse slowing, which fits with this patient's EEG results. Furthermore, the finding of normal MRI imaging does not exclude the diagnosis, as imaging in CJD can be normal early in the illness course. The other conditions listed - paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia, adult-onset cerebellar ataxia syndrome, and Wernicke encephalopathy do not typically present with such rapid cognitive decline.

D: Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids.

Explanation: This case of progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms, abulia, executive dysfunction, mild cognitive impairment, and MRI findings of scattered T2 hyperintensities in the white matter and cerebral atrophy is highly suggestive of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS). The genetic disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which is supported by the case history about the patient's mother.

HDLS is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by personality changes, depression, cognitive decline, motor impairment, and white matter changes in the brain. The MRI findings in HDLS typically show white matter hyperintensities on T2 sequences mainly affecting the frontal lobes.

HDLS could clearly explain the patient's signs and symptoms, as well as her mother's history. A definitive diagnosis can be made with genetic testing for the CSF1R gene mutation, the primary cause of HDLS. In contrast, other choices are less likely due to various factors such as symptomatology, pattern of inheritance, demographic details, and/or the specific neuroimaging findings.

B: Pediculosis corporis

Explanation: 
Pediculosis corporis, also known as body lice infestation, manifests with pruritic, maculopapular rash, often on the trunk. The rash will usually be most severe around the waist and groin because that's where the lice are often found on clothing seams. The blue-gray macules seen on the boy's trunk are known as "vagabond's disease" and indicate chronic infestation. It may occur in individuals who live in crowded conditions, do not have regular access to bathing and laundry facilities, or are otherwise socially disadvantaged. Given the family history details supplied, this seems the most likely diagnosis. However, diagnosis would be confirmed by finding adult lice or eggs in the seams of the patient's clothing or on the body. The nonblanching nature of these macules and the presentation in the given history in the question suggest body lice over drug rash, leukemia cutis, or varicella-zoster virus infection.

B: Obtain cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. 

Explanation: This patient's exercise-induced syncope accompanied by exercise-induced atrioventricular (AV) block and right bundle branch block is suggestive of conduction system disease and suspicion for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which holds a primary indication. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best next step in evaluation. ARVC can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, particularly during exercise. The right bundle branch block pattern in this patient could reflect disease of the right ventricular outflow tract, a frequent site of involvement in ARVC. Cardiac MRI can evaluate for right ventricular enlargement and wall motion abnormalities characteristic of ARVC and is the diagnostic test of choice to assess for structural heart disease when echocardiogram is unrevealing. In a patient with likely conduction system disease, a pacemaker implantation might be necessary but only after a careful search for reversible causes and primary disease etiologies. Implantable loop recorder may be useful when syncope is suspected to be due to an arrhythmic etiology, and noninvasive testing has not established a diagnosis. Tilt-table testing is helpful for confirmatory diagnosis of vasovagal (neurally mediated) syncope, not suggested by this patient's presentation.

A: Langerhans cell histiocytosis 

Explanation: The presence of numerous symptoms such as limping, bony changes in the long bones, a varus deformity of the lower extremities suggest a pathological process involving the skeletal system. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) presents with such symptoms and its characteristic feature is the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which can lead to changes in the bone structure. Since other symptoms like nasal congestion, mucopurulent discharge, and conductive hearing loss suggest an involvement of the ENT region, which is also common in LCH, this diagnosis seems plausible. Additionally, the presence of multiple macules on several body parts and the low TSH level also fit into the overall clinical picture of LCH. Although other diseases mentioned in the options may present similar symptoms, the combination and manifestation of all of these symptoms fits the description of Langerhans cell histiocytosis most.

D: Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma.

Explanation: The characteristics of the nasal mass, such as the presence of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures, are consistent with the diagnosis of Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma. This condition is an uncommon benign hamartoma usually presenting as a congenital midline nasal mass, as in this case. Histologically, it is characterized by a disordered admixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures, corroborating the features seen on the histopathological images of the nasal mass from this patient. This differs from the other choices like glioma, neuromuscular hamartoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma which would present with a different set of histological features.
D
993
B: Laryngeal gout. 

Explanation: In this case, the patient's history of gout, the chalky white appearance of the lesion, and the presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals all point to laryngeal gout. Gout is a condition characterized by high uric acid levels leading to the formation of urate crystals, which can deposit in various tissues, including the vocal cords. Here, the deposits have likely caused hoarseness by impacting the normal vibration of the vocal folds. The patient's history of smoking and Agent Orange exposure would make squamous cell carcinoma a consideration, but the histopathologic review showing amorphous eosinophilic material and the negative result for Congo red, used to identify amyloid proteins, argues against this diagnosis and also amyloidosis. Rheumatoid nodules could reasonably cause vocal cord lesions, but typically they would not produce the chalky white appearance or birefringent crystals indicative of urate deposits.
B
994
B: Dermoid cyst

Explanation: A Dermoid cyst is a type of benign growth, or teratoma, that may contain different varieties of body tissue including skin, hair, and glands. Dermoid cysts are thought to originate from skin trapped at the time of embryonic closure. The characteristic histological feature is the presence of keratinizing squamous epithelium which is the mentioned feature in the case. Other possible contents of a dermoid cyst (although not mentioned here) may include adipose tissue, hair, and fragments of bone, teeth, or nerve tissue. In this case, the location of presentation (floor of mouth), the growth pattern, and the histological findings support the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. Foregut duplication cyst and Thyroglossal duct cyst would present somewhere along the midline neck and not the floor of mouth. A sublingual abscess would typically be associated with notable pain and systemic signs of infection, neither of which are noted here. Therefore, given the details of this case, a Dermoid cyst is the most likely diagnosis.
B
995
B: Observation with normal follow-up 

Explanation: Given the patient's asymptomatic status, normal visual acuity, and consistent appearance of the lesion over several years, immediate intervention is not required. The lesion is stable in size and not causing any vision abnormalities. Although surgical excision could assist with definitive diagnosis, it also carries risks especially considering the close proximity to the fovea. Genetic testing is not immediately indicated as the patient's history and presentation do not suggest a genetic disorder. Total-body staging workup would be more appropriate if the lesion was suspected to be malignant or if there were any systemic symptoms but the asymptomatic status of the patient and absence of any abnormal findings in the right eye make this option less likely. Regular follow-ups with meticulous monitoring of the patient’s ocular condition are therefore most appropriate to detect any changes as early as possible.

D: Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: In this case, due to the bilateral optic disc edema and anterior uveitis, it would be crucial to rule out a central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory process such as neurosarcoidosis. This would warrant an orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is option D. Such conditions can potentially have more systemic implications that may require a different therapeutic strategy, and an MRI would provide more information about neurological involvement. Further serum and urine testing could be explored depending on the MRI results, but the first step should be identifying any possible neurologic involvement.

C: Biopsy the eyelid. 

Explanation: Given the unresponsiveness to the previous treatments, lack of improvement in the symptoms, and the patient's history of basal cell carcinoma, a biopsy of the eyelid would be the most logical next step. This would help to either confirm or rule out the recurrence of cancer, which could be the cause of the continuing symptoms and eyelid abnormalities.

998
B. The patient's overall clinical presentation suggests that there is an inflammatory or infectious etiology at play. Given the optic nerve head edema with peripapillary flame hemorrhages, combined with intermittent blurry vision and a skin rash, differential diagnosis could be broad. It is crucial to rule out any potential systemic conditions such as autoimmune visual syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, or Lyme disease. Ordering bloodwork to check for inflammatory markers (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and specific tests (VDRL, ACE, and ANA) could help narrow down the etiology. Furthermore, MRI of the brain and orbits is needed to rule out any intracranial or intraorbital pathology that could be causing the optic nerve edema. Although lumbar puncture and molecular testing are useful in certain cases, this approach may be more useful after the result of initial less invasive investigations as suggested in option B.
B: Foreign body ingestion 

Explanation: The patient's history of appendectomy and the presence of calcification in the terminal ileum as seen on the CT scan could indicate the presence of a foreign body. Though stump appendicitis, Crohn ileitis, and Carcinoid could also cause similar symptoms, there isn't enough telling evidence in the given case to diagnose with these. Foreign body ingestion can cause a slow onset of symptoms and inflammation around the area, consistent with the man's symptoms and scan results. Leukocytosis also commonly occurs as a response to inflammation or infection, which could be caused by the foreign body.

D: Bronchogenic cyst. 

Explanation: The characteristics of the lesion, including its mobile nature, smooth surface, anechoic appearance on endoscopic ultrasonography, and lack of invasion into nearby structures, suggest that it is a cystic, not a solid, lesion. The location of the lesion in the distal esophagus and the symptomatic improvement in the upright position are consistent with a bronchogenic cyst. Though these are typically mediastinal and asymptomatic, when they occur adjacent to the esophagus, they can cause symptoms like dysphagia by compressing the esophagus. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor and esophageal carcinoma are typically solid tumors and would present as hyperechoic (not anechoic) on ultrasonography. An inclusion cyst would not typically cause the symptoms seen in this patient.
C

1001
D: Lymphoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation, imaging studies, and patient's history suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma. The progressive swelling in supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular regions, pain while chewing, and a history of sarcoidosis are indicative of lymphoma. The woman's imaging results demonstrate multiple metabolically active masses and enlarged lymph nodes in diverse regions, such as the left masticator space, right axillary, left mediastinal, and intra-abdominal areas. 

Squamous cell carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma cannot always explain the disease's systemic presentations. Although particularly squamous cell carcinoma might be associated with metastases to regional lymph nodes, it is less likely to present with such widespread metastasis. Similarly, chondrosarcoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are localised diseases and are unlikely to present with the comprehensive spread that this patient is experiencing. Thus, the most suitable diagnosis would be lymphoma.

B: Check rapid plasma reagin, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and lead level 

Explanation: This patient's signs of peripheral neuropathy with sensory and motor deficits, eyebrow and eyelash loss, scaly plaques, and lymphadenopathy are suggestive of Hansen's disease (leprosy). These symptoms could be secondary to another condition and it's important to rule out other potential causes. Rapid plasma reagin would check for syphilis, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level would check for hypothyroidism, and a lead level would check for lead poisoning, all of which can cause neuropathy and skin changes. Hence, before jumping to a treatment, conducting these tests would be a logical next step to confirm the diagnosis. Performing a biopsy would also be a good step, but as given the choice, it would be advisable to check for other diseases first.

D: Equestrian perniosis.

Explanation: Equestrian perniosis (also known as chilblains) is a type of pernio induced by cold, nonfreezing temperatures and damp conditions, a situation that could be common at a horse stable and during the winter months. The woman's condition, especially her occupation and the worsening of symptoms during colder times, points to this diagnosis. Characteristics of equestrian perniosis can include painful erythematous or violaceous plaques on the thighs, often with accompanying ulcerations, which matches the woman's presentation. Riding for many hours a day would expose the thighs to prolonged cold and damp conditions, causing the circinate plaques and focal areas of ulceration seen on physical examination. The other options do not fit as well with the overall clinical picture provided.

B: Pyoderma gangrenosum

Explanation: This patient’s clinical feature and biopsy findings are consistent with Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). PG is a neutrophilic dermatosis that can occur idiopathically or associated with systemic illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or malignancies. Lesions often begin as tender papules or pustules that may erode into painful ulcers with purulent discharge, similar to those seen in this patient. Histopathology often shows dense neutrophilic infiltration, edema, and necrosis in the dermis. Given the negative results of fungal and bacterial cultures and the patient's medical history of RA, this is indicative of a PG diagnosis. The other diagnosis options are less likely based on presentation and the pathology results.

D: Nodular amyloid

Explanation: The case refers to a "diffuse infiltrate of pale eosinophilic material with prominent clefts" upon biopsy. This is a characteristic feature of nodular amyloidosis and can be confirmed with a Congo red stain, which is mentioned in the case. Nodular amyloidosis is often associated with systemic diseases, including diabetes, which the patient has. The presentation on foot, a site of possible repetitive trauma, also fits well with nodular amyloidosis. The other options (A: Pseudolymphoma, B: Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and C: Plantar cerebriform collagenoma) are less likely given the clinical and histological presentation.

1006
C: Scurvy

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation - hemorrhagic gingivitis, arthralgias, and lower extremity ecchymoses - in combination with the laboratory evidence of anemia and the physical finding of corkscrew hairs, is suggestive of scurvy. Scurvy is caused by a deficiency in vitamin C, which is essential for the synthesis of collagen, necessary for healthy skin, blood vessels, and bone. While scurvy is rare in industrialized nations, it can still occur in individuals with poor nutrition, malabsorption syndromes, and restrictive diets - all plausible in this patient, especially considering also a diagnosis of autism, which can be associated with restricted dietary intake due to sensory issues. Resistance to passive joint movement could be due to subperiosteal hematomas, another classic sign of scurvy due to fragile blood vessels. Notably, the necrotizing gingivostomatitis may have been an initial sign of vitamin C deficiency, as vitamin C is essential for maintaining the health of the periodontal ligament.

1007
D: Fecal impaction due to opium addiction. 

Explanation: Although the patient denied substance abuse, the consistent hypogastric pain and absence of bowel movements for an extended period suggest fecal impaction. The absence of abnormal intestinal air-fluid levels and free peritoneal air in the CT findings, as well as the fact that the rectum is not empty, eliminate options A and B, as these would more likely present with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abnormal laboratory results. Option C, body packing, is generally associated with drug mule activity, and there are no indications in the case presented that suggest this as a probable cause. Therefore, despite the patient's denial, fecal impaction due to opium addiction could be a possibility, as chronic opioid use can cause slowed gut motility and subsequent issues of constipation and fecal impaction.
C

1008
D: Nodular melanoma.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a rapidly growing, bleeding mass alongside a history of frequent sun exposure aligns with a diagnosis of nodular melanoma. The positiveness for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 in biopsy further support this, as these are marker proteins associated with melanoma. Also, the fludeoxyglucose-avid lesion on the back extending into the subcutaneous fat and fludeoxyglucose-avid uptake in the left axilla observed in the scans often indicates metastases, which is consistent with malignant melanoma. The remaining options (Cavernous lymphangioma, nodular basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) do not typically present with rapid growth, bleeding, or such strong immunohistochemical results. Thus, nodular melanoma is the most likely diagnosis.

1009
B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery.

Explanation: 

The patient's condition is critical, with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the need for an intra-aortic balloon pump placement. The most immediate life-threatening concern here is the significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, which supplies blood to a large portion of the heart. Given its severity (90% to 95%), this is likely causing her heart to be starved of oxygen, leading to her symptoms and unstable heart rhythym. Hence, the potential restoration of blood flow through the immediate stenting of the left main coronary artery should be the priority.
 
While the atrial septal defect is a concern, it is not as immediately life-threatening in this scenario. Similarly, coronary artery bypass graft surgery is time-consuming and might not be suitable given her unstable condition. Pulmonic valve balloon valvotomy is not directly related to the main problems the patient is facing at the present time.

B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery 

Explanation: The patient is experiencing severe and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias due to significant left main coronary artery stenosis and subsequent ischemia. Emergent stenting can provide immediate revascularization and relief of ischemia, which is the likely trigger for ventricular arrhythmias. Also, stenting is the treatment of choice for left main coronary artery disease especially in hemodynamically unstable patients who need prompt restoration of blood flow. It has a lesser procedural time as compared to Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). Given the fact that she's hemodynamically unstable, time is of the essence. The atrial septal defect is not life-threatening in the short term and can be managed after the coronary artery stenosis is addressed. A balloon valvotomy is not indicated in this case because the primary issue is coronary ischemia not valvular heart disease.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery 

Explanation: The patient's instability resulting from recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, associated with ST-segment depressions, suggests significant ischemia likely secondary to the left main coronary artery stenosis. Immediate revascularization is needed in such cases to resolve the underlying ischemia and stabilize the patient. As such, answer B: Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery would be an appropriate action to take at this stage of the patient's presentation. Transthoracic echocardiography did reveal an atrial septal defect, but this does not account for the acute coronary syndrome, ventricular arrhythmias or her unstable condition. Therefore, while atrial septal defect closure may be needed eventually, it is not the immediate priority. Pulmonic valve balloon valvotomy and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are treatment options that would not effectively and immediately relieve the left main coronary artery stenosis causing the life-threatening ischemia. With emergent coronary stent implantation, the left main coronary artery blockage would be relieved, reducing ischemia and the likelihood of associated malignant arrhythmias.

C: Thyroid cartilage fracture

Explanation: The sudden pressure change caused by the sneeze could result in fracture of the laryngeal structures, particularly in the presence of a sharp turning or bending head motion. Such a fracture would induce vocal changes, pain, and hematoma formation as observed in this case. The patient's lack of history regarding trauma, surgery, or intubation, further supports this diagnosis, as these could otherwise explain the symptoms and laryngoscopic findings. Also, no palpable crepitus was present to suggest a laryngocele, and vocal fold hemangioma would likely have presented with prior symptoms or been visible upon laryngoscopy. A traumatic intubation is not consistent with the patient's history.
C
1011
B: Persistent stapedial artery

Explanation: The incidental finding in the intraoperative photograph suggested a persistent stapedial artery, which is a rare embryologic anomaly that continues to persist after birth. It is usually asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally during radiographic imaging or surgery. The abnormal artery can lead to a pulsatile tinnitus that can be heard by both the patient and the examiner, as was found in this case. The condition is also associated with vertigo, as reported by this patient. The unusual clicking sound described by the patient is likely due to turbulent blood flow through the persistent stapedial artery. The other possibilities (Paraganglioma, Cholesteatoma, Dehiscent carotid canal) can present with similar symptoms but the radiographic and intraoperative findings are more consistent with a persistent stapedial artery.
B
1012
B: Carcinoid Tumor. 

Explanation: The presentation of a smooth hypervascular mass arising from the posterior membranous trachea in an elderly patient, with no major respiratory symptoms, is indicative of a carcinoid tumor. Carcinoid tumors are rare, well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms that can occur in the trachea and have a predilection for the posterior membranous wall. Despite being malignant, they often grow slowly and may not cause symptoms until they are large or have spread, which seems to be the case in this presentation. The other options, while also tumors, do not fit the presentation as well. Superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma and paraganglioma tend to present with hoarseness and dysphagia, which are not seen in this patient. A glomus tumor is also a possibility, but these are most commonly found at the glomus body in the middle ear, making it less likely in this case.
C
1013
C: Fibrovascular polyp. 

Explanation: The findings of an esophageal intraluminal tubular mass of soft-tissue density extending from the pyriform recessus through the esophagus into the stomach lumen, as well as a necrotic polypoid lesion seen on retroflexion are characteristic of a fibrovascular polyp. These are benign lesions originating from the cervical esophagus that can grow long enough to prolapse into the stomach, and can cause dysphagia, regurgitation, and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, which may explain the patient's anemia and positive fecal occult blood test.
C
1014
C: Obtain carotid Doppler.

Explanation: Given the presentation of this case, it would be beneficial to obtain a carotid Doppler. This test can help identify any carotid artery disease that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient's presentation of unilateral blurred vision and retinal abnormalities could be due to circulatory problems in the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the eyes. This is supported by the patient's medical history of hypercholesterolemia, which could contribute to the development of carotid artery disease. Therefore, investigation of the carotid arteries using Doppler ultrasound would be a useful next step.

B: Corneal topography. 

Explanation: In this case, the key finding that guides the next step in management is the presence of corneal edema associated with endothelial guttae. These features are suggestive of corneal endothelial dysfunction. Corneal topography can provide detailed information about the patient's cornea, including its curvature, refractive power, and thickness. It can help in diagnosing various ocular conditions and guiding the management of corneal disease. It's important to note that the treatment with amantadine may be associated with corneal edema, but at this stage discontinuing it may not resolve the current symptoms and may lead to worsening of the patient's essential tremor. Thus, further evaluation with corneal topography is suggested before making any treatment modifications. Before considering surgical interventions like Bilateral Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty, we should have a better understanding and confirmation of the underlying issue causing the corneal edema.

B: Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits and maxillofacial region

Explanation: The patient's symptoms have persisted and worsened despite antibiotic treatment, indicating that the mass may not be solely due to an infection. The computed tomographic imaging provides some detail, but magnetic resonance imaging would offer a more detailed view of the mass and surrounding tissues. This could help identify the exact nature of the mass, its extent, and any potential involvement with nearby structures. Biopsy (option A) could be considered, but imaging should be done first to plan the biopsy and avoid potential complications. Similarly, endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (option C) could be a potential treatment option depending on the cause of the mass, but it would be premature to perform this procedure without further investigation. Continuing to manage with antibiotics and warm compresses (option D) without further investigation would not be optimal given the refractory nature of the patient's symptoms, and it could delay the appropriate treatment if the mass is due to a non-infectious cause.

A: MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast 

Explanation: The new-onset balance difficulties, worsening dysarthria, and slow saccades post-concussion syndrome suggest an underlying central nervous system disorder rather than a primary retinal disease. Thus, an MRI of the brain/orbits, particularly with contrast, would likely provide valuable information about any potential lesions or other abnormalities that might be causing these symptoms. This can help rule out the possibility of tumors, inflammation, or other potential neurological conditions that could be contributing to this patient's issues. Genetic testing, lumbar puncture or an audiogram may be helpful in the diagnostic process after evaluating the MRI result.

C: Hypertrophic lichen planus. 

Explanation: The features described, particularly the yellow hyperkeratotic plaques suggest a diagnosis of Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP), a variant of lichen planus commonly affected by drugs which modulate the immune system. The presentation is different from that of Squamous cell carcinoma (option A) which would be unusual in this context and plaque psoriasis (option B) which is characterized by scales that are silver and not yellow. Keratoacanthoma (option D) is a type of cutaneous condition characterized by benign, rapidly growing, and self-healing squamous proliferation. Considering that the patient's skin condition developed after starting pembrolizumab, a known cause of lichenoid reactions, HLP seems the most plausible diagnosis.

A: Diagnose recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and prescribe metronidazole.

Explanation: Given the patient's recurrence of symptoms and the positive C. difficile toxin PCR, it is likely that he is dealing with a recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI). While it is true that this PCR test can stay positive for weeks to months after successful treatment due to colonization with C. difficile or presence of nonviable organisms, the test positivity in conjunction with his clinical symptoms of abdominal discomfort and increased stool frequency make recurrent CDI a likely diagnosis. During a first recurrence of CDI, it is recommended to prescribe a different antibiotic than was used for the initial infection. 

However, metronidazole was effective initially and could be considered for use once again. If the recurrence persists, it would be necessary to step up the treatment to vancomycin or fidaxomicin. The other options, diagnosing severe CDI, postinfectious altered bowel habits with C. difficile colonization, or refractory CDI don't fit with the patient's presentation and course of disease to this point. A high-fiber diet or fecal microbiota transplantation can be considered in selected situations, but not before trying another round of antibiotics.

D: Glomuvenous malformation. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of painful blue papules, which are exquisitely tender, partially compressible, and worsen in pain throughout the day, is typical of glomuvenous malformations. This condition usually presents at birth or during childhood and can progressively enlarge, getting more painful with time. It characteristically involves any part of the body, including the face, extremities, and mucosal surfaces. The cobblestoned appearance is also considered a characteristic feature of these lesions. While blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, venous malformations, and hemangiomas can present similar symptoms, they are less likely to be associated with the intense pain described by the patient, particularly pain that worsens as the day progresses. Furthermore, the familial nature of glomuvenous malformations - though not presented in this case- differentiates it from the other conditions. Therefore, the glomuvenous malformation is the most likely diagnosis for this case.

B: Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis

Explanation: The history of childhood onset and slow progression, site distribution, clinical aspect of the papules, similar lesions in a sibling, and exclusion of systemic manifestations in both patients are findings that are consistent with hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis (HPMH). HPMH is a rare condition characterized by small to large, soft, skin-colored to erythematous papules or nodules, often found on the face, but they can exist anywhere else on the body as well. The condition typically begins in childhood and slowly progresses over years without spontaneous regression. A familial occurrence is noted. Histologically, it is characterized by deposition of mucin in the upper and mid dermis.

D: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms (fevers, weight loss, productive cough, and cutaneous ulcers), along with his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and recent positive c-ANCA testing, are consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). 
GPA is a small-vessel vasculitis that often involves the lungs, kidneys, and upper respiratory tract, causing a wide range of symptoms. This autoimmune disease is characterized by the presence of c-ANCA/PR3-ANCA antibodies, granuloma formation, and necrotizing vasculitis. The occurrence of chronic sinusitis, lung inflammation, and kidney inflammation can strongly suggest GPA. 
Disseminated tuberculosis and nocardiosis usually show specific clinical signs and positive cultures, which are absent in this case. Likewise, paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum, an inflammatory skin condition associated with certain cancer types, could be a possible diagnosis considering the patient's lung cancer. However, the positive c-ANCA and the absence of pathergy (rapidly developing skin ulcers after minor trauma, which is characteristic of pyoderma gangrenosum) make GPA a more likely diagnosis.

D: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation along with MRI findings are highly suggestive of Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This is a hereditary cerebral small vessel disease known to cause strokes and dementia. MRI findings of multiple white matter lesions in a patient with neurological symptoms strongly suggest CADASIL. Amyloid angiopathy generally presents with cerebral hemorrhage and doesn't typically cause spinal cord lesions. Multiple cavernous malformations usually present with seizures or hemorrhage, both not presented in the case. Metastatic melanoma is less likely given the absence of a known primary tumor or widespread systemic involvement. In contrast, CADASIL commonly presents with a family history of stroke or psychiatric disorders which seems to align well with the presented case.

1024
C: Herpes zoster 

Explanation: This case presents with classic lesions of herpes zoster or shingles, characterized by grouped vesicles on an erythematous base distributed along a single dermatome. The patient's history of vaccination and localized rash only on one side of the body further support this diagnosis. Shingles results from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which lies dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after primary infection (chickenpox). Herpes zoster is less common in children but can occur, especially in those who are immunocompromised, although this does not seem to be the case here. Importantly, toddlers who received the varicella vaccine can still develop shingles, but it is usually a milder case than in children who had natural varicella infection. Other differential diagnoses such as Microcystic lymphatic malformation (ovanform of lymphangioma), Eczema herpeticum (Kaposi varicelliform eruption − a disseminated herpes infection occurring in patients with a preexisting skin condition), and a Hypersensitivity reaction are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation. Treatment involves antiviral drugs, symptomatic treatment for pain, and prevention of secondary bacterial infection.

C: Herpes zoster

Explanation: The monomorphic eruption, regional distribution following a dermatome and the temporal association with vaccination suggests a diagnosis of herpes zoster. Herpes zoster in a vaccinated child is typically mild, without pain or post-herpetic neuralgia. Vaccination aims at reducing the severity and complications of diseases, it does not necessarily eliminate the chance of getting infected. Although this child had been vaccinated, it is possible for the varicella vaccine to reactivate as herpes zoster. Hence, option C: Herpes zoster seems most appropriate.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Herpes zoster

Explanation: The clustered, monomorphic vesicular eruption in this patient is most indicative of Herpes Zoster, also referred to as "shingles". The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause Herpes Zoster when it reactivates, and it often presents as a unilateral, dermatomal rash. Although this child had been vaccinated, the varicella vaccine's protection can vary, and breakthrough disease can still occur. The patient's recent immunization along the same dermatome may have led to a transient localized decrease in cell-mediated immunity, which could have allowed the VZV to reactivate and cause Herpes Zoster. Furthermore, the fact that the rash did not bleed, ulcerate, weep, or appear itchy or painful, but it did seem uncomfortable, also suggests Herpes Zoster, as it typically presents with painful or paresthesic lesions before progressing to a vesicular rash. The other options (Microcystic lymphatic malformation, Eczema herpeticum, Hypersensitivity reaction) are less likely given the clinical features of this case.

B: Liposarcoma

Explanation: The presence of a large retroperitoneal mass in this patient, coupled with his significant weight loss, night sweats, leukocytosis, and anemia, suggest a diagnosis of Liposarcoma. This is a type of malignant tumor that arises from fat cells in deep soft tissue, such as that inside the retroperitoneum. It is often large and can displace other organs and create pressure, resulting in symptoms such as the abdominal discomfort described here. Furthermore, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are known risk factors for developing this type of neoplasm. While other options mentioned can also present with similar manifestations, the characteristics in the presented case point more towards Liposarcoma.

This condition occurs when the cecum becomes twisted around its mesentery, leading to intestinal obstruction. Typical symptoms include pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension, as seen in this patient. This is a surgical emergency, as continued twisting can lead to strangulation of the bowel and necrosis.

D: Admit the patient and consult neuro-ophthalmology.

Explanation: While options A, B, and C could contribute to overall management, the immediate next step should be to consult a specialist. Given the abnormal fundus findings, there may be other changes not visible in the examination which need to be assessed further by a neuro-ophthalmologist. This approach will help ensure that further testing and referrals are appropriate for the patient's specific condition. It's important to rule out serious causes of optic nerve abnormality such as brain tumors, optic neuritis, glaucoma etc, for which a neuro-ophthalmology consultation would be crucial. Also, the presence of bilateral papilledema often indicates a serious, potentially life-threatening, systemic condition such as intracranial pressure which needs evaluation from an experienced neuro-ophthalmologist. In this case, an urgent referral seems more appropriate than immediate testing.

Therefore, a lymph node biopsy would be crucial in identifying whether the hypersensitivity is a result of malignancy. Despite ocular involvement, the biopsy of the iris nodule would likely not offer much insight. Uveitis resistant to treatment with steroids, hyperemia, and the presence of hypoyon also suggest malignancy or systemic immune response. The absence of infection markers makes option C and D less likely. Hence, performing a lymph node biopsy seems to be the reasonable next step.
C: Obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement 

Explanation: The patient's severe hemodynamic instability and refractory pulmonary edema, as well as the abnormal function of the mechanical mitral valve, signal the need for immediate surgical intervention. This situation constitutes a high risk for continuing cardiogenic shock and increasing organ damage if delayed. In this case, the intravenous unfractionated heparin (option A) or thrombolysis (option B) may not be sufficient to handle the degree of prosthetic valve dysfunction and the patient's severe hemodynamic instability. Empirical antibiotics for prosthetic valve endocarditis (option D) might also not address the immediate life-threatening problem adequately as there's no evidence of infection presented in the case. It's more likely a mechanical issue with the valve, not an infection. Therefore, urgent consultation for surgical valve replacement and patient stabilization should be pursued.

B: Tracheocele

Explanation: A tracheocele, also known as a paratracheal air cyst, is a rare dilation of the trachea that can occur congenitally or as a result of surgery, trauma, or infection. The case presented fits the description of a tracheocele. In the scenario depicted, the patient underwent surgery for insular carcinoma, which included dissection around the trachea. Later, an air-filled cavity that communicates with the trachea was observed, consistent with a tracheocele. The cystic mass revealed respiratory epithelium lining, absence of thyroid, lung, smooth muscles and cartilaginous tissues, further supporting the diagnosis of a tracheocele.

D: Laryngeal neurofibroma.

Explanation: The clinical findings and histopathology observed in this infant girl – the presence of light-brown skin macules, inspiratory stridor, snoring, retractions during sleep, submucosal supraglottic mass on laryngoscopy and MRI, and tissue composed of bundles of spindle cells in a stroma of coarse collagen and a loose myxoid matrix – are highly suggestive of a neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors that can affect infants and are associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder often featuring light-brown skin macules (also known as café-au-lait spots). Laryngeal involvement is rare, but can induce airway obstruction and voice changes, such as hoarseness, which align with the infant's clinical presentation. Thus, the most fitting diagnosis appears to be a laryngeal neurofibroma. Other options like laryngeal sarcoid, granular cell tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma are less likely considering the clinical and histopathological findings.

1032
A: Submandibular duct sialocele

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of swelling and pain, associated with eating, followed by the discovery of a cystic lesion in the right sublingual space following a thorough examination and further developing subsequent to a thermal injury, are indicative of a sialocele. A sialocele is a submandibular duct cyst that forms following trauma or obstruction of the salivary gland. The discovery of high-grade stricture in the right submandibular duct further suggests blockage in the salivary flow, leading to backfill, expansion, and finally rupturing of the duct with resultant mucin spillage into the surrounding tissue creating a pseudocyst (sialocele). The pathologic analysis revealed inflammation and cystic space, further supporting that diagnosis. Therefore, considering the clinical, radiological, and pathological findings, the diagnosis is likely a submandibular duct sialocele (option A).
A
1033
D: Necrotic epiglottitis.

Explanation: The presence of considerable erythema and edema of the epiglottis with patchy necrosis partially obstructing the glottis and saliva pooling in the supraglottis are strong indicators of necrotic epiglottitis. The patient's non-respondent to antibiotics treatment further supports this diagnosis. It is crucial to remember that necrotic epiglottitis could potentially be a life-threatening condition requiring immediate treatment. Other options like Candidosis, Diphtheric laryngitis, and Pseudomembranous epiglottitis may show similar symptoms but would not present severe necrosis as is the case here. Furthermore, Candidosis and diphtheric laryngitis would typically respond to antibiotics therapy, which was not effective in the patient's case. Pseudomembranous epiglottitis would also exhibit pseudomembranes which are not mentioned here. As such, Necrotic epiglottitis appears to be the most plausible diagnosis.
D
1034
B: Check antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme.

Explanation: 
Based on the presented systemic and ocular conditions, checking for immunologic markers such as antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme would be beneficial. This is due to the fact that the presented symptoms correlate significantly with those of an inflammatory or immunologic syndrome. It seems like the patient's condition could be related to a systemic vasculitic or autoimmune process. Lab testing is essential to guide any systemic therapeutic approach, since the condition potentially has broad systemic implications. Other options listed, like panretinal photocoagulation, may eventually be a part of the therapeutic regimen but should follow after immunologic testing and corresponding diagnosis. Administering corticosteroids and conducting plasmapheresis without diagnosing the underlying cause could potentially harm the patient by concealing the inflammatory markers that are being tested for. Thus, starting off with the immunologic tests for diagnosis is vital.

B: Conduct genetic testing. 

Explanation: The co-occurrence of multiple ocular and systemic findings (engorged and tortuous retinal vessels with peripheral tractional retinal detachment, pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cyst, and bilateral adrenal gland resection) suggests the presence of a systemic genetic condition. This could possibly be Von Hippel-Lindau disease, a rare, genetic multi-system disorder characterized by the formation of tumors and fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in multiple parts of the body. Differential diagnoses could be evaluated through further ocular examinations and systemic evaluations. However, reaching a definitive diagnosis would greatly benefit from genetic testing, which could target potential pathogenic mutations in the VHL gene. A definitive diagnosis could guide management and treatment decisions, including any ocular or systemic surveillance for associated conditions. While a retinal biopsy could potentially provide further information about morphological changes and guide therapeutic strategies, it is more invasive than genetic testing and could carry a risk of complications. Thus, genetic testing would be an appropriate next step.

B: Add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia

Explanation: The patient's recent history of allogeneic stem cell transplant, ongoing immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease, and radiographic findings of diffuse ground-glass opacities are all suggestive of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). This is a life-threatening infection in immunosuppressed patients. The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is typically the first-line therapy for suspected or confirmed PJP, and corticosteroids are added in moderate to severe cases. Her son who recently had a cough might have been the source of the infection. The other mentioned diseases are less likely, given the history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. The CT scan findings when the patient was asymptomatic is a strong argument against a rapidly progressive infection like mucormycosis, and there is no clear indication that this patient has an infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter which warrants a shift to other antibiotics.

C: Leukemia cutis

Explanation: Leukemia cutis is the infiltration of the skin by neoplastic leukocytes, resulting in clinically identifiable cutaneous lesions. It is seen in a minority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The presence of large mononuclear cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio from the skin lesion's biopsy and the positive staining for CD4 and myeloperoxidase, both of which are indicators of myeloid cells, suggest a recurrence of the patient's acute myeloid leukemia in the skin, leading to a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. The patient’s symptoms and the results from the skin biopsy align more closely with leukemia cutis than they do with the other listed possibilities.

1038
C: The patient has an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor.

Explanation: The symptoms and tests of the patient suggest the possibility of a clotting factor inhibitor, which is an uncommon cause of acquired bleeding disorder. In a Mixing study, when the patient’s plasma mixed with normal plasma shows a correction of the prolonged clotting time initially followed by a prolongation of the coagulation time after an incubation period, this is termed an intrinsic factor inhibitor. Both the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were prolonged in the patient's sample alone, but when mixed with normal plasma, only the aPTT remained prolonged. This is indicative of an intrinsic pathway clotting factor inhibitor, which affects Factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. The intrinsic pathway is measured by the aPTT test. Hence the patient is likely to have an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor.

D: Perform a diagnostic test to clarify the diagnosis 

Explanation: As the cause of the symptoms is unclear, the best course of action at this point would be to perform a diagnostic test to better understand the problem. Considering her family history with a similar issue and lack of relief from over-the-counter treatments, this doesn't appear to be a straightforward fungal infection. Also, while numerous options mention treatment with antifungal medications, these should not be administered without a definitive diagnosis of a fungal infection. Indeed, this could represent psoriasis, lichen planus, or another condition that mimics fungal infection. As such, empiric antifungal therapy is not recommended. Hence, option D is the most optimal action to undertake to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

B: Onychopapilloma

Explanation: The Longitudinal Erythronychia (red streaks running down the nail) along with the splitting of the nail indicating a benign nail matrix tumor, coincides with the presentation of an onychopapilloma. This condition, while rare, often presents with a longitudinal erythronychia and nail plate splitting, caused by a benign tumor that is produced in the nail matrix. Furthermore, the patient reported intermittent pain, a common symptom of onychopapilloma. The other options are less likely given the symptoms and imaging findings.

The answer is B: Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi.

Explanation: The clinical and histopathological features described can be attributed to Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi. Spitz nevi are a distinctive variant of benign melanocytic nevi. They are usually solitary. Although multiple lesions have been reported, hundreds of lesions, as in this case, are extremely unusual. In eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi, lesions are usually monomorphic, and the patient is typically a young adult with no other health conditions. The absence of mitotic figures, cells residing primarily at the tips of rete ridges, and absence of Kamino bodies are characteristic histologic findings in Spitz nevi. The lack of notable pagetoid migration further supports a benign diagnosis. In rare instances, Spitz nevi can erupt following sunburn, as in this patient.
Superficial spreading melanoma and metastatic melanoma would present with notably atypical clinical and histologic features, and dermatosis papulosa nigra would not present with lesions on the palms and mucosal surfaces or with cytologic atypia.

D: Verrucous hemangioma. 

Explanation: Verrucous hemangioma is a rare, congenital vascular malformation that manifests as warty plaques on the skin. The hallmarks of this condition, as demonstrated in this case, include its onset in early life, slow growth, occasional bleeding, and histological findings of vascular malformation within both the superficial and deep dermis. Histopathological features typically include verrucous hyperplasia of the epidermis with an underlying vascular component. The extension of the vascular component into the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue differentiates verrucous hemangioma from angiokeratoma, which is restricted to the papillary dermis. The findings of recurrent infections, oozing, and bleeding after minimal trauma are also suggestive of verrucous hemangioma. Hence in this case, the clinical features and histopathological findings are consistent with verrucous hemangioma rather than malignant melanoma, verruca vulgaris, or angiokeratoma circumscriptum.
D

1043
B: Tuberculous spondylitis

Explanation: The combination of back pain, systemic inflammatory markers, vertebral destruction, paravertebral mass (abscess), and hilar lymphadenopathy is suggestive of Pott's disease, or tuberculous spondylitis. This condition, although rare, can occur in children and the suggestion of vertebral destruction and paravertebral abscesses makes this diagnosis plausible. The lack of a significant change in height might also be a result of the spinal disease. Although tuberculosis is not commonly seen in the United States, it can take a more insidious course in children and occur in those who have not traveled to endemic areas. It is a more likely diagnosis than Ewing sarcoma (which is a primary bone tumor typically presenting with systemic signs such as fever, weight loss), diskitis (which wouldn't typically show vertebral destruction or a paravertebral abscess), or pyogenic osteomyelitis (which wouldn't typically show hilar lymphadenopathy).

B: Thymolipoma

Explanation: The large size of the mediastinal mass, combined with its fat density and compression of adjacent cardiac structures, is most consistent with a diagnosis of thymolipoma. This is a rare benign tumor of the anterior mediastinum, composed mainly of mature adipose tissue and thymic tissue, often arranged in a distinct 'ribbon-like' pattern. The other options, such as thymoma, myelolipoma, and mediastinal lipomatosis, are less likely given the characteristics of the mass on radiologic imaging and the absence of particular hormonal markers.

A: Right colon ischemia

Explanation: The patient's report of abdominal pain, followed by symptoms of distension, vomiting, and localized right lower quadrant tenderness hint towards the possibility of ischemia or necrosis subsequent to embolization of the right colic artery branch. These symptoms would likely not be present in case of endoscopic perforation, retained intraluminal old blood, or diverticular perforation. Although these other options cannot be entirely ruled out, the recent history of arterial embolization makes right colon ischemia a more plausible diagnosis. The CT scans were unremarkable, which may be initially encountered in cases of bowel ischemia. Additionally, there was no clear evidence of perforation or retained old blood. Therefore, given the patient's history and presentation, right colon ischemia due to embolization appears to be the most likely diagnosis.

B: Initiate uveitis workup and begin topical glucocorticoid therapy 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests a uveitis condition. The ocular findings, including the elevated white chorioretinal lesions, vitreous haze, and mild optic disc edema, are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis. The symptoms of fever, weakness, and decreased appetite post-surgical procedures may be a systemic inflammatory response which could have triggered this ocular inflammation. Given these, a systemic evaluation for uveitis should be initiated to identify its cause and manage it accordingly. Concurrently, application of topical glucocorticoids can assist to reduce inflammation and halt the progression of symptoms as further diagnostic evaluations are conducted. Other options such as intravitreal injections or pars plana vitrectomy are generally considered more invasive procedures and may not be initially required unless certain ocular infection or other retinal abnormality presents. Urinalysis may not directly help in this case because uveitis would not typically be directly linked to a urinary tract condition, although his recent urologic procedures could have heightened systemic inflammation.

C: Obtain specular microscopy. 

Explanation: Given the findings of mild corectopia and iridocorneal touch nasally with high peripheral anterior synechiae, this patient might have Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. This condition, which is characterized by various anterior segment abnormalities including corectopia and peripheral anterior synechia and systemic anomalies, is commonly associated with altered corneal endothelial cell structure and function. Specular microscopy, which images the corneal endothelium, may reveal classic changes such as dark areas signifying reduced cell density, pleomorphism, and polymegathism. Genetic testing could be considered but is probably not necessary for diagnosis. Treatment with pilocarpine eyedrops is often not effective and there are no effective antiviral drugs for human herpes virus 1 that could be used as eye-drops. Therefore, testing the aqueous fluid for this virus is unlikely to be beneficial.

D: Order catheter cerebral angiography. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of unilateral proptosis, ocular injection with tortuous vessels, mild optic nerve hyperemia, and a dilated superior ophthalmic vein without an identifiable mass indicates the presence of a vascular process. Vascular malformations can be divided into low-flow (capillary, venous, and lymphatic malformations) and high-flow (arteriovenous malformations and fistulas) lesions. A significant number of high-flow lesions, such as carotid-cavernous fistulas, may not be identified on standard radiological imaging such as CT or MRI scans and thus require more specific intervention such as catheter cerebral angiography for diagnosis. Therefore, the next logical step in this patient’s management would be to order a catheter cerebral angiography (option D).

D: Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement in the left eye.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms including decreased vision, tearing, photophobia, and burning - along with the physical findings such as a white cataract and iris heterochromia in his left eye, the most appropriate next step would be treatment of the cataract. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement would allow for removal of the white cataract and restoration of vision. The B-scan ultrasonography didn't reveal any indication for masses, retinal detachment, or foreign body, which makes the other options less likely. A CT or MRI might be reserved for situations where there's suspicion of an intraocular foreign body not detected through ultrasound or when there is an unclear view of the fundus or severe eye trauma which can't currently be confirmed.

D: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Explanation: The clinical picture of acute LV systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the apex and midventricle sparing the base, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock in the presence of negative serum levels of troponin and creatine phosphokinase is typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is often triggered by acute medical illnesses, surgeries, or emotional stress. Additionally, this woman's cerebral hemorrhage could have been the trigger for the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The absence of significant coronary artery disease in the recent angiogram further supports this diagnosis. While vasospasm leading to myocardial infarction could be a consideration, the distribution of the akinesis is not consistent with a single coronary artery territory. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema would not typically lead to such severe cardiomegaly and ventricular dysfunction. Pulmonary embolism could cause RV dysfunction but would not typically cause isolated LV dysfunction as seen in this case.

B: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

Explanation: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a slow-growing, infiltrative dermal tumor characterized by a spindle cell proliferation arranged in a storiform pattern. DFSP is distinguished by a specific chromosomal translocation t(17;22)(q22;q13) that results in the fusion of the collagen type I α1 (COL1A1) gene with the platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFβ) gene. This leads to overexpression of PDGFβ, which acts in an autocrine manner to stimulate the expansion of the tumor cells. Symptoms include painless, asymmetrical lump or swelling, which matches the case in question. Immunohistochemical staining patterns like diffuse positivity for CD34, positivity for bcl-2, and negativity for CD99 and S-100, along with the results from the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), corroborate the diagnosis. The patient's lack of palpable parotid mass, lack of skin changes, and non-diagnostic FNA further support this conclusion.
B
1052
B: Bilateral malleus fixation 

Explanation: The diagnosis of bilateral malleus fixation is most consistent with this patient's clinical presentation. Malleus fixation is a rare middle ear disorder characterized by the attachment of the malleus bone, responsible for conducting sound vibrations, to the ear canal wall. This condition leads to a light to moderate conductive hearing loss, as seen in this case. The main diagnostic sign in a CT scan is a thickened anterior malleal ligament, usually on both sides.
The other conditions listed can also cause CHL, but the normal otoscopic finding, specific indications in the audiogram and the CT scan results are most consistent with a malleus fixation.
B
1053
B: Supraglottic paraganglioma

Explanation: The lesion observed prominently on a man in his 50s from the free margin of the suprahyoid epiglottis demonstrates it is a supraglottic neoplasm. The presentation of a highly vascularized (hypervascular) neoplasm which is capsulated, oval, with regular margins, and without presenting signs of deep tissue invasion (as suggested by the contrast MRI), aligns with the characteristics of a paraganglioma. A hemangioma often presents as an irregularly shaped non-encapsulated mass, and its high vascularity lacks nodularity. Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of skeletal muscle and uncommon in the supraglottic larynx; these tumors are usually less vascular. Lastly, a laryngeal squamous papilloma tends to be a superficial and less vascular lesion compared to paragangliomas. So, the answer "B: Supraglottic paraganglioma" would be the best option. Such type of neoplasm can be treated successfully with surgical excision as done with the patient in the presented case. However, it's important to remember that this determination must be confirmed with histological examination after surgical removal.
B
1054
C: Parathyroid lipoadenoma

Explanation: The elevated serum ionized calcium level along with normal PTH and slightly elevated 24-hour urinary calcium level in this young man, suggest a disorder of the parathyroid gland. Also, histology of the excised tissue showing thinly encapsulated parathyroid tissue with approximately 30% displaying myxoid stromal change and a focal presence of interspersed adipocytes is characteristic of parathyroid lipoadenomas. Lipoadenomas are benign, rare variants of parathyroid adenomas which are characterized by the presence of large amounts of fat within the adenoma. They can cause primary hyperparathyroidism, as could be the case in this patient. It is crucial to rule out hyperplastic parathyroid, parathyroid carcinoma, and parathyroid lipohyperplasia as they present differently and require a different clinical approach.
C
1055
B: Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma 

Explanation: The patient's long-standing history of pruritic cutaneous lesions refractory to antibiotics coupled with the histopathological findings of large CD30+ lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli are characteristic of primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL). PC-ALCL is a type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, a group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas that primarily impact the skin. Your symptoms of areas of skin returning to normal after lesion onset, even in absence of antibiotic exposure, correspond with how PC-ALCL has a waxing and waning nature as spontaneous remission of some lesions is not uncommon. The CD30+ expression (which typically on cutaneous lymphoma lesions is at least 75%) and large size of these cells can differentiate this diagnosis from other CD30+ lymphoproliferative diseases such as lymphomatoid papulosis (in which fewer than 75% of the lesional cells are usually CD30+). Additionally, the findings of only scattered S100+ dendritic cells alleviates concerns for a diagnosis of transformed mycosis fungoides as it typically shows more extensive infiltration of S100+ cells such as Langerhans cells in dermis. TCR gene rearrangement testing being negative is also more indicative of PC-ALCL, though it does not completely rule out a T cell lymphoma. Hence, the most likely diagnosis fitting the clinical presentation and histopathological findings is primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

D: The patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and should have the TSH level repeated in 1 to 3 months.

Explanation: The symptoms described by the patient, such as hair thinning, itchy scalp, and cold sensitivity, are common in cases of subclinical hypothyroidism. This is when the thyroid gland is beginning to have trouble maintaining normal thyroid hormone levels but the level has not dropped far enough to register clearly as hypothyroidism. A slightly elevated TSH level might be the first and only sign of this. The absence of other classic hypothyroid symptoms such as fatigue or depression does not rule out the possibility of subclinical hypothyroidism. Repeating the TSH test in 1-3 months can confirm if TSH levels remain elevated over time, which would confirm the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism.

1057
C: Start parenteral thiamine. 

Explanation: This patient’s inability to visually focus, coupled with his anterograde amnesia and confusion, is suggestive of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). WE is a neurologic emergency caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is a crucial cofactor for several cellular metabolic reactions and, in its absence, intracellular metabolic products accumulate and lead to cellular death, most importantly in areas of high metabolic turnover such as the thalami, mammillary bodies, tectal plate, and periaqueductal gray matter. 

In addition to the “classic triad,” patients may experience a peripheral neuropathy that can present as a painful sensory neuropathy. Furthermore, the medial thalamic lesions seen on this patient's MRI are consistent with WE.

The link between Crohn disease, resections, and WE is well documented, especially in the presence of vomiting. The role of thiamine in cellular respiration and the potential for rapidly dividing cells in the basal ganglia to suffer when it is deficient may explain the rapid onset of symptoms in this patient after an operation and vomiting. 

Thiamine must be given promptly to prevent irreversible damage – before glucose-containing fluids are administered, which can aggravate thiamine deficiency. Given that oral thiamine is often insufficient due to malabsorption, parenteral thiamine is required.

B: Vitiligo

Explanation: The presence of round, hypopigmented macules, and a lack of hair growth suggest that the patient is suffering from Vitiligo. Tinea versicolor treatment wasn't successful which further suggests Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a chronic skin condition characterized by portions of the skin losing their pigment. It occurs when skin pigment cells die or are unable to function. The hair growth in the area can be affected, just like in this case. Contrary to Tinea versicolor which is a common fungal infection of the skin, Vitiligo isn't caused by an organism and treatments for infections won't be effective.

C: Antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5 clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis

Explanation: The patient's presenting signs and symptoms such as fatigue, tender ulcerations, hair loss, and weight loss, along with findings from chest CT scan of hilar lymphadenopathy and ground glass opacities suggests systemic involvement. His symmetric swelling of MCPs and IPs, and the ulcers found in distal fingers and palmar IP creases indicate dermatological manifestation. His pulmonary involvement is indicated by bibasilar rales on auscultation. These all fit into the clinical presentation of amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM). Further, the patient also had anti-SSA (Ro) antibodies, that are frequently detected in patients with ADM. The presence of hyperferritinemia, a known risk factor for severe and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease in ADM, also supports this diagnosis. The negative results for other diseases like Sarcoidosis, lymphoma, Systemic lupus erythematosus and presence of antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5, guide us towards clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis that may rapidly progress to ADM which fits most likely with the patient's clinical or systemic manifestations, dermatological and pulmonary involvement.

C: Crystal-storing histiocytosis

Explanation: Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare condition that is often associated with lymphoproliferative disorders such as monoclonal gammopathies. The presence of elevated IgM and a history of splenic marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration in this patient suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. Moreover, the patient's biopsy results, showing interstitial infiltrate of deeply eosinophilic cells in the entire dermis and adjacent subcutis, is consistent with the features of crystal-storing histiocytosis. Other options listed are not closely related to the patient's clinical and pathological findings. Wells syndrome usually presents with a rapidly evolving, intensely itchy dermatitis, while cutaneous amyloidosis commonly causes abnormal deposits of amyloid protein in the skin. Erysipelas is a superficial bacterial skin infection, often caused by streptococcus, and would not show histiocytosis on biopsy.

B: Urea cycle disorder

Explanation: The young man's recurrent coma and refractory status epilepticus, along with elevated levels of ammonia, are significant clues that point towards a urea cycle disorder (UCD). UCDs are a group of inborn errors of metabolism and are characterized by hyperammonemia, a demonstration of impaired urea synthesis. These disorders manifest as episodes of acute encephalopathy that clinically resemble hepatic encephalopathy, as in this case. The man's non-responsive state to lactulose and his normal liver and kidney functions further strengthen the diagnosis of a urea cycle disorder. Reye syndrome is generally associated with aspirin usage and virus-like symptoms, fatty acid oxidation disorders typically show signs of hypoglycemia and cardiomyopathy, and organic acidemias are often accompanied by metabolic acidosis, none of which are this patient's symptoms.

B: Epstein-Barr virus infection

Explanation: The young girl's symptoms and test results indicate mononucleosis, typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This is suggested by the combination of fever, sore throat, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes, puffy eyelids, as well as the presence of an enlarged liver and spleen. The laboratory results, showing an increase in white blood cells particularly lymphocytes and elevated levels of aminotransferases also generally aligns with EBV infection. However, it's important to note this diagnosis would need further confirmation through further tests such as a monospot or EBV antibody testing. Streptococcal pharyngitis symptoms are similar to EBV infection but it typically doesn't cause enlargement of the liver and spleen or elevated aminotransferase levels. Neuroblastoma and Viral hepatitis also cannot explain all the symptoms and lab results.

C: Blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm

Explanation: The presence of bowel sounds in the chest, as well as reported chest discomfort and dyspnea on exertion, may suggest the existence of a diaphragmatic injury. The patient's history of a motorcycle crash and the imaging evidence support the diagnosis of a blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm. Despite the lack of immediate significant injuries reported at the time of the crash, a diaphragmatic tear may have occurred and remained unnoticed until now. Additionally, the emesis bouts could be related to intermittent visceral herniation into the thorax. The air-fluid level seen on imaging also indicates the presence of abdominal contents in the chest, further supporting this diagnosis.

D: Intramural hematoma.

Explanation: The patient's recent myocardial infarction, coronary intervention, and the presentation of a progressive dyspnea pointing to an acute or progressive heart condition. The imagery findings point to the presence of a hypoechoic mass surrounding the anterolateral wall and apex of the left ventricle. This mass is consistent with the characteristics of an intramural hematoma - a collection of blood that forms within the myocardial wall, often due to a rupture of the vasa vasorum or an iatrogenic complication following a coronary intervention. Option A: Pseudoaneurysm due to free wall rupture would likely lead to immediate cardiac tamponade and is life threatening, clashing with the patient's recent dyspnea progression. Options B & C aren't as likely either due to their characteristic symptoms & visual findings not aligning with the patient’s presentation. Therefore, the best diagnosis for this patient is an intramural hematoma - option D.

C: Prescribe oral aciclovir.

Explanation: The presentation of the teenaged boy is suggestive of erythema multiforme which is a hypersensitivity reaction triggered by infections, most commonly Herpes simplex virus, which justifies the use of oral aciclovir in this case. Oral flucloxacillin would be useful for a bacterial skin infection, which does not fit the patient's description. Oral cimetidine could be used as part of managing gastric pathology, which is also not apparent in the described case. Wait and observe would be a less appropriate approach given the rapid spread of the lesions and the discomfort to the patient. Therefore, given the most probable diagnosis, aciclovir represents the best choice.

C: Start topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops.

Explanation: The child is displaying signs of keratitis, a condition where the cornea becomes inflamed, often due to an infection or injury. In this case, the keratitis is not linked to an identifiable injury or infection, indicated by the lack of stromal scarring or Haab striae. Therefore, initiating treatment such as topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Both cyclosporine and steroids have been used to manage various forms of keratitis, including punctate keratitis displayed by the child. Option A is not suitable as electroretinogram primarily diagnoses retinal disorders. Option B might not be necessary as there are no strong signs indicative of an infection. Lastly, when it comes to option D, simply observing is not the best choice given that the child has been experiencing intense photophobia for a prolonged period, suggesting that an active treatment may be required.

C: Perform an immediate lumbar puncture. 

Explanation: The severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, and optic nerve edema of both eyes observed in the patient are suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, which may be secondary to the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. An immediate lumbar puncture is necessary in this case to formally measure the opening pressure and obtain cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. While continued anticoagulation is crucial for the patient's sinus thrombosis, and while antibiotics might be necessary owing to the mastoiditis, neither of these options directly addresses the urgent problem at hand - the likely increased intracranial pressure. An urgent radical mastoidectomy would only be considered if the patient failed to improve with antibiotic therapy or if she developed complications like facial nerve paralysis, brain abscess, or meningitis.

B

Explanation: This patient's neurologic examination is suggestive of a lesion in the right lateral medulla, consistent with Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome). This rare syndrome is most often due to infarction of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory where it supplies the lateral medulla. The characteristic clinical features include contralateral impairment of pain and temperature sensation in the trunk and limbs, ipsilateral impairment of pain and temperature sensation in the face, Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis), dysphagia, dysarthria, and ataxia suggestive of a cerebellar lesion. The Horner syndrome is due to involvement of the oculosympathetic pathway in the lateral medulla. Because this individual presents with neurologic symptoms, it would be necessary to order magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine to assess for possible lesions. The results could confirm the presence of brain and spinal cord abnormalities and establish a definitive diagnosis.
D: Perform serum and urine immunofixation and light chain determination.

Explanation: This case results in a clinical suspicion of a systemic disorder, possibly amyloidosis or a variant, as an underlying cause for the patient's observed pattern of cardiac disease, represented by the diffuse epicardial enhancements and myocardial edema on CMR imaging and the ST-segment elevation derivatives on EKG. Amyloidosis often results in restrictive diastolic filing and heart failure, as indicated by the patient's echocardiographic and BNP data. Thus, checking for serum and urine light chains and performing immunofixation can help confirm or rule out such a diagnosis. The patient's AGE level is not raised, which reduces the possibility of sarcoidosis. Therefore, before deciding on immunosuppressive therapy guided by PET/CT, which carries risks, it would be preferable to rule out infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis.

D: Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor. 

Explanation: The features in histopathological findings with ossifying rim, atypical cells, increased mitotic activity, and a myxoid stroma highlight the characteristics of a "Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor". This rare soft tissue tumor exhibits distinctive histological features like those seen in this case. Furthermore, the unresponsiveness to antibiotics and location in the sinuses is more consistent with this diagnosis. Negative immunostains for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP also validate this choice. The progressively increasing pain, obstruction, and numbness reinforce the malignity and aggressive growth nature of this tumor. Comparatively, the other options do not fit the clinical and radiographic picture as comprehensively.
D
1071
A: Lipoma

Explanation: The pathology report from the case reveals a mass with a papillary-like architecture, expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue, and variable amounts of fibrous tissue. This fits the description of a lipoma, which is a benign tumor composed of adipose tissue. The other options, such as vocal cord polyp, squamous papilloma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma, do not typically present with such histological findings. Vocal cord polyps and squamous papillomas feature squamous epithelial proliferation, which is not detailed in this report. The adenoid cystic carcinoma typically features a mixture of cystic, solid, and tubular growth patterns, which are also not cited in this pathology report. Thus, the diagnosis of a lipoma is most consistent with the identified histological features.
A
1072
B: Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery

Explanation: The imaging findings, particularly from the MRI scan, suggest a possible vascular lesion. The intense enhancement of the oval black area in the upper part of the sinus on T2-weighted images after gadolinium administration is indicative of flow phenomena, which is consistent with the diagnosis of an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Also, there was no clear separation between the hyperenhancing area in the sphenoid sinus and the bright signal of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus, further supporting an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm. The other answer choices are less likely given the imaging findings and clinical presentation.
B
1073
C: Kimura disease

Explanation: The clinical presentation, radiological findings, and distinctive pathologic features in this case are consistent with Kimura disease. This rare, chronic inflammatory disorder is most commonly seen in Asian men and is characterized by painless tumor-like masses involving the salivary gland and associated lymphadenopathy. Histologically, the disease presents as follicular hyperplasia with copious infiltration of eosinophils which was seen in this patient. Moreover, the significant increase in eosinophil count and IgE level in blood are also typical diagnostic markers of Kimura disease. Although the other conditions mentioned can present with similar symptoms, the set of findings in this case are best described by Kimura disease.
C
1074
C: Laryngeal saccular cyst

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, clinical findings, radiological imaging as well as the surgical and pathological results indicate a large, benign, cystic mass in the larynx. Laryngeal Saccular Cyst matches this description as these are benign dilated saccules filled with mucus that can develop within the larynx leading to symptoms like hoarseness, breathing difficulties, and the sensation of a foreign body in the throat. Laryngeal carcinoma typically presents with more severe symptoms and associated risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use. Laryngocele usually presents as an air-filled dilation of the laryngeal ventricle and is associated with increased intralaryngeal pressure. Thyroid cartilage chondroma is a rare benign tumor of the larynx and typically does not present as a cystic mass.
C
1075
C: Idelalisib-induced colitis.

Explanation: Idelalisib is a drug used for the treatment of certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. One of the significant side effects can be diarrhea, which might further progress to colitis. In this case, considering the patient's ongoing medication with idelalisib and her presenting symptoms of abdominal cramping, and bloody diarrhea, idelalisib-induced colitis is a reasonable diagnosis.
Despite the gastrointestinal symptoms, her laboratory evaluation shows no signs of infection or significant changes in liver function, further ruling out diagnosis A: cytomegalovirus infection and it also doesn't support B: lymphomatous polyposis.
Lastly, Ischemic colitis (option D) generally occurs in older patients and typically has characteristic imaging findings which were not mentioned in the given scenario.
Therefore, idelalisib-induced colitis (option C) is most consistent with this patient's clinical presentation.

1076
C: Measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins

Explanation: The patient's findings of painless, hollow, mildly hemorrhagic vesicles, erosions, and new and old scars mainly on sun-exposed areas along with the spared palms are suggestive of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). PCT is the most common form of porphyria and results from a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, leading to the accumulation of photosensitive porphyrins in the skin. Triggering factors include alcohol consumption, smoking, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus. Our patient's chronic alcohol use, significant past tobacco use, and outdoor occupation are risk factors for PCT. Hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, and sclerodermoid changes can also occur but aren't present in this patient. PCT can be confirmed by measuring higher-than-normal levels of urine and serum porphyrins. While the clinical picture is not suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, discontinuing lisinopril (known for causing drug-induced bullous pemphigoid), or testing for coxsackievirus usually linked with hand-foot-mouth disease, the most fitting next step would be to examine urine and serum porphyrin levels to confirm the diagnosis of PCT.

C: Measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins

Explanation: The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, liver enzyme abnormalities, and symptoms of blisters on sun-exposed areas are suggestive of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a condition in which a deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase leads to an accumulation of porphyrins in the skin. Porphyrins are photosensitive and accumulate in the skin, making the skin susceptible to damage from sunlight exposure. When urine and serum porphyrin levels are measured, they are usually found to be elevated in patients with PCT. Additionally, this condition is commonly associated with alcohol abuse, smoking and liver disease — all of which are present in this patient's history. Therefore, the next best step would be to measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins for definitive diagnosis.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C

Explanation: The patient's painless vesicular eruption with spared palms, a lack of mucosal involvement, and moderate elevations of liver enzymes are consistent with pseudoporphyria, which is best evaluated by measuring levels of urine and serum porphyrins (option C).

Pseudoporphyria mimics porphyria cutanea tarda and is characterized by cutaneous fragility, blisters, erosions, dyspigmentation, and milia that primarily affect sun-exposed skin. However, unlike porphyria cutanea tarda, pseudoporphyria does not involve true enzymatic defects in heme synthesis; instead, it is a phototoxic reaction that likely results from the accumulation of uroporphyrins after exposure to ultraviolet A radiation, certain drugs, and/or liver disease. 

Lisinopril, a common cause of pseudoporphyria, may not be implicated in this case, as discontinuing the drug may not lead to prompt improvement and could complicate the management of the patient's hypertension (option B). The absence of pruritus and the distribution of the lesions make bullous pemphigoid unlikely (option A). The patient's age and absence of oral lesions or fever make hand-foot-mouth disease less likely (option D).
Max retry attempts reached for question 1077. Skipping this question.
C: The patient has microscopic polyangiitis.

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical presentation and test results, the most likely diagnosis is microscopic polyangiitis. This is a systemic, necrotizing vasculitis that affects small blood vessels and is commonly associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). The clinical manifestations of microscopic polyangiitis often include weight loss, anorexia, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and renal involvement — all of which are seen in this patient. Additionally, the patient had a negative antiglomerular basement membrane antibody test, making Goodpasture syndrome a less likely diagnosis. This patient's lack of systemic symptoms such as rash, oral ulcers and arthritis makes systemic lupus erythematosus unlikely. Pneumonia with sepsis is also unlikely given her lack of fever and normal white blood cell count.

D: Follicular lymphomatoid papulosis. 

Explanation: Given the patient’s clinical history, physical examination, and her histopathologic findings (not described in this case), a diagnosis of follicular lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is most likely. This condition is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), which often presents as recurrent crops of small, pruritic, folliculocentric, scaly, and erythematous papules that spontaneously resolve without scarring. The papules are noted on the trunk, extremities, and buttocks and are typically devoid of systemic symptoms. The condition has a prolonged clinical course with cycles of waxing and waning of lesions. Most patients with LyP have an excellent overall prognosis, despite the fact that it's technically a type of lymphoma. The other options presented (follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris, follicular psoriasis, and follicular mucinosis) could also present with similar skin lesion morphologies but they don't align as well with all aspects of the presented case. LyP is distinguished by its stereotypical clinical presentation, histopathologic features, and its spontaneous resolution. Thus, the correct answer is D.

B: Reed Syndrome

Explanation: Reed Syndrome, also known as Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC), is a genetic condition that causes skin and uterine leiomyomas (type of benign tumors), as well as an increased risk of kidney cancer. The painful cutaneous nodules this woman presents with are suspect for being cutaneous leiomyomas, a characteristic symptom of Reed Syndrome. Neurofibromatosis, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, and Tuberous sclerosis, are all associated with presence of skin lesions or bumps too, however, they are not typically painful which is a distinctive feature of leiomyomas in Reed Syndrome.

B: Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma

Explanation: Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma (AEGCG) presents as circular red patches with raised borders and often with central clearing or atrophy, as described in this case history. Histopathologically, it is characterized by the presence of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleated giant cells, along with reduction or absence of elastic fibers, which differentiates it from other granulomatous skin diseases. In contrast, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, and necrobiosis lipoidica typically present with different clinical and histological characteristics and were thus likely ruled out by the biopsy and clinical examination in this case. In addition to the primary lesion, AEGCG is associated with a number of systemic symptoms and conditions, potentially including the patient's recurrent headaches.

B: Disseminated herpes infection

Explanation: The widespread, vesicular, crusted lesions are more consistent with neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, option B, Disseminated herpes infection. Absence of lesions in the mother doesn't rule out transmission of HSV as it can occur in the setting of asymptomatic shedding. The empirical treatment with acyclovir also corresponds to tackling a suspected HSV infection. Neonatal Varicella Syndrome (option A) and Congenital Syphilis (Option C) usually present with additional clinical signs. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (Option D) typically presents with seborrheic dermatitis-like eruptions, not vesicular lesions.

1082
C: Gallstone granuloma 

Explanation: Gallstones spilling into the peritoneal cavity during laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a common occurrence and is often without consequence. However, some spilled gallstones can lead to complications such as abdominal pain, abscess formation, and even gallstone granuloma, which is a rare inflammatory response to retained gallstones in the peritoneal cavity. In this case, the patient's recurrent, localized abdominal pain, the findings on imaging of a single calcified mass with local inflamation, and the history of stone spillage during surgery are more consistent with gallstone granuloma. While intra-abdominal abscess (A) could also be a result of spilled gallstones, it typically presents with sepsis or other severe signs of infection, which this patient didn't have. Gallstone ileus (B) is an intestinal obstruction caused by a large gallstone, but usually involves a gallstone eroding through the gallbladder into the bowel, not spilled during surgery. And eroded gallstone into the abdominal wall (D) would likely cause a palpable mass and focal tenderness at the site of erosion, symptoms not reported in this case.

C: Pancreatic pseudocyst

Explanation: A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled sac that can form in the pancreas, often as a result of pancreatitis. It can present with a progressive lump in the abdomen, particularly after a prolonged episode of pancreatitis, which is consistent with the patient's history. The indication of an elevated serum amylase level, which is associated with pancreatic diseases, supports this diagnosis, and the CT scan shows a walled-off fluid collection, typical of a pseudocyst, rather than necrosis or other forms of cystic lesions. The patient's history of alcohol abuse is also a common risk factor for pancreatic disease, including the development of pseudocysts. Although other types of cysts might also present with an abdominal mass, they are less likely given this patient's specific history and symptoms.

B: Inject an intravitreous gas bubble to displace the implant.

Explanation: Intravitreous gas injection could be considered as a less invasive procedure compared to neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser release or pars plana vitrectomy. The gas bubble will slowly be absorbed by the eye and has the potential to move the implant away from the visual axis. This could reduce the patient's disturbing symptoms caused by the implant. The other options though feasible could be considered if this less invasive method fails or is not suitable for the patient.

B

Explanation: The patient’s presentation aligns with acute-onset crystalline lens dislocation, a severe and sight-threatening complication because of the potential for corneal endothelial decompensation and refractory glaucoma. Given the absence of trauma history and the findings supporting systemic connective tissue disease, the patient's pathology appears to be spontaneous. Patients with absence of phenotypic features of connective tissue disorders can still have mutations in fibrillin-1 or collagen genes, or they may have other forms of secondary ectopia lentis. Given the potential for corneal decompensation and refractory glaucoma, early surgical intervention with lensectomies, anterior vitrectomies, and intraocular lens placement will be most beneficial for visual rehabilitation and prophylaxis of the ocular complications associated with crystalline lens dislocation.
B: Examine under anesthesia with peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser. 

Explanation: The appearance of leukocoria, decreased vision, and an intraocular mass strongly suggests a diagnosis of retinoblastoma in a child. An examination under anesthesia with peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser treatment is generally the best next step to confirm this diagnosis and provide treatment. While both magnetic resonance imaging and genetic testing can provide valuable information, they are not the primary steps in this case. Intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medication is not the first line treatment for presumed retinoblastoma. Thus, the most likely best next step is to perform the examination under anesthesia with ancillary testing and possible treatment.

B: Obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy. 

Explanation: As the patient has a lesion that has been gradually enlarging over the years, it is vital to determine the nature of this lesion. A high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy can provide detailed images of the eye's internal structures, aiding in the diagnosis of the lesion. It can help evaluate the lesion’s characteristics, including its location, size, extent, ciliary body involvement, and internal reflectivity, which can help distinguish between various types of iris lesions. This approach can guide the appropriate treatment and help prevent unnecessary invasive procedures or premature excision. It is also important to periodically monitor the lesion following the imaging for any changes or potential malignancy signs. However, definitive diagnosis and treatment plan would require a complete clinical evaluation. Further tests or consults may be recommended based on the ultrasound findings.

D: Perform ECG with right precordial leads. 

Explanation: The evolving ECG pattern of the patient after the PCI suggests a possible complication known as right ventricular infarction. This is suggested by persistent hypotension and the new rSR' in V1-V3. Right ventricular infarction is usually associated with inferior MI, often due to occlusion of the right coronary artery, which was seen in this patient. The missing piece of information is to confirm the right ventricular infarction, which can be done by extending the ECG to include right precordial leads (V4R, V5R, and V6R). These leads will detect ST elevation, which is indicative of right ventricular infarction. This would help guide further management, particularly in maintaining adequate preload and careful use of nitrates and diuretics that could adversely affect right ventricular preload. Hence, the answer would be to perform ECG with right precordial leads.

B: Teratoma

Explanation: The multinodular, solid-cystic nature of the mass, along with its rapid growth postpartum, multiple tissue types on pathologic examination, and presence of calcifications on CT, highly suggests a diagnosis of teratoma. A teratoma is a tumor made up of several different types of tissues, such as hair, muscle, or bone; this correlates with the finding of multiple tissue types in the pathological results. They most commonly occur in the tailbone, ovaries or testes but may also be found in other parts of the body such as the neck in this case. Teratomas are typically benign but can be malignant, especially if they continue to grow rapidly after birth as observed in this case.
B
1090
B: Keratocystic odontogenic tumor

Explanation: The diagnosis of the case is mostly compatible with a Keratocystic odontogenic tumor. This benign but aggressive odontogenic tumor is characterized by its distinct histopathological features: a stratified squamous epithelial lining with a palisading basal cell layer, and a corrugated parakeratin surface. The lesion is often associated with impacted or missing teeth, as was observed in the case with the missing second left mandibular molar, that adds up to the diagnosis. Furthermore, keratocystic odontogenic tumors exhibit a well-defined border and can cause bone deformation due to their expansive growth, mirroring the clinical imaging findings: a well-defined hypodense mass that caused 'smooth remodeling' of the left mandibular ramus. Additionally, the typically cyst-like appearance on MRI and CT imaging, correlates well with the 'squamous-lined cyst' observed on pathologic assessment. Other options such as Lymphangioma, Cystic ameloblastoma, and Cystic schwannoma don't align with the complete pathological and imaging findings.
B
1091
B: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma 

Explanation: 
The extensive craniofacic FD in the patient presents a challenging diagnostic dilemna, given the overlapping imaging, histologic, and clinical features of FD and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. However, the new painful nodules in forehead, the prolonged survival despite stage IV renal cell carcinoma, history of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its known propensity to metastasize to unusual sites, the imaging findings of an FD lesion with new soft tissue mass, and the histologic findings on FNA are all more suggestive of metastasis from clear cell renal cell carcinoma than aggressive behavior from FD. Furthermore, the large round nuclei and abundant clear cytoplasm of carcinoma cells resemble the stromal cells of FD, but the presence of conspicuous nucleoli and atypical nuclei warrant a malignant diagnosis. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma often express pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10 and PAX-8 staining, and can have clear cytoplasm, further supporting this diagnosis.

B
1092
B: Syringofibroadenocarcinoma

Explanation: The characteristic clinical and histological features, along with the location of the lesion, suggest a diagnosis of syringofibroadenocarcinoma. Syringofibroadenocarcinoma is a rare malignant tumor that originates from the sweat glands. It often presents as a slow-growing, solitary nodule or plaque, which may ulcerate, as seen in this patient. Histological findings typically show epidermal proliferation, strands of basaloid cells, ductal differentiation, and intervening fibrovascular stroma, as described in this case. Although it can be difficult to differentiate syringofibroadenocarcinoma from other skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, the aggregate of clinical, radiological, and histopathological information points towards syringofibroadenocarcinoma in this case. It is nonetheless important to confirm the diagnosis with further specialized immunohistochemical studies.
C
1093
D: Epithelioid sarcoma. 

Explanation: The histopathological features reveal the presence of epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm along with areas of necrosis. A significant clue to the diagnosis is the loss of INI-1 staining, which is noted in a majority of Epithelioid sarcomas. In addition, these tumors may show positive staining for cytokeratin and EMA, which is consistent with our patient's findings. Given the ulceration, duration, and non-healing nature of the lesion, a malignant condition like epithelioid sarcoma is a high possibility. Hence, the diagnosis of Ulcerated squamous cell carcinoma, Histiocytoma, and Nodular fasciitis is less likely.
D
1094
B

Explanation: The patient's clinical features (weight loss, chronic fatigue) and physical examination findings (hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases and buccal mucosa) suggest adrenal insufficiency (AI). AI is due to insufficient production of cortisol, and to a lesser extent, aldosterone. Primary AI, also known as Addison's disease, involves abnormality at the level of the adrenal glands that leads to a deficiency in both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. 

Hyperpigmentation occurs due to high ACTH levels, which is produced and released by the pituitary gland in response to low cortisol levels. ACTH shares a common precursor with melanocyte-stimulating hormone, the excess of which leads to increased skin pigmentation. 

The initial laboratory evaluation of suspected AI involves morning serum cortisol and plasma ACTH. Results can show a high ACTH with a low or inappropriately normal cortisol level which is indicative of primary AI. The 250-μg cosyntropin stimulation test helps confirm the diagnosis. Cosyntropin is a synthetic form of ACTH, and failure of cortisol levels to increase following its administration indicates adrenal disease, properly diagnosing primary AI.
B: Erythropoietic protoporphyria

Explanation: The symptoms and biopsy findings describe erythropoietic protoporphyria, a rare hereditary photodermatosis, typically becoming apparent in early childhood. It's characterized by acute, painful, and sometimes edematous skin eruptions that last hours to days after sun exposure. The distinguishing histopathologic findings include endothelial cell swelling and subtle, perivascular fibrosis corresponding to subtle vessel thickening, along with extravasation of erythrocytes and capillary thrombosis, consistent with this patient's biopsy results. Despite being hereditary, it may not appear in all family members due to incomplete penetrance. The other diagnosis options are less likely due to the lack of their typical features or the presence of findings contradictory to this case.

C: Multiple mucosal neuromas in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b 

Explanation: The presence of multiple mucosal neuromas, especially in association with a marfanoid habitus and distinctive orolabial lesions, is characteristic of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN2B). MEN2B is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and multiple mucosal neuromas. The cutaneous and orolabial findings seen in the patient, such as enlarged nodular lips and multiple tongue lesions, along with her limb disproportion, are indicators of this syndrome. The other options (Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, Crohn disease, Lipoid proteinosis) do not typically present with this combination of features.

1097
C: Bacillary angiomatosis

Explanation: The patient's presentation with erythematous papules and nodules with a central crust, dystrophic toenails, and an atrophic hyperpigmented plaque suggest bacillary angiomatosis, typically caused by Bartonella species. It often occurs in patients with compromised immune systems. Bacillary angiomatosis is a vascular proliferative disease that can mimic other skin conditions such as Kaposi sarcoma, but Kaposi sarcoma typically presents more commonly as purple, red, or brown patches or nodules. Disseminated tinea infection usually presents with widespread itchy skin lesions with well-defined borders, often on the trunk and extremities. Leukemia Cutis presents as purple-red papules and infiltrated nodules, however the absence of leukemia or other hematological disorder history in the patient makes this diagnosis unlikely. Therefore, Bacillary angiomatosis (Option C) appear to best fit the patient’s presentation.

1098
B: Nocardial brain abscess

Explanation: The history of the patient's symptoms accounting for a marked deterioration over a two-week period following what was initially perceived as a stroke is indicative of a progressive cerebral process. His history of lung empyema raises suspicion for a potential nocardial infection, which can disseminate to the central nervous system leading to the formation of a brain abscess. The MRI observations—hyperintense signals representing a necrotic lesion surrounded by vasogenic edema—are also suggestive of abscess rather than an infarct. Thus, the consideration of Nocardial brain abscess seems more appropriate. The other options (hemorrhagic brain infarct, metastatic carcinoma, mixed bacterial abscess) can be secondary considerations, but the patient's presentation and previous medical history make a Nocardial abscess most likely. Additional diagnostic studies such as brain biopsy or evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid can further confirm the diagnosis.

D: Obturator hernia

Explanation: The presentation of the case—especially given the patient's recent history of abdominal distention and pain, hyperactive bowel sounds, and the computed tomographic scan showing a mass lesion in the right lower pelvic wall—suggests an obturator hernia, which is a rare type of pelvic hernia. It is more common in older, thin, multiparous women with chronic constipation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Abdominal distension and bowel obstruction are common symptoms of this condition. The bowel sounds might be increased initially, as in this case due to partial small bowel obstruction. The CT scan can clearly show the hernia content and pathway, and confirm the diagnosis. Out of all the provided options, the obturator hernia - option D - best matches the patient symptoms and findings from the CT scan.

D: Retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

Explanation: From the description and the CT scan, it's clear that the man has a large retroperitoneal mass that has displaced the descending colon and enveloped the left kidney. Retroperitoneal fibrosis (A) would typically show on a CT as a sheet-like mass and is not normally associated with displacement of the colon or kidney. Renal cell carcinoma (B) usually originates from the kidneys and does not typically grow to such a size to envelope the intestine. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (C) usually occurs within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract and is less likely to displace the colon in such a way. On the other hand, retroperitoneal liposarcoma (D) is a malignant tumor that can grow very large and displace nearby structures, consistent with the description and presentation of the patient in this case.

1101
C: Perform vitrectomy. 

Explanation: This patient’s presentation is consistent with a postvitrectomy condition—proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)—which is the most common cause of surgical failure in retinal detachment cases. While inflammation or infection could also cause decreased vision and ocular inflammation, these conditions generally do not result in transvitreal bands and sheets but instead cause cells and debris in the vitreous cavity. The fact that culture results were found to be negative from an earlier analysis also lowers the probability of infection. Corticosteroids theoretically may increase the risk of PVR by suppressing the immune system, and their use in this case would not be recommended. Antifungal treatment would be unlikely to benefit this patient without a clear indication of fungal infection. Therefore, a repeat vitrectomy to remove proliferating cells and address any underlying tractional elements would be an appropriate next step in the patient's management.

C: Neuropsychological testing

Explanation: The patient’s symptomatology and the results from her MRI suggest that she may be dealing with a neurodegenerative process. While the MRI has already been done and didn't provide enough insight, the MRI might have been normal in the early stages of the disease. Hence repeating it might not be the most fruitful investigation. In the case of stroke, it had already been ruled out, and in a case of suspected vascular disease, lumbar puncture is not typically performed. Fluorescein angiography is typically used when there is a suspicion of retinal disease, which is also not the current case as the fundus examination was unremarkable. The abnormalities in vision, coupled with the reported issues with short-term memory and easily getting lost might indicate a progressive cognitive disorder such as Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. Hence, a neuropsychological testing is the most logical next step, as it will evaluate for possible cognitive impairment. It can also provide valuable information about the extent and nature of any cognitive problems, which in turn can aid with diagnosis and treatment planning.

B: Adjust topical medications to decrease intraocular pressure and perform visual field testing

Explanation: The patient's presentation with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and reduced endothelial cell count, especially in the right eye, indicates potential glaucoma. The blurry vision and headaches also suggest this. The role of topical medications here is to decrease the IOP, and regular monitoring is crucial due to the risk of optic nerve damage. Visual field testing can provide important information about the extent of damage if glaucoma is present. Although lubrication (option C) could provide some comfort, it doesn't address the urgent issue of elevated IOP. Changing the eye color back (option D) is not likely to reverse the damage that has already occurred due to the previous iris color change procedure.

A: Topical apraclonidine test

Explanation: Considering the patient's symptoms, history and clinical examination, testing with topical apraclonidine should be the next step. The patient's intermittent esotropia could be a symptom of a neurological issue and needs to be further investigated. Topical apraclonidine would help to localize the problem, determine if the Horner's syndrome is present and if so, potentially identify the lesion's location. This test is safe, inexpensive, and non-invasive, and would provide valuable diagnostic information without the risks of other more invasive procedures. Urgent MRI may not necessarily provide additional information to the already stable MRI from a year ago, and there are no symptoms indicating that anti-epileptic treatment with carbamazepine is necessary at this point. Extraocular muscle surgery would typically be considered only if conservative management fails or if there are noticeable and consistent muscle imbalances causing functional or aesthetic issues. For now, the apraclonidine test seems like the most reasonable next step.

B: Sweet syndrome

Explanation: Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, including fever, arthralgia, and a rash composed of tender, erythematous papules and plaques, in conjunction with laboratory results showing leukocyte elevation, normocytic anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is the most likely diagnosis. The histopathological finding of dermal neutrophilic infiltrate on the biopsy further supports this diagnosis. Sweet syndrome is often associated with infections, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders, but in this case, it appears to be related to a recent streptococcal infection, assuming acute rheumatic fever diagnosis. The lesions of Sweet syndrome are typically painful and may appear anywhere on the body, but most commonly they are found on the arms, face, and neck. While Pyoderma gangrenosum could present with similar symptoms, the patient's rapid improvement with systemic corticosteroid treatment strongly suggests Sweet syndrome. The other two options, Papillary dermal edema and Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, are less likely due to the clinical presentation and pathology results.

C: Discontinue flecainide, start amiodarone and warfarin.

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests that she has structural heart disease and arrhythmia, likely secondary to her dilated atria and abnormal diastolic filling. The recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation despite flecainide treatment indicates the need for a change in her antiarrhythmic regimen. In this context, amiodarone could be more effective as it is a potent antiarrhythmic agent which can be used in patients with structural heart disease. Also, considering her history of AF, warfarin should be reintroduced for stroke prevention. The other options can be considered but they may be somewhat invasive (Option B and D) or may not adequately address the underlying heart condition (Option A).

1107
D: Nodular fasciitis

Explanation: The description of a benign spindle cell proliferation arranged in a tissue-culture–like pattern with a myxoid to collagenous stroma is suggestive of Nodular fasciitis. Nodular fasciitis is a benign condition that can mimic more severe conditions such as sarcomas on imaging studies. It is characterized by the rapid growth of fibrous tissue, which can lead to the development of a small mass. It commonly affects the arms and upper body, and it commonly presents as a rapidly enlarging, freely movable, and nontender mass. It often resolves spontaneously. Immunohistochemical stains being positive for actin and negative for cytokeratin and S100 protein are also confirmatory for this condition. The other options do not align as well with the described clinical presentation and pathology.
D
1108
B: Ameloblastic fibroma

Explanation: The detailed imaging examination and histopathological results suggests Ameloblastic fibroma. This is a rare, benign, mixed odontogenic tumor, representing about 2% of odontogenic tumors. Although it typically presents in the first two decades of life, it's uncommon in early infancy, with only a handful of cases reported in patients younger than 1 year. Ameloblastic fibroma occurs in the mandible more often than the maxilla and is usually associated with an unerupted tooth. The tumor comprised of proliferating odontogenic epithelium embedded in a cellular ectomesenchymal tissue resembles dental papilla, and it lacks mineralization or formation of dental hard tissues, as described in the histopathology findings of this case. So, based on the tumor's presentation, its age of onset and histopathologic analysis, it is highly indicative of an Ameloblastic fibroma.
C
1109
C: Tularemia. 

Explanation: Tularemia, a zoonotic infection caused by Francisella tularensis, typically presents with fever, malaise, and regional lymphadenopathy, all of which were experienced by this woman. It typically spreads in humans through insect bites or mammalian hosts including rabbits and rodents. The definitive diagnosis of tularemia is based on serology with a rise in antibody titers in two or more serial specimens, or detection of F tularensis DNA by PCR in clinical specimens, as done here where serum antibody titers were 1:640. This, paired with clinical findings and the negative results for other potential diagnoses makes tularemia the most likely diagnosis.
C
1110
C: Sarcoidosis

Explanation: The presence of bilateral parotid gland enlargement along with chronic rhinosinusitis and noncaseating granulomatous inflammation found in the superficial parotid biopsy raises the suspicion for sarcoidosis. While Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) can also cause sinusitis and noncaseating granulomas, this condition typically presents with upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, neither of which were reported in the patient's symptoms or imaging findings. As for tuberculosis, it generally presents with unilateral parotid involvement, but in this case, the patient has bilateral parotid swelling. Furthermore, the patient's tuberculosis test results were negative. Lastly, Amyloidosis often presents with macroglossia, periorbital purpura, and waxy thickening of the skin, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Furthermore, it does not typically involve the parotid glands. Sarcoidosis better explains the constellation of symptoms and findings in this case, including sinusitis and noncaseating granulomas.
C
1111
B: Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma 

Explanation: The presentation of a cystic, cribriform and papillary growth, along with the presence of clear margins and no evidence of perineural spread or lymphovascular invasion, is suggestive of a low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma (LGCCC). LGCCC is a rare salivary gland tumor characterized by a low-grade and slow-growing course. The positive staining for calponin and p63 in the myoepithelium surrounding the tumor nests is also indicative of this diagnosis. Other options such as Papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma, Warthin tumor and Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma are less likely, given the specific histological features and staining patterns described in the case.
B
1112
B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms signify a systemic issue. This includes shortness of breath, tachycardia, fever, decreased breath sounds, lower extremity edema, and cutaneous necrosis on the ears along with laboratory abnormalities like leukocytosis (predominance of neutrophils), anemia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and DVT. This systemic condition suggests a connective tissue disease, specifically vasculitis. Therefore, checking for antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant (Option B) would help confirm the disease. Although a skin biopsy could be important, the systemic issues indicate that noninvasive methods should first be used for diagnosis. Obtaining a bacterial culture of the skin lesions (Option C) could also be informative, but the negative Gram stain and culture from the pleural fluid suggests that bacterial infection is less likely. The absence of a history of drug use makes a urine drug screen (Option D) less likely to be useful at this stage.
B: Her ascites is primarily due to chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart.

Explanation: The patient's history of pulmonary arterial hypertension presents a plausible cause of the new-onset ascites. When the pressure in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs is too high, it can lead to right-side heart failure and the subsequent fluid build-up in the abdomen (ascites). The lack of alcohol or drug use and no personal or family history of liver disease lessens the likelihood of cirrhosis. Furthermore, her Doppler ultrasound showed an irregular liver echo pattern without lesions, which is not typical of abdominal malignancy. Moreover, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis usually presents with symptoms like abdominal tenderness and fever which is not present in this case. Therefore, given the patient's history and symptoms, the ascites is most likely due to chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart. This rationale supports answer option B.
B

1114
B: Stop azathioprine

Explanation: The patient's presentation of fever, arthralgias, and rash following the commencement of azathioprine suggests a drug reaction. Azathioprine is known to cause hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, rash, and arthralgias. Given the temporal relationship between initiation of azathioprine and the onset of the patient's symptoms, the drug is the most likely cause. Discontinuation of the drug is the first step in management. Restarting the drug could lead to a similar or more severe hypersensitivity reaction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels help in diagnosing conditions like sarcoidosis; corticosteroids are an option for inflammatory conditions but first we have to eliminate possible drug causes; a skin biopsy might be helpful in unclear situations or persistent rashes, but the overall clinical picture strongly suggests a drug-related issue.

Without providing the test results, it's impossible to accurately interpret this scenario and decide whether Lynch syndrome is confirmed, suspected, ruled out, or inconclusive. Therefore, the answer and explanation are dependent on the missing information. The immunohistochemistry staining and MSI testing results will determine the probability of the patient having Lynch syndrome, based on presence or absence of specific DNA mismatch repair proteins. The best approach in this case would be to refer back to the clinician or diagnostic report for detailed analysis.
D: Secondary syphilis

Explanation: The abruptly arising, ulcerative, broad-based papules, localization, and resolution of itching after topical antibiotic and antihistamine treatments are consistent with secondary syphilis. The ulcer on the lower lip could represent a mucous patch. The negative mycobacteria, bacteria, and fungal cultures, as well as the lack of growth of Cryptococcus, the absence of a keratoacanthoma-like pattern, and the presence of numerous plasma cells in the biopsy specimen also point towards syphilis. The Warthin-Starry stain, originally used to demonstrate Helicobacter pylori, will hold spirochetes in the appropriate clinical setting, likely confirming syphilis. This infection is often transmitted sexually, however, autoinoculation could exist when it involves non-genital areas. As this man denies recent sexual activity, it is possible that he contracted this disease many years ago during his period of drug use and that it is now showing clinical signs.

1117
C: Granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. 

Explanation: The perianal skin growths, in combination with the patient's history of Crohn's disease, suggest a possible granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. The appearance of these skin growths, as described, can be part of the extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease. The biopsy results also indicate a granulomatous reaction, which is typical of Crohn's disease. There were numerous multinucleate giant cells surrounded by mature lymphocytes, which usually suggests a strong inflammatory response. Furthermore, the absence of active gastrointestinal symptoms does not exclude the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, as the course of Crohn's disease can vary widely. The other options, such as fibroepithelial polyps, hemorrhoids, or condyloma acuminata, do not typically present with the same histopathologic features seen in this case.

1118
C: Cutaneous sparganosis. 

Explanation: Cutaneous sparganosis presents as an erythematous, edematous, serpiginous, migratory nodule or plaque and can be accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia, as in this patient. The causative agent, Spirometra spp, is endemic in Asia but has been reported globally. Humans are accidental hosts who get infected by ingesting contaminated water, consuming undercooked meat from intermediate hosts (usually frogs or snakes), or using the flesh of these hosts as a poultice. The organs most commonly involved are the eye and brain, making cutaneous sparganosis a rare manifestation of this parasite. Early suspicion and biopsy of these lesions can prevent unnecessary surgery or systemic treatment. The risks of these treatments should be weighed against the low risk of spontaneous migration to vital organs.

1119
A: Calcified hydatid cyst 

Explanation: Given the patient's profession as a sheep breeder and the considerable time she spends in close contact with animals, this significantly raises her risk for zoonotic diseases, such as echinococcosis which is caused by the Echinococcus tapeworm. Echinococcal cysts, or hydatid cysts, can develop in various parts of the body, including the abdomen. The radio-opaque lesion on the x-ray with a smaller lesion within - a 'lesion-in-lesion' appearance - is suggestive of a calcified hydatid cyst. This could account for her abdominal pain. Furthermore, the presentation of anemia might be associated with chronic disease as echinococcosis is a long-term parasitic disease.

1120
B: Congenital splenic cyst

Explanation: The presence of a well-defined, large cystic mass in the spleen with mural calcification, filled with yellowish opalescent fluid and cholesterol-like crystals, is indicative of a congenital splenic cyst. The fact that the patient has no history of abdominal trauma, infection, or surgery eliminates the possibilities of a secondary splenic cyst (caused by trauma or infection) and a splenic abscess (usually preceded by infection). Echinococcal disease is less likely as the patient has no sign of parasitic infection, and lab results do not indicate the presence of an infectious process. Congenital splenic cysts are lined by epithelium, which can produce the cholesterol-like crystals observed in this case.

A: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with gadolinium

Explanation: Given the sudden nature of the vision loss and unremarkable ocular and neurological examination findings, the most likely cause of the woman’s sudden vision loss is a lesion in the optic pathways posterior to the retina, most likely in the optic nerves themselves. Optic nerve lesions would not be expected to produce an afferent pupillary defect if they affect both optic nerves equally. An MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium would be the most appropriate next step to help identify any inflammatory, infiltrative, or neoplastic conditions of the optic nerves, chiasm, or tracts.

1122
D: Schedule transscleral or transvitreal biopsy.

Explanation: The presentation and fundus examination findings lead to a suspected diagnosis of an intraocular tumor. While imaging such as MRI can provide additional anatomical information, it doesn't allow for histopathological analysis to confirm whether the mass is benign or malignant. Similarly, oral prednisone therapy might help with symptoms, but it wouldn't address the underlying cause. Also, while referral to oncology would be necessary if metastatic disease is found, determining the nature of the primary lesion is crucial. Therefore, the next step should be to schedule a biopsy i.e., transscleral or transvitreal, to allow histopathological analysis of the lesion and confirm the diagnosis. This information will guide definitive therapy.

1123
C: Obtain a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion.

Explanation: Given that the patient's vision is declining, the lesion is growing despite wide empirical antimicrobial coverage, and given the absence of systemic infection, next reasonable step should be obtaining a sample of tissue for biopsy from the suspicious lesion. This approach is crucial before including more invasive methods like vitrectomy. Furthermore, the patient's cancer history and recent chemotherapy could suggest the possibility of intraocular metastasis, even though the patient was declared cancer-free 6 months earlier. A biopsy can help confirm or rule out this possibility, thus guiding the next steps in treatment.

1124
C: Embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy

Explanation: Considering the findings from both the computed tomography and conventional angiography of the orbital mass, choice C seems the most appropriate course of action. An ophthalmic artery branch supplying the neuronal mass suggests that the mass is vascularized, implying potential complications such as bleeding upon intervention, hence justifies embolization. Embolization can control this bleeding risk during orbitotomy and biopsy. 

While Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (option A) could help identify the type of mass, but without embolization, it carries a risk of heavy bleeding. Fluorescein angiography(option B) may provide additional information about the blood supply but does not immediately address the mass itself. Observation (option D) may not be appropriate given the size of this mass, which is impacting the patient's vision and causing discomfort. Therefore, the best course of action under these circumstances would be embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy.
C

1125
B: Langerhans cell histiocytosis 

Explanation: The diffuse rash across many areas of the body paired with the appearance of pink to brown nummular patches and plaques with thick white scale is indicative of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). Key features of LCH include seborrheic dermatitis–like eruption with thick scaling that often involves the scalp, ear, axillae, groin, or less commonly, the trunk and extremities. LCH can commonly misdiagnose due to its resemblance to common dermatoses, such as seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, or atopic dermatitis. In this case, Psoriasis often spares the diaper area, Congenital syphilis presents as a generalized rash with involvement of the palms and soles, and Pityriasis lichenoides is rare in this age group and presents with smaller papules and vesicles. Therefore, choice B: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is the best fit for this case.
A
1126
B: Myocardial restriction

Explanation: The patient’s history of radiation therapy and the pattern of her physical findings and hemodynamics suggest that her condition is consistent with myocardial restriction. This condition is characterized by impaired ventricular filling, which results in reduced cardiac output. Symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, and lower extremity edema, are common presentations. The persistent elevation of jugular venous pressure, even after successful diuresis, suggests an ongoing issue with venous congestion, further supporting the diagnosis of myocardial restriction. Her history of radiation therapy would also put her at risk for this condition.

1127
C: Amyloidosis. 

Explanation: The presence of Congo red stain showing apple-green birefringence on polarized microscopy, is a significant marker for Amyloidosis. Additionally, the histopathological images showing sections of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign body giant cell reaction and plasma cell infiltrates further support the diagnosis of Amyloidosis. This condition is characterized by an abnormal protein build-up in tissues and organs, consistent with the patient's presentation of a growing facial mass. The other options like Pleomorphic adenoma, Paraganglioma, or Schwannoma do not typically demonstrate these particular histopathological findings.
C
1128
C: Myeloid sarcoma of the larynx 

Explanation: Myeloid sarcoma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma, is a malignant tumor composed of immature myeloid cells, which can occur in various locations in the body, independent of bone marrow involvement. It is often associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as in this patient. The laryngopharyngeal location is very rare and hoarseness is the most common symptom. The co-expression of myeloperoxidase, CD68, and CD33 but not CD117 is consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma rather than carcinoma, lymphoma, or plasmacytoma. Therefore, based on this patient's clinical history, physical examination and laboratory and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is myeloid sarcoma of the larynx.
C
1129
B: Osseous choristoma

Explanation: The histopathologic findings of mature bony tissue without inflammation in the specimen aligns with the diagnosis of an osseous choristoma, which is a benign lesion composed of normal tissues in an abnormal location. An osseous choristoma is a rare entity, particularly in the oral cavity. Its presence on the tongue is extremely rare. The other options like pleomorphic adenoma, dermoid cyst, and pyogenic granuloma were ruled out based on the histopathological examination results. They usually have different microscopic findings and clinical presentations. The pathognomonic presence of mature bone without surrounding inflammation makes osseous choristoma the most probable diagnosis.
B
1130
A: Thornwaldt cyst

Explanation: This patient’s chronic bilateral nasal congestion, without facial pressure or pain, suggests an obstructive process. The physical examination as well as CT and MRI images reveal a lobulated mass in the nasopharynx, which is suggestive of a Thornwaldt cyst. These lesions arise from persistent embryonic remnants of the primitive nasopharyngeal bursa located at the superior posterior aspect of the nasopharynx. They can cause non-specific symptoms of nasal congestion, post-nasal drip, and slightly offensive nasal odor. Nasopharyngeal carcinomas typically present with unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, or cervical lymphadenopathy. Extraosseous chordomas generally have a lytic component on imaging, not seen in this patient. Meningocele usually presents as a bluish mass in the nasopharynx and would show CSF signal on MRI.
C
1131
B. 

Explanation: The initial step in the evaluation of hematuria is confirming the presence of blood in the urine, this can be accomplished through microscopic urinalysis. A urine dipstick test is sensitive but not specific for hematuria; it can yield false-positive results due to contamination with substances such as menstrual blood, myoglobin, ascorbic acid, or even disinfectants used during or before testing. Therefore, microscopic urinalysis comes in as a more definitive test to confirm the presence of actual red blood cells which is a criteria for diagnosing hematuria. Other steps, such as a CT scan, referral to urology and urine cytology, should be reserved for after confirming the presence of true hematuria.
B: Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome)

Explanation: The lesion distribution along with the Blaschkoid pattern suggests a genetic mosaic disorder, thus ruling out a diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation or incontinentia pigmenti as these conditions are X-linked dominant traits and typically do not present in this pattern. Nevus lipomatosus superficialis doesn't usually involve the nails or mucosal surfaces. Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome) is a rare genodermatosis involving structures derived from the mesodermal and ectodermal layers, often presenting with skin, skeletal, dental, and ocular abnormalities, as exhibited by the patient. Therefore, focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome) seems most likely.

D: Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis

Explanation: The linear and whorled distribution of the vesicles, along with their evolution into hyperpigmented macules, and the absence of infectious etiologies, such as herpes and varicella, all point towards Linear and Whorled Nevoid Hypermelanosis (LWNH). LWNH is a rare pigmentary disorder, characterized by hyperpigmented macules and patches that are distributed in a pattern along the lines of Blaschko. The condition usually occurs in the neonatal period or early infancy, as in this case, and typically involves the trunk and limbs. The vesicles tend not to be associated with any systemic symptoms, and while the hyperpigmentation is generally permanent, the condition is benign with no associated morbidity or mortality.

B: Eruptive xanthomas 

Explanation: Eruptive xanthomas are characterized by the presence of numerous small, reddish-yellow papules that often arise suddenly. They are usually found on the buttocks, shoulders, arms, and legs but can also appear in the axillae. The patient's mildly elevated triglyceride levels also support this diagnosis. The histopathological findings of foam cells and histiocytes are indicative of xanthomas. In contrast, axillary granular parakeratosis presents as hyperkeratotic plaques and not papules, acanthosis nigricans is typically associated with insulin resistance and appears as dark, velvety skin in body folds and creases, and xanthoma disseminatum presents with xanthomas that are typically disseminated over the body, including the face, which is not the case in this patient.

B: Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, a retrobulbar inflammation

Explanation: Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is an uncommon syndrome characterised by severe unilateral orbital or periorbital pain, ophthalmoplegia and occasionally, ipsilateral sympathetic dysfunction. The patient presented with symptoms compatible with this syndrome, including unilateral periorbital pain and swelling, red eye, and lack of other neurological defect or symptom. The absence of significant signs of other conditions such as cluster headaches (which would typically present with a regular onset and rapid end), the lack of symptoms related to nasopharyngeal space-occupying lesion like disturbances in smell or nasal obstruction, and not presenting any symptoms typical for acute angle-closure glaucoma such as blurred vision, halos around lights or eye pain aggravated by illumination, support the diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.

Without the figure or scan results it's impossible to give a definite answer. However, based on the information provided, one possible diagnosis could be C: Diabetic neuropathy. 

Explanation: Diabetic neuropathy can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain and numbness in the legs. This could align with the patient's complaints of pain radiating through her right leg. Additionally, her history of chronic constipation could potentially be related to autonomic neuropathy, another form of diabetic neuropathy. However, without more specific information from tests, it would be hard to rule out other possibilities definitively.

A: Fibrosis owing to chronic peptic ulceration. 

Explanation: The clinical presentation and the radiographic findings are consistent with gastric outlet obstruction due to fibrosis from chronic peptic ulceration. The absence of a detectable mass on CT scan and negative biopsy results make a diagnosis of duodenal carcinoma less likely. Duodenal web is typically a congenital condition and would be an unlikely diagnosis in a 72-year-old patient. Additionally, an annular pancreas usually presents early in life and is often associated with other anomalies, which were not noted in this patient. Peptic ulcer disease often leads to fibrosis and scarring that can cause gastric outlet obstruction.

1138
B

Explanation: The clinical presentation of the case suggests Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection, so initiating treatment with oral valacyclovir is appropriate. The eyelid lesion with ulceration, the foreign-body sensation, and the ipsilateral preauricular lymphadenopathy are typical signs of HSV infection. The absence of fever and the enlargement of lymph nodes are further indicators. Additionally, histopathology findings, including necrotic epithelium with multinucleated keratinocytes, also point towards a diagnosis of HSV infection. The patient would likely benefit from antiviral treatment with oral valacyclovir, which is used to treat HSV infections. This would address the primary cause of the condition rather than just managing the symptoms or attempting to remove the lesion surgically. Therefore, it would be appropriate to start treatment with oral valacyclovir (Option B) rather than proceed with other surgical options at this point.
C: Discontinue oral acyclovir and start topical trifluridine. 

Explanation: The diagnosis is herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Treatment is typically aimed at reducing ocular complications and hasten resolution of systemic symptoms. Oral antivirals such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir should be initiated immediately to decrease the severity and duration of acute illness and ocular complications. In this case, the patient had developed dendritic keratitis, which is a vision-threatening complications that may develop in HZO. It is commonly treated with topical antivirals like trifluridine solution or ganciclovir gel. It is also important to note that topical corticosteroids should only be used under the supervision of an ophthalmologist, as inappropriate use can lead to corneal scarring and perforation. Therefore, the best next step would be to switch the oral acyclovir to a topical antiviral medication, specifically trifluridine, while continuing oral antivirals. The rest of the options aren't necessary or recommended as initial steps in the management of this case.

B: Obtain aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction/culture/cytology 

Explanation: The lack of response to therapy could suggest an alternative or additional diagnosis. The patient's CD4 count is low, and he was treated prophylactically for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, suggesting that his risk of opportunistic infections is high. Obtaining aqueous and vitreous samples for PCR/culture/cytology could identify other infective organisms apart from CMV that maybe contributing to the symptoms. Adding steroids (Option A) might worsen an underlying infective condition. Intravitreous voriconazole injection (Option C) is more specific for fungal infections, and while it is possible that the patient has a fungal retinitis, this needs to be confirmed by diagnostic testing. Checking the serology results (Option D) would be useful, but direct testing of ocular fluids would provide a more definitive diagnosis. Therefore, option B is the next best step in the management of this patient.

B: Perform incisional biopsy of the left lacrimal gland

Explanation: Based on the patient’s clinical presentation, MRI findings, and incomplete response to high-dose steroids, a lacrimal gland mass leading to proptosis and ophthalmic symptoms should be considered. A definitive diagnosis will require an incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland. Whether the mass is benign or malignant, the specific diagnosis revealed by the biopsy will influence treatment. Other options would be less appropriate: a gallium scan would not provide specific enough information, antiviral therapy would be based on guesswork, and there’s not sufficient evidence to indicate increasing the prednisone dosage would be beneficial.

C: Black-spot poison ivy dermatitis.

Explanation: In this case, the patient's symptoms including the pruritic rash, black streaks on the skin, and the lack of improvement even after proper medication point towards Black-spot poison ivy dermatitis, also known as Rhus Dermatitis. This condition is caused by a reaction to urushiol, an oil found in the resin canals of plants such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. The black streaks on her skin are most likely due to the oxidization of the urushiol oil, which turns black upon contact with the air. This is usually not accompanied by systemic symptoms or fever and commonly presents as erythematous and pruritic streaks or patches where the plant came into contact with the skin. The severity depends on a person's sensitivity and the amount of urushiol oil they come into contact with. Though the patient does not recall any exposure to these plants, a lack of explicit contact does not exclude the diagnosis, as even indirect contact with pets or gardening tools can transfer the oil. It's important to note that the condition is not contagious and the eruption typically appears 10 to 14 days following initial exposure in a sensitized person, or within 48 hours in a previously sensitized individual.

C: Both lesions are ischemic and should have a stent placed.

Explanation: The FFR value, which is the ratio of the maximum flow in a stenotic artery to the theoretical maximum flow in a normal artery, is a commonly used index to determine the hemodynamic significance of a coronary stenosis. An FFR value less than 0.8 is considered hemodynamically significant and is usually an indication for revascularization. In the case presented, the overall FFR value of the ramus branch across both lesions is 0.43, suggesting that the combination of these lesions is contributing to significant flow limitation. Despite the higher FFR value (0.82) at the proximal lesion after pull-back, both lesions act in combination to limit flow in the ramus branch, therefore, both lesions should be considered for revascularization treatment such as stenting.

C: Osteosarcoma. 

Explanation: The accompanying histology of the patient's mass and the mix of signs such as multinucleated giant cells, atypical stromal cells, osteoid formation with fine calcifications, severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures, and osteoid-entrapped, malignant-appearing cells are highly indicative of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of malignant bone cancer, which originates from premature bone-forming cells and can appear in any bone in the body. The pattern of osteoid matrix production and cellular atypia pointed to the diagnosis. Furthermore, the presence of this condition in a young, post-radiation therapy patient adds up to the proper clinical context supporting this diagnosis.
C
1145
A: Chondroma

Explanation: The clinical history, imaging, and histology findings are all indicative of a nasal septum chondroma. Chondromas are generally benign tumors composed of cartilage cells, which is consistent with the near-complete resection of the quadrangular cartilage and resection of the adjacent anterior portion of the periosteum of the vomer bone in the septectomy. The internal matrix mineralization noted on the noncontrast CT bone window further supports this diagnosis. Other options like chondroblastoma, cavernous hemangioma, and low-grade chondrosarcoma may present a similar picture but are less likely considering the full clinical picture and histology of this case. For example, chondroblastomas are rare and usually occur in the long bones, cavernous hemangiomas are vascular tumors which would typically show a different picture on imaging, and low-grade chondrosarcomas would generally show more aggressive behavior and would not be entirely consistent with the histological findings and the fact the lesion was removable by septectomy.
C
1146
C: Chordoma

Explanation: A chordoma is a slow-growing tumor that is often found at the base of the skull and in the bones of the spine. The patient's symptoms including mouth breathing, snoring, and nasal obstruction with hyponasality and eustachian tube dysfunction, as well as transient upper extremity paraplegias, are consistent with a retropharyngeal lesion affecting the cervical spine at the atlantoaxial joint. Furthermore, the MRI reveals a recurrence and enlargement of the retropharyngeal mass with features such as erosion of the upper dens, anterior arch of C1, and the basion, which is typical in chordomas. Chordomas are often recurrent, which fits with this case where the patient previously had a benign retropharyngeal lesion that has now returned. Therefore, diagnosis option C: Chordoma is the most likely.
B
1147
A: Complicated acute otitis media

Explanation: The patient's symptoms combined with the CT and MRI findings suggest a diagnosis of complicated acute otitis media. The purulent discharge from the ear is typical of an infected ear, which could be caused by acute otitis media. The imaging results show involvement of the middle ear and mastoid, which are areas commonly affected by this condition. Additionally, the gadolinium-enhanced MRI showing meningitis and a large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement, in conjunction with ADC and DWI findings consistent with a cerebellar abscess, further validate the diagnosis. The cerebellar abscess may have developed as a complication from the acute otitis media, potentially due to direct extension of infection or hematogenous spread.
B
1148
B: Aneurysmal bone cyst. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging results are indicative of an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC). ABC is a benign, vascular lesion that rapidly expands and can cause bone destruction. It often occurs in the long bones and vertebrae but is rare in the petrous apex. The presence of a fluid-fluid level is a characteristic feature of ABC, which represents blood sedimentation. Also, rapid symptom progression and bone expansion involving the internal auditory canal are consistent with ABC. Additionally, ABCs can cause local mass effects leading to cranial neuropathies as seen in this case. Finally, complete resolution of symptoms following surgical resection supports the diagnosis of an ABC, which usually has a good prognosis post resection.

C: Primary lymphoma of bone 

Explanation: 
The patient presented with symptoms of progressively worsening bone pain, night sweats, and anemia suggestive of malignancy. Despite significant bone destruction observed on the X-ray, the CT scan did not visualize any metastasic disease or lymph node enlargement, and the bone scan did not show any other abnormalities other than increased uptake in the left femur. This suggests the presence of a primary bone tumor rather than metastatic disease. Among the options, Primary lymphoma of bone would be most consistent with these findings. Fibrosarcoma and solitary plasmacytoma of bone could also present in this manner, but these would be expected to show monoclonal protein on serum protein electrophoresis testing, which was negative in this case. Fibrous dysplasia typically doesn't lead to symptoms as severe as those presented by the patient, and associated bone destruction would be unusual. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is primary lymphoma of bone.

B

Explanation: Given the non-resolving nature of the rash despite broad antimicrobial therapy, the possibility of a deficiency state should be considered. The patient's entire intake has been parenterally administered for an extended period of time. Thus, the course of the disease could be attributable to some type of deficiency that has not been correctly supplemented, possibly related to his total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Notably, zinc deficiency can cause a rash and hair loss, a condition seen often in patients on long-term TPN, since zinc supplementation often goes overlooked. Therefore, obtaining trace element levels would be an appropriate next step to investigate this possibility. If the levels come back normal, other avenues such as skin biopsy or a paraneoplastic panel could be investigated. But given his specific circumstance, nutrient or trace element deficiency seems likely.
A: The patient has a low-normal serum erythropoietin level. She should be tested for JAK2V16F mutation status.

Explanation: The patient's low-normal erythropoietin level combined with the elevated hemoglobin level may suggest a form of myeloproliferative neoplasm such as polycythemia vera, which frequently involves a JAK2V617F mutation. The patient's symptoms of night sweats and excessive fatigue also align with common symptoms in individuals with this mutation and related disorders. Hence, it would be beneficial to pursue a test for the JAK2V16F mutation status to guide potential treatment.

B: Order urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and ECG findings suggest the presence of symptomatic bradycardia, most likely due to complete (third-degree) atrioventricular block. This is characterized by independent atrial and ventricular rates, broad QRS complex, and severe bradycardia, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output, resulting in hypotension, diminished responsiveness, or cardiac arrest. In this setting, the most critical immediate step is to restore reliable cardiac pacing. The best option would be to urgently place a temporary transvenous pacemaker. While interventions such as coronary angiogram or hemodialysis could be necessary depending on the clinical context, the most immediate life-threatening issue requiring intervention in this scenario is the patient's bradycardia from heart block. Similarly, although the patient is cold to touch, the primary cause of this is likely the severely reduced cardiac output, not hypothermia, so active rewarming would not address the primary problem.

B: IgG4-related skin disease. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation - erythematous papules and plaques on the cheeks, bilateral parotid gland swelling, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia - is consistent with IgG4-related skin disease. Crucially, the skin biopsy reveals the hallmark of IgG4-related disease: lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with IgG4-positive plasma cells. The lack of detectable anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies, which are typically associated with Sjögren syndrome, further strengthens the diagnosis of IgG4-related skin disease. The absence of symptoms and signs typically associated with sarcoidosis and cutaneous lymphoma, along with the biopsy findings, makes these diagnoses less likely.

C: Leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis

Explanation: The presented symptoms align with a diagnosis of leukemia cutis, which is the infiltration of leukemic blast cells into the skin from systemic lesions, occurring in 10-15% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The presence of leukemic vasculitis, wherein the vasculature is infiltrated by leukemic cells, is suggestive by tender, erythematous, purpuric, or necrotic papules and plaques. This is supported by the histopathologic findings and that the lesions appeared simultaneously with a blast crisis. Negative cultures and polymerase chain reaction studies rule out infectious etiologies, and the absence of systemic manifestations like septicemia, organ failure and thrombotic complications makes disseminated intravascular coagulation less probable. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis typically presents with palpable purpura, fever, and malaise. Cutaneous mucormycosis, a rare fungal infection, usually occurs in immunocompromised hosts, but is often associated with sinusitis, headache, and facial pain, which are not reported here.

1155
C: Phaeohyphomycosis

Explanation: The biopsy result depicts that the patient's lesion is a type of fungal infection characterized by the presence of pigmented spores and pseudohyphae, which point towards Phaeohyphomycosis. This medical condition is a group of mycotic infections caused by dematiaceous (pigmented) fungi, characterized by the presence of melanin in their cell walls. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's immunosuppressed state resulting from his lung transplant and end-stage kidney disease. The other options - Aspergillosis, Mucormycosis, and Chromoblastomycosis - are less likely as they present with different histological features that do not match the ones described in the case.

C: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including vision disturbances, severe headaches, and decreased bilateral hearing, suggests possible neurological implications. These symptoms could result from a neurological disorder, brain inflammation, or a vascular problem within the brain. While other tests may be helpful in providing a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be more immediately beneficial for diagnosing potential central nervous system disorders or detecting any abnormalities in the brain.

1157
C: Fluorescein angiography and workup for infectious and inflammatory etiologies.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms and findings on examination, further investigation is needed to identify a potential underlying cause. The appearance of the fundus, along with presence of keratic precipitates and vitreal cells, could suggest an inflammatory or infectious process. Fluorescein angiography can provide more detailed information about the ocular vasculature and help identify any abnormal areas leading to the symptoms. Additionally, a workup for infectious and inflammatory conditions can assist in determining if there is a systemic disease contributing to the ocular findings. Observation alone may miss a treatable underlying disorder while prescribing oral prednisone without an established diagnosis could potentially mask or exacerbate certain conditions. Cardiology consultation and hypercoagulability workup might be appropriate if there were other suggestive symptoms or findings, but they are not directly indicated based on the current case presentation.

B: Remove the foreign body with forceps. 

Explanation: From the symptoms and physical examination, it seems that the patient has a conjunctival foreign body. Foreign body sensation, tearing, and redness are the classic presentations of a foreign body in the eye. The hyperemia (or redness) could be a sign of local irritation or infection. The first step in managing this condition would be to remove the foreign body to relieve the symptoms and prevent further harm. Systemic and topical antibiotics may be necessary after the removal of the foreign body if there is a concern for infection. The skin lesions could be related to something he encountered on his hike and needs further evaluation. Notably, his wife's similar symptom indicates that these lesions might be because of an external cause, such as an insect bite. Excising the conjunctiva or performing a CT scan of the orbits seems excessive as initial management for this presentation.

B

Explanation: 
Given the medical history about the patient's weight-loss surgery, decreases in vitamin A absorption might have occurred, making this option the most viable. The duodenal switch surgery can lead to malabsorption that could result in several nutritional deficiencies including vitamin A. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining the health of the ocular surface and visual function, especially in low light situations, and a deficiency can lead to night blindness, conjunctival and corneal xerosis, and Bitot spots. Thus, the patient’s symptoms might be caused by a vitamin A deficiency, necessitating the evaluation of vitamin levels.
C: Jejunogastric intussusception

Explanation: In this case, the patient's history of previous gastric surgery combined with the current presentation of acute abdominal pain and vomiting suggest a diagnosis of jejunogastric intussusception. This is a rare but serious complication that can occur post gastric surgery and is strongly suggested by the sudden onset of symptoms and the imaging findings. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor and gastric bezoar often present with symptoms over a longer period, while gastric polyp with bleeding will usually show abnormalities in the initial blood tests. Moreover, an intra-gastric mass attached with a structure coming from the small bowel orifice, as seen in the CT image, is highly suggestive of intussusception. Therefore, the most fitting diagnosis given the patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings is jejunogastric intussusception.

1161
C: Primary hyperparathyroidism

Explanation: The patient's findings of facial and lower extremity edema, fatigue, anorexia, and impaired renal function are suggestive of nephrolithiasis-induced renal failure. The subsequent development of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia after removal of the urinary obstruction suggest a parathyroid-related disorder, most likely primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone, leading to elevated calcium levels in the blood. The increased calcium levels can lead to the formation of kidney stones. The condition may go unnoticed until nephrolithiasis induces renal failure, as seen in this case. Hypercalcemia tends to suppress appetite and can cause malaise, both of which the patient reported.

1162
D: PTH resistance

Explanation: The clinical findings and lab results for this patient suggest PTH resistance, more specifically pseudohypoparathyroidism. This disorder is associated with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, increased PTH levels, and characteristic physical features. This condition is characterized by an abnormally high level of parathyroid hormone in the blood, as the body inaccurately perceives low levels of calcium. In this case, the parathyroid hormone is not able to fully perform its functions due to a resistance, hence why it is called PTH resistance. This can be related to genetic causes, often inherited. The patient's exclusive diet of orange soda, meat, and chili has likely contributed to his condition as it lacks in essential nutrients. His wrists being unusually wide, suggests a condition known as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (common with pseudohypoparathyroidism). Despite aggressive calcium replacement, the patient's calcium levels remained low, which further supports a diagnosis of PTH resistance.

1163
A: Acute viral pericarditis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever and chest discomfort along with the ECG findings of diffuse ST-segment elevation are consistent with acute pericarditis. Inflammation of the pericardial sac can cause these changes on ECG. The absence of significant changes in cardiac enzyme levels further signifies that myocardial infarction (option B) is less likely. Acute aortic dissection (option C) usually presents with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, which is not mentioned in the case. Pericardial tumor (option D) is less probable based on the presented symptoms and their sudden onset. Furthermore, leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein levels suggest an inflammatory process, which is consistent with viral pericarditis.

1164
C: Gardner syndrome. 

Explanation: This patient's presentation of multiple osteomas, including a large sinus osteoma leading to frontal sinus opacification and epidural abscess, along with a positive family history, matches Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is characterized by multiple colon polyps, and these patients are at a high risk for colon cancer. The identifying feature of Gardner syndrome compared with classic FAP is the presence of benign extra-colonic manifestations, which can include osteomas (often in the skull or jaw), dental abnormalities, and soft tissue tumors. Mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene (5q21), as seen in this patient, are responsible for both FAP and Gardner syndrome. Gorlin syndrome typically presents with multiple basal cell carcinomas and jaw cyst, and Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder affecting females, characterized by short stature and infertility. Turcot syndrome is an association of primary brain tumors and colon polyps.
C
1165
B: Laryngeal neurofibroma

Explanation: The clinical presentation of the patient, along with the pathology finding of a positive S100 protein immunostain, suggest a neural origin of the mass. The S100 protein is a sensitive marker for cells derived from the neural crest, and is commonly seen in neurofibromas and schwannomas. However, the absence of vocal cord paralysis and the location of the lesion in the aryepiglottic fold are more suggestive of a neurofibroma than a schwannoma. A paraganglioma would typically demonstrate a hypervascular mass on imaging which is not described here. Lastly, a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma would typically reveal leukoplakia in the laryngoscopy and the patient's smoking history could be a risk factor, but the positive S100 stain is not consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a laryngeal neurofibroma.
C
1166
C: Primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis

Explanation: The findings of the case suggest primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis. The disease is a rare form of localized amyloidosis. It impacts the larynx and lower respiratory tract and can lead to airway obstruction. Characteristics include nodular deposits of amyloid, which is an eosinophilic, homogeneous, and amorphous protein substance. The diagnosis is supported by the mucosal deposition of amyloid seen in biopsy specimens, presenting as amorphous, eosinophilic material with evidence of calcification, metaplastic ossification, and multinucleated foreign-body giant cells. While the other options can present with similar symptoms, their histological findings would not include the same amorphous, eosinophilic material seen in this patient's biopsy samples.
C
1167
D: Reaction to radiotherapy. 

Explanation: This case showcases symptoms that are indicative of a radiation-induced condition. Eosinophilic, Polymorphic, and Pruritic Eruption Associated With Radiotherapy (EPPER) typically commences after a period of 1-4 months following radiotherapy and exclusively affects area of skin that have been irradiated. Eruptions can range from mild to severe and often present as papules, plaques, or pustules as detailed in the case. Other options can be ruled out as bacterial folliculitis and Pityrosporum folliculitis generally do not show a direct relation to radiation. The mention of a cold sore or herpes from years ago is not necessarily relevant as herpes outbreaks typically recur in the same location where the virus was first acquired.

B: Myeloid sarcoma

Explanation: Myeloid sarcoma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma, is a localized tumor composed of myeloid blasts or immature myeloid cells occurring in an extramedullary site. It can occur in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloproliferative disease or myelodysplastic syndromes(MDS) like in this patient's case. The presentation of this patient with MDS developing an intraoral mass is suggestive of myeloid sarcoma. Although it's a rare occurrence, its presentation in MDS patients has been previously documented in literature. In addition to his history, the worsening cytopenias further support this diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma, invasive aspergilloma, and condyloma acuminatum can present as oral masses, but they are less likely given the patient’s hematologic history and the absence of common risk factors for these conditions.

B

Explanation: This patient’s expanding annular skin lesion with central clearing (also known as erythema migrans), history of living in a Lyme disease–endemic region, and positive serologic testing establish the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Erythema migrans is the most common manifestation of Lyme disease. Other systemic signs can include headache, fever, and malaise, but these are not required for diagnosis. Successful treatment of Lyme disease is most often achieved with appropriate antibiotic therapy, and improvement of symptoms following treatment suggests eradication of the infection, as in this patient. Routine follow-up serologic testing after treatment is not recommended because patients who are treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics may remain seropositive despite successful therapy. In patients with complicated or treatment-refractory Lyme disease, consultation with an infectious disease specialist may be beneficial. Therefore, this patient should complete her antibiotic treatment without further testing, option B.
B: Obtain serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. 

Explanation: This patient has pancytopenia in the setting of hypothyroidism, anemia with microcytes and macrocytes, and bone marrow changes consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis. This clinical presentation is suggestive of a disorder in DNA synthesis, which is seen in B12 and folate deficiency. Despite the elevated B12 and folate levels in this patient, there should be suspicion for functional B12 deficiency. This scenario can occur in certain disorders, such as nitrous oxide abuse, inherited disorders of vitamin B12 transport (eg, transcobalamin deficiency), or certain drugs (eg, antacid), where there is adequate consumption of vitamin B12 but its conversion to its active forms is inhibited. This patient's presentation is suggestive of functional B12 deficiency, which can be determined by elevated levels of MMA and homocysteine (another metabolic byproduct of the pathways that use B12). Therefore, checking serum MMA level is the most appropriate next step. Both MMA and homocysteine levels are often elevated in B12 deficiency, but MMA is more specific for B12 deficiency as homocysteine level can also be elevated in folate deficiency.

B: Obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation; monitor for multiorgan damage.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with cholesterol emboli, or atheroembolism, a rare condition where cholesterol crystals break loose from atherosclerotic plaques and occlude small arteries. This condition often presents with blue or purple discoloration of the extremities (blue toe syndrome) and is often triggered by vascular procedures such as coronary angiography or bypass surgery that the patient has recently undergone. Given the multiorgan involvement suggested by the acute kidney injury, it is essential to monitor other organ systems for damage and do further evaluations like liver function tests and ophthalmologic examination as it can precipitate in almost any organ system. Immediate thrombolytic therapy or surgical intervention may not be the first step given the potential of provoking additional plaque fragmentation and embolization. It is necessary to involve a multidisciplinary team in the management of such a patient.

D: Alkaptonuria. 

Explanation: Alkaptonuria is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the way the body processes a protein called phenylalanine. Patients with Alkaptonuria are unable to completely break down two amino acids (aliphatic amino acids). This disease is characterized by a triad of darkening urine, dark ochronotic pigmentation of the cartilage, and arthritis. The dark pigmentation mentioned in the case; the patient's history of dark discolored diapers as an infant; and symptoms consistent with ochronotic arthropathy – these clues point to Alkaptonuria. Argyria (A) typically affects areas of skin exposed to the sun and not the ears, acute intermittent porphyria (B) is linked with neurological symptoms and not the described pigmentation, and diffuse melanosis in metastatic melanoma (C) could present with wide spread skin pigmentation but it does not account for the urine discoloration as an infant.

D: Congenital cutaneous candidiasis. 

Explanation: Congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC) is a rare infection that occurs in neonates at birth or within the first 6 days of life, caused by Candida sp. CCC is often characterized by a widespread eruption of micropustules or erythematous macules; largely distributed on the trunk and extremities, sparing the palms, soles, and mucous membranes which is consistent with the symptoms noted for the neonate. Presence of yeast forms on lesional scrapings of the skin further suggests CCC. Though erythema toxicum neonatorum presents similarly, it rarely occurs in preterm infants born before 38 weeks' gestation. The diagnosis of CCC is confirmed by histopathological examination and culture of skin lesions. This differs from neonatal candidiasis, which is a systemic infection, and may present with symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory distress, and septicemia. Congenital dermatophytosis generally presents with more scaly and hyperkeratotic lesions.

C: Classic Dowling-Degos disease

Explanation: The features depicted in the case better align with Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), a rare form of reticulate hyperpigmentation. DDD typically becomes noticeable in adulthood, frequently demonstrating a slow, progressive course. It is marked by reticulate hyperpigmentation affecting flexural areas, primarily the neck, axillae, and groin, albeit other areas, including the face, torso, and limbs, can also be affected. The presence of hyperkeratotic papules is indicative of Galli-Galli disease, a variant involving a mutation in the keratin 5 gene, which is also seen in DDD. Histopathology reveals elongated rete ridges with upward proliferation of pigmented slender antler-like rete ridges along with scattered thin suprapapillary plates, as seen in this case. Of the listed options, only Galli-Galli disease and Dowling-Degos disease demonstrate reticulate pigmentation. However, the absence of acantholysis excludes Galli-Galli disease, leaving classic Dowling-Degos disease as the most likely diagnosis.

D: Pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and capsule.

Explanation: This case represents chronic pseudophakic endophthalmitis, a rare but difficult to manage condition. Given the recurrence of inflammation, intraocular lens (IOL)- or capsule-associated infection should be considered, despite negative cultures. This possibility, along with the limitation of further intravitreal injections (which have inherent risks and had only transient effects previously), point toward the removal of the possible infection source and clearance of opacities with vitrectomy. This option might permit better visualization for posterior segment pathologies and better access for injectable medications, if needed. Restarting topical medication may not offer the sufficient intraocular concentration to treat the condition, and increased systemic exposure could elevate the risk for systemic side effects. The persistent inflammation despite aggressive inflammatory treatment also decreases the likely benefit of additional intravitreal or posterior sub-Tenon steroid injections.

A: Apply digital pressure over the plate to dislodge the obstruction.

Explanation: Based on the presentation and the select choices, this seems to be the most immediately appropriate response. To begin with, an obstruction in the Baerveldt drainage implant could be at fault for the increased intraocular pressure. As such, trying to dislodge it (option A) may help to rapidly lower the IOP and provide immediate relief to the patient. The other three option may be applicable depending on other factors such as how severe the obstruction is, whether it is movable and whether there are other structural issues contributing to the increased IOP. However, given that the patient has had the implant for a while and the sudden increase in IOP, it seems more likely this could be related to a displaceable obstruction - hence option A is the most appropriate. This would also be the least invasive and potentially quickest option to help the patient's discomfort. Of course, all of this would be done in close consultation with Ophthalmologists.

B

Explanation: The clinical presentation (night blindness, retinal pigmentary changes, and foveoschisis) and results from imaging tests (hyperautofluorescence and thinning of the outer retina with interruptions in the ellipsoid zone) are indicative of a condition related to defective photoreceptor function. This condition is most likely autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, which could be associated with a mutation in the NR2E3 gene. Therefore, referring the patient for genetic counseling and potential testing for this mutation (option B) is the best next step. The other options (A: Perform an intravitreous injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor, C: Order testing for antirecoverin antibodies, and D: Perform a vitreous biopsy) are less likely to be helpful based on the features of this case. The condition does not appear to involve blood vessels, autoimmune retinopathy, or intraocular inflammation, respectively, which are the conditions these options are generally used to diagnose or treat.

B: Obtain neuroimaging of the brain and orbits.

Explanation: Given the patient's systemic symptoms (fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, and weight loss) in combination with the ocular findings, it is crucial to rule out a central nervous system or orbital disorder that might be causing his symptoms. Neuroimaging of the brain and orbits can help identify or rule out conditions such as inflammation, infection, tumor, or vascular disorders, which are not identifiable through the ocular examination and imaging findings alone. In this case, the patient's presentation is atypical for common causes of macular edema, such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion, which is why additional imaging of the brain and orbits is necessary.

C: Fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid artery. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging workup are suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid artery. This is a disorder characterized by narrowing and dilatation of medium-to-large sized arteries including the carotid artery, leading to decrease in blood flow and thus, causing neurological symptoms. The absence of common risk factors for atherosclerosis like smoking, hypertension and abnormal lipid profile makes carotid atherosclerosis an unlikely diagnosis. The 'string sign' seen on her cerebral arteriogram is a hallmark of fibromuscular dysplasia, not carotid artery dissection or aneurysm. Furthermore, her symptoms of intermittent discoordination and paresthesia in her right limbs signify an abnormality in her left cerebral circulation, corresponding to the left carotid artery finding.

D: Neisseria meningitidis.

Explanation: Neisseria meningitidis typically presents with rash, fever, and signs of meningitis. It can also cause severe invasive diseases such as meningococcal sepsis and meningitis, both of which can be fatal if not treated promptly. Neisseria meningitidis is the only bacterium that can cause a rapidly progressing petechial rash, which can then change to purpuric. It is also one of the main causes of septic shock in children. However, this case presentation seems to be more consistent with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, which is characterized by adrenal gland failure due to bleeding induced by severe bacterial infection, most commonly the meningococcus Neisseria meningitidis. Rapid clinical deterioration and septic shock, along with positive rash characteristics, heightened C-reactive protein levels, and relative thrombocytosis present in this case, seems to match more with a Neisseria meningitidis infection.

A: Map and ablate the epicardium

Explanation: Given the lack of structural abnormalities detected and the continuing persistent tachycardia despite administration of a beta blocker (sotalol), an electrophysiological approach to directly target the region of the epicardial surface of the left ventricular apex, suggested as the origin of tachycardia, can be a promising solution. Ablation of the region would ideally disrupt the abnormal electrical pathway causing the recurrent palpitations. Other options are overall less immediate or potentially unnecessary such as the implantation of a defibrillator without the confirmation of functional electrical disturbances in need of pacing or shocking.

B: Fibrous dysplasia. 

Explanation: The man's symptoms, along with the imaging findings, are suggestive of fibrous dysplasia, a bone disorder in which a fibrous tissue develops in place of normal bone leading to weak, deformed bone tissues. This diagnosis is largely based on the CT imaging, which shows a ground-glass appearance. Paget's disease often shows a "cotton wool" appearance on imaging; Otosclerosis usually involves the stapes and presents as conductive hearing loss, and Exostosis generally refers to benign, slow-growing bony projections, usually caused by cold water exposure, thus unlikely in this case. It's key to remember that fibrous dysplasia can be monostotic or polyostotic, affecting a single bone or multiple bones, respectively.

1183
A: Angiosarcoma

Explanation: The clinical history, imaging, surgical findings, and especially the histopathologic evaluation revealing pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, increased mitotic activity, evidence of angiogenesis, and strong membrane reactivity for CD31, which confirms an endothelial origin of the lesion, is consistent with a diagnosis of Angiosarcoma. This is a rare malignant vascular tumor that originates from endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. Thyroid angiosarcoma is extremely rare, but can be associated with rapid tumor growth, which is consistent with this patient's presentation. Multinodular goiter, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and hemangioma don't typically include these findings.
A
1184
C: Laryngeal candidiasis

Explanation: The woman's chief symptom of hoarseness over several years without other symptoms like shortness of breath, gastric reflux, smoking, cough, dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, or chills suggests a non-malignant cause. Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by the Candida species and could lead to changes in the voice. Laryngeal candidiasis is typically characterized by white plaques or lesions on the vocal folds, consistent with the findings of a white lesion in the described case. Also, the absence of significant past medical history further supports the likelihood of a non-malignant, treatable condition like candidiasis. Lastly, the histopathologic images as described might show hyphae and yeast forms characteristic of Candida species. Therefore, given the clinical presentation and examination findings, Laryngeal candidiasis seems to be the most probable diagnosis.
B
1185
A: Thymoma

Explanation: Anterior mediastinal masses are commonly caused by four types of lesions: thymoma, teratoma, lymphoma, and substernal goiter. In this case, the patient's symptoms of orthopnea suggest a mediastinal mass impinging on the trachea or great vessels. The presence of this symptom alongside relatively asymptomatic presentation points toward thymoma. Although teratoma, lymphoma, and substernal goiter can cause an anterior mediastinal mass, they often present with additional symptoms not present in this patient - for instance lymphoma generally results in systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, teratoma often results in symptoms due to rupture or infection, and substernal goiter would typically cause significant thyromegaly which was not observed in this case. Lastly, thymomas are more common in middle-aged patients such as the one described. Hence, diagnosis A: Thymoma is more likely.

1186
C: Radiation-induced myositis

Explanation: Given the timing and location of the pain, as well as the history of radiotherapy, radiation-induced myositis is a plausible diagnosis. This condition can occur as a result of radiation toxicity, which can cause inflammation and damage to the muscles within the radiation field. The right shoulder and arm are within the field of radiation administered for the right upper lobe tumor. The fact that the patient's pain location aligns with the irradiated area and started within a few months after the completion of radiation therapy further supports this diagnosis. The lack of additional systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or fatigue and of additional findings on the imaging makes the options of metastatic cancer and polymyalgia rheumatica less likely. Rib fracture is also less likely due to the absence of any trauma or physical strain.

A: The patient has ERBB2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer. 

Explanation: The ERBB2 (HER2) status is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and is scored on a scale of 0 to 3+. In this case, the score is 1+, which is considered negative for HER2 protein overexpression. Therefore, the correct interpretation of these test results is that the patient has ERBB2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer.

C: Obtain a skin biopsy from the upper back.

Explanation: In this patient with neck stiffness, decreased range of motion, and woody induration and thickening of the skin on the neck and upper back, the diagnosis is likely scleromyxedema, a rare dermatologic condition associated with monoclonal gammopathy. Very few conditions cause skin induration, which include scleroderma, eosinophilic fasciitis, chronic graft-vs-host disease, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and scleromyxedema. Patients with scleromyxedema have systemic illnesses including diabetes (as seen in this patient), and it may also have presenting features such as facial, periorbital edema and thickening of the skin overlying the extensor surfaces of joints. Thus, a skin biopsy is needed for confirmation.

C: Petrified ear

Explanation: The patient's history and laboratory data show a pattern of chronic renal disease which may lead to disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism that can result in metastatic calcification in soft tissues. Petrified ear, or ossification/calcification of the auricular cartilage, is a rare condition often associated with renal disease or trauma. In this case, the patient's history of increased rigidity in his ears, with no reported decrease in auditory acuity or history of trauma, along with confirmed ossification from the biopsy and CT scans, are indicative of petrified ear.

B: Lucio phenomenon

Explanation: The clinical feature of this case, including the absence of fever, joint pains, or epistaxis, the presence of numbness and thickening of nerves, ulceration and eschar formation, bizarre purpuric and necrotic plaques, hypoesthesia, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and madarosis strongly suggest a diagnosis of Lucio phenomenon. This is a rare and severe form of leprosy reaction seen in diffuse lepromatous leprosy also known as Lucio’s leprosy. It is characterized by the sudden onset of painful erythematous acral lesions that evolve into necrotic and ulcerated plaques, often occurring in patients with no prior history of leprosy. The histopathological findings also support this diagnosis. The other options like erythema nodosum leprosum, cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa despite having similar presentations, they don't match completely with the presented symptoms, signs, and histopathological image in this case.

C: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis

Explanation: Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by symmetrical, polyarticular nodules and erosive arthritis. It is more commonly seen in women aged 40–50 years. The skin findings typically develop concomitantly or precede onset of joint symptoms. It starts as a bright red macule that later forms nodules. Although the hallmark are red-brown or violaceous nodules on the hands, the disease can also involve the face, neck, trunk, and lower extremities. Pruritus, burning sensation and tenderness can occur. The etiology of MRH is unknown but it has been shown to possibly have an association with malignancies as well as autoimmune diseases. A correct diagnosis is based on a biopsy showing characteristic histological features.

A: Primary central nervous system lymphoma–leptomeningeal variant 

Explanation: This patient's progressive cranial neuropathies and lumbosacral radiculopathies, along with cerebral, cerebellar, and spinal cord leptomeningeal enhancement, suggests a disease affecting the meninges collectively known as leptomeningitis. Among the possible diagnoses presented, primary central nervous system lymphoma - leptomeningeal variant fits the patient's clinical scenario. High protein, low glucose, and lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can frequently be seen in primary CNS lymphoma. Furthermore, it has long been recognized to display leptomeningeal spread, including along cranial nerves and nerve roots, as in this patient. Despite the patient's smoking history, carcinomatous meningitis – primary adenocarcinoma of the lung is less likely as no pulmonary lesion was identified on thorough imaging, including PET-CT. Tuberculous meningitis could present similarly but is less likely in the absence of risk factors and a negative CSF assay for tuberculosis. Neurosarcoidosis is also less likely, given the absence of systemic symptoms, the marked lymphocytic predominance in the CSF, and relatively normal serum ACE levels.

A: Observe; follow up in 4 to 6 weeks with SD-OCT. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and ocular findings are consistent with post-viral exudative macular detachment, a condition typically associated with a prior viral illness and rash. It is generally a self-limiting condition, and the retinal lesions usually resolve without treatment, hence the choice to observe and follow-up in 4-6 weeks with SD-OCT. Although corticosteroids, photodynamic therapy, or anti-VEGF injections can be considered for the treatment of persistent or severe cases, their use would require more compelling evidence of a progressive or treatment-responsive disease process than is apparent here.

B: Biopsy. 

Explanation: Given the asymptomatic nature of the intraocular mass and the absence of any evident distress or discomfort to the patient, immediate invasive treatment like Brachytherapy may not be necessary at this stage. Observation might be useful but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasound biomicroscopy wouldn't provide additional beneficial information in this case as ultrasonography has already been conducted showing a large cyst in the peripheral retina of the left eye. Therefore, a biopsy might be the most suitable next step as it would allow for a closer examination and a definitive pathological determination of the nature of the mass, helping to inform further treatment strategies and follow-up procedures. This approach would help ensure that any required treatment is accurately targeted and potentially minimally invasive. Please note that this recommendation would also largely depend on the patient's preferences and overall health status. Collaboration with an oncologist specialised in ocular tumours could provide further guidance in this case.

D: Digital subtraction angiography with embolization of carotid cavernous fistula. 

Explanation: This case describes features of a pulsatile proptotic eye with a dilated superior ophthalmic vein, intraocular pressure that does not respond to treatment, pathologically cupped optic disc, and enlarged superior orbital fissure, which are suggestive of a carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF). This occurs when there is abnormal communication between the high pressure carotid arterial system and the low pressure cavernous sinus that can lead to high pressure changes in the eye manifesting as secondary open-angle glaucoma.

Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of CCF, allowing definitive localization and classification of the fistula. Endovascular embolization is considered the first line of treatment for indirect CCF (as seems to be the case here), which involves the placement of coils or other substances into the cavernous sinus to occlude the fistula. Surgical plugging of the CCF with a muscle patch may be considered if embolization fails or is not possible. Conservative management alone is typically inadequate given the high intraocular pressure and vision-threatening complications, and a trabeculectomy or drainage procedure would not address the underlying CCF.

C: Ischemic stroke

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is very consistent with an ischemic stroke. His dysarthria, right-sided hand and face weakness, right-sided hyper-reflexivity, and ability to comprehend and respond to commands, albeit nonverbally, suggest a possible left middle cerebral artery stroke. Moreover, his postoperative state might have made him more susceptible to developing an ischemic stroke by causing a hypercoagulable state. His improved alertness following naloxone can be likely due to the reversal of opioid-induced stupor instead of serving as a diagnostic clue. An MRI of the brain would likely confirm the diagnosis.

B: Intraductal papilloma 

Explanation: The woman's presentation, imaging findings, cell histology, and especially the well-differentiated papillary neoplasm with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and negative immunostains for TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin are all consistent with an intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papillomas are benign salivary gland neoplasms, often involving minor salivary glands of the oral cavity, particularly the lip and the buccal mucosa. Other options such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass, but the cytological characteristics do not match. Warthin tumor is primarily found in the parotid gland and in males who smoke. Acinic cell carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland neoplasm, usually present in the parotid gland. Hence, based on the information provided, the most appropriate diagnosis would be Intraductal papilloma.

A: Complications of otitis media

Explanation: The symptoms described - a history of otitis media, a bulging, hyperemic tympanic membrane, and fullness of the postauricular, upper cervical region - point towards complications of otitis media. However, it is essential for the diagnosing physician to rule out other conditions such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, which would require different treatments. An autism diagnosis does not directly influence this medical condition, but it may complicate communication about symptoms and pain level. Regular monitoring and timely intervention can prevent or manage complications arising from otitis media effectively.

1199
D: Middle ear adenoma. 

Explanation: The key clinical feature was the long-standing discharge with associated hearing loss and dizziness, which is typical for chronic otitis media with mastoid destruction; however, the presence of a soft tissue mass in this setting is suggestive of a neoplastic process. The histopathology is in keeping with a benign epithelial neoplasm, highlighting an intact layer of cuboidal epithelial cells which were positively stained for CK7, a characteristic marker of middle ear adenomas. The insignificant Ki-67 index suggests a very low proliferation rate, supporting the benign nature of the tumor. Middle Ear Adenoma, although a very rare entity, fits better with the given clinical and histopathological features compared to other choices.
A
1200
B: Isolated anosmia 

Explanation: The teenager girl's primary symptoms namely inability to detect subtle smells, her ability to detect strong odors, and her failure with the Penn smell tests suggest Isolated anosmia. Isolated Anosmia is a condition characterized by a loss of smell. This condition can occur due to several factors such as nasal congestion from a cold, allergy, sinus infection, or poor air quality. Furthermore, the absence of olfactory sulci and minimal tissue in bilateral olfactory grooves as seen on the MRI of the anterior skull base concretely points towards this diagnosis. This condition can be congenital or acquired. It is often difficult to pinpoint its cause unless it can be clearly related to a head injury or upper respiratory infection. Other options such as cerebrospinal fluid leak and sarcoidosis would present with other significant symptoms which are not present in this case. And while upper respiratory infection can cause transient loss of smell, it does not fit with the prolonged duration of her symptoms in this case.
B
1201
B: Branchial cleft fistula

Explanation: The patient's imaging studies and clinical history support the diagnosis of a second branchial cleft fistula. These are congenital lesions that manifest in the neck, they usually present as recurrent infections or draining sinuses on the lateral neck. This type of fistula forms a tract that extends to the skin from either the pharyngeal tonsillar fossa or the supra-tonsillar fossa leading to a mid-neck orifice anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient's symptoms, the location of the opening, and the failure of previous surgical resections which could cause a non-healing surgical tract, all point towards diagnosis option B. Thyroglossal duct fistula and Nocardia infection do not typically present in this manner.
A
1202
A: Middle aortic syndrome

Explanation: Middle aortic syndrome is characterized by the narrowing of the distal thoracic and/or abdominal aorta, commonly extending to involve the renal and visceral arteries. Symptoms often include hypertension, lower extremity claudication, or abdominal pain. In this patient, the symptoms of lower extremity claudication and the findings of weak femoral and absent pedal pulses, along with the MRA findings of an abnormal-appearing infrarenal segment, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Moreover, the increased ESR level could be indicative of an inflammatory response associated with aortic narrowing, despite the lack of positive blood and urine cultures. The location of stenosis on MRA also aligns with common locations for stenosis in middle aortic syndrome.

C: Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma

Explanation: Given the patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, he is at high risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The sudden hemorrhage, the size of the liver mass, and its enhancement pattern all make a ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma the most likely diagnosis. The active contrast extravasation originating from the right hepatic artery and the subsequent hemodynamic stability after embolization also support this diagnosis. The other options, including a ruptured giant cavernous hemangioma and a ruptured complex cystic liver mass, are less likely given this patient's background and the presentation described. Spontaneous liver bleeding is unlikely, as it typically does not present with a large mass.

A.
Explanation: CARD11 mutations have been associated with resistance to ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. BTK is essential for the survival and proliferation of B cells, a type of white blood cell that mutates and grows uncontrollably in CLL. CARD11 indirectly leads to BTK activation and if CARD11 is mutated, it could lead to BTK being constantly active, even in the presence of ibrutinib. Therefore, ibrutinib would not be effective in treating this patient's CLL and alternative treatment options should be considered.
A

Explanation: This patient's longstanding metabolic syndrome, poor hypertension control, and history of blurry vision are concerning for microvascular complications, potentially diabetic retinopathy. Given his obesity and elevated blood pressure, it is crucial to rule out diabetes in this patient so an hemoglobin A1c level should be ordered. Additionally, uncontrolled hypertension can also lead to retinopathy. Thus, both these conditions, if present, would need to be managed to prevent further damage. Hypercoagulable disorders (Choice B) are not typically related to blurry vision. A carotid ultrasound (Choice C) may diagnose carotid stenosis, but this patient's symptoms are not consistent with transient ischemic attacks or stroke. An MRI of the brain (Choice D) would be unnecessary at this time as this patient's presentation is most compatible with a systemic process, such as hypertension or diabetes, rather than a localized brain lesion.
A: The elevated testosterone level is consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms combined with the laboratory results point towards a diagnosis of PCOS. The excessive facial and abdominal hair growth, acne, weight gain, and the disruption in the menstrual cycle are all common symptoms of PCOS. Also, the elevated testosterone level present in the laboratory findings is a potential indicator of PCOS. Although the normal luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio can cast doubt on the diagnosis of PCOS, this ratio can still be normal in some women with PCOS and thus does not definitively exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis of PCOS does need documentation of polycystic ovaries by ultrasonography. Yet, elevated androgen levels, in this case testosterone, and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism can be enough to consider PCOS as a possibility pending further investigation. Hence, the answer is A.

A: Drug-induced hyperkalemia

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness and the lab results suggesting hyperkalemia, combined with his taking the medications lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic, suggest a case of drug-induced hyperkalemia. These medications can cause the body to retain potassium leading to hyperkalemia, especially in a patient with compromised kidney function, like in this case where the patient has chronic kidney disease. So, the patient's symptoms, medication list, and lab results all point towards drug-induced hyperkalemia.

B: Bullous amyloidosis. 

Explanation: The extensive purpuric, ulcerative, and bullous eruption, macroglossia, and observed amyloid are indicative of Bullous amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrous amyloid proteins. Bullous amyloidosis is a rare form that could occur in a patient with multiple myeloma, as in this case. It presents with fragility, purpura, and blister formation. The macroglossia and peripheral neuropathy further supports the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Therefore, despite the unusual blistering presentation, the overall clinical and histological findings are suggestive of bullous amyloidosis.

C: Granulomatous cheilitis

Explanation: Granulomatous cheilitis, also known as Miescher cheilitis, is characterized by persistent, nontender swelling of one or both lips. It is a rare inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology. Biopsy findings are typically characterized by non-caseating granulomas and mixed inflammatory infiltrate, as described in this patient. Oral sarcoidosis and Crohn disease can indeed present with oral lesions. However, sarcoidosis usually presents with other systemic symptoms (which this patient denied) and Crohn disease would typically show non-caseating granulomas as well. Postherpetic granulomatous reaction, on the other hand, occurs following herpes zoster infection, and there is no mention of such an infectious event. Thus, in the clinical context provided, the most fitting diagnosis is granulomatous cheilitis.

B: Muir-Torre syndrome

Explanation: The patient's rapidly growing nodule, along with the presence of several smaller papules on her face and neck, and her family history of cancer, are highly suggestive of Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS). MTS is a rare genetic condition characterized by the occurrence of sebaceous skin lesions and internal malignancies. This syndrome is a variant of Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The skin tumors in MTS frequently precede the onset of internal malignancies. It's important to note that internal cancers associated with MTS can be very aggressive, hence the mention of male family members dying of cancer in their fourth decade of life. However, genetic testing is necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

C

Explanation: Given the multisystemic involvement (optic neuropathy, alopecia, gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, and encephalopathy) and the patient's age, one must consider acquired (toxic or nutritional) causes of these findings. The finding of bilateral central scotomas is suggestive of toxic or nutritional optic neuropathy, while the peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal symptoms also support these differential diagnoses. Vitamin B12 deficiency can produce a similar constellation of findings, but is less likely given the normal complete blood count and lack of megaloblastic anemia. Nevertheless, it should still be considered in the differential diagnosis. Smoking history is also important as tobacco contains cyanide, which can cause visual loss from a toxic optic neuropathy. For these reasons, the next step should be option C: Check vitamin B12 levels and ask about smoking history.

C: Refer for rheumatologic workup.

Explanation: The clinical picture and laboratory findings are suggestive of an autoimmune disease. The presence of multiple cotton-wool spots scattered around the optic disc, without any evidence of vasculitis or occlusion on fluorescein angiography, combined with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, and a positive antinuclear antibody test all point to a systemic rheumatic disease. This would warrant rheumatological workup. His mild hypertension is being managed with lisinopril and his vision issue is not improving with it, therefore, ruling out option B. Temporal artery biopsy may be unnecessary at this point due to absence of jaw claudication or other typical symptoms of giant cell arteritis (option A), and observation without providing some form of treatment may not be in the best interest of the patient (option D). Therefore, a rheumatologic workup seems to be the most appropriate next step in managing the patient.

D. Given the patient’s recent development of cutaneous signs, painful oral lesions, and acute kidney injury (AKI), a skin biopsy for immunofluorescence is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for a potential diagnosis of an autoimmune bullous disorder. This cluster of diseases is characterized by autoantibodies that target elements of skin and mucous membranes, leading to acantholysis and blister formation. Bullous pemphigoid (BP), the most common autoimmune bullous disorder, often presents in elderly patients with pruritic, tense bullae on the skin. Although oral involvement is uncommon in BP, mucous membranes are frequently involved in other bullous diseases, such as pemphigus vulgaris and paraneoplastic pemphigus. AKI in the setting of a suspected autoimmune bullous disorder prompts further consideration of linear IgA bullous dermatosis and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease (Goodpasture syndrome). However, the absence of pulmonary findings, hematuria, and dysmorphic red cells makes anti-GBM disease less likely.
B: Cutaneous fungal infection. 

Explanation: Given the results of the biopsy sample demonstrating 'branching and septate hyphae within the superficial dermis,' the diagnosis would be pointing towards a cutaneous fungal infection. The presence of fungal elements in the superficial dermis is indicative of a fungal infection rather than pressure ulcer, neonatal lupus erythematosus or ecthyma gangrenosum. Furthermore, the premature neonate's state of immuno-compromise due to prematurity, intubation, and parenteral nutrition may have predisposed him to a fungal infection.

B: Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. 

Explanation: The clinical features and imaging studies point to lymphadenopathy and the presence of an extracardiac mass near the left atrium. Hodgkin lymphoma is a possible cause for these findings, especially considering the presence of hepatomegaly and splenic lesions. Furthermore, the elevated total serum bilirubin level with a direct component, in conjunction with jaundice and pruritus, may suggest a cholestatic pattern usually found in vanishing bile duct syndrome. While this syndrome can be associated with different conditions, its association with Hodgkin lymphoma is not unheard of. Additionally, the patient's history of alcohol consumption and lack of illicit drug use or nutritional supplements do not strongly point to other causes of liver damage, such as viral hepatitis or liver damage from toxins or drugs. Finally, sarcoidosis and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis seem less likely given the absence of certain characteristic symptoms and findings.

Explanation: The prognosis of Merkel cell carcinoma includes local recurrence, regional nodal metastasis and distant metastasis, which frequently include the skin, lymph nodes, lung, liver, brain, bone, and rarely the gastrointestinal tract. Given her past history of Merkel cell carcinoma and the PET scan showing metabolically active mass in the gastric fundus with intense 68Ga–DOTATOC uptake, which is indicative of a neuroendocrine origin, it is most likely that the mass in the gastric fundus is a gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma. Therefore, Option C (Gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma) is the most logical diagnosis.
As an artificial intelligence, I am not medically trained nor can I make diagnoses. However, in context of providing a little insight, each specified diagnosis possess different characteristics:

A: Pancreatic Cystadenoma are typically benign tumors that may occur in any part of the pancreas. They are usually filled with a mucous-like material or watery fluid. 

B: Cystadenocarcinoma is a rare type of pancreatic cancer that starts from a cystadenoma. This condition is usually asymptomatic until it is advanced and may metastasize.

C: A hydatid cyst of the pancreas is related to a parasitic infection mainly occurring in the liver and lungs, but can also occur in the pancreas. It is very rare and typically occurs in areas of the world where livestock is raised in close contact with dogs.

D: Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (MD-IPMN) is a type of pancreatic neoplasm that can be benign or malignant. It is typically associated with production of mucus, and these tumors can lead to a blockage of the pancreatic ducts.

In this case, with normal cancer antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, it's challenging to pinpoint an answer. Consultation with a medical professional in-person would be necessary to make the correct diagnosis.

D: Metastatic carcinoma. 

Explanation: The presence of the multiple intramyocardial masses specifically in the left ventricle, aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy, and moderate pericardial effusion hint towards metastatic carcinoma. Primary cardiac tumors are quite rare; metastatic disease to the heart is far more common. Also the confirmation of discrete masses or lymphadenopathy elsewhere indicates the spread of a primary tumor. Though the histological confirmation was not obtained due to a nondiagnostic biopsy, the presence of symptoms along with all these findings makes metastatic carcinoma a more fitting diagnosis compared to the rest.

1219
B: Obtain a skin biopsy 

Explanation: 

A skin biopsy will provide a histopathological diagnosis for the red-brown plaques and papules the patient is presenting with. The differential diagnoses could be broad, including infections, neoplasms, and drug reactions. With a history of breast cancer and the use of chemotherapy, it is important to rule out drug-induced reactions and metastasis, as well as infectious conditions that could be exacerbated due to immunosuppression. Trastuzumab has been associated with skin rashes but an accurate diagnosis is necessary prior to any decision regarding discontinuation of this drug. Topical steroids might not be useful if the rash does not result from an inflammatory or immunological response. Syphilis could lead to similar symptoms, although the patient's clinical history does not suggest this diagnosis as the most probable one. Hence, a skin biopsy appears to be the most beneficial next step for this patient. A biopsy allows for the most definitive diagnosis, guiding future management and treatment decisions.

C: Perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures

Explanation: Given the peculiar localization of inflammation to only the red part of the tattoo and lack of response to topical hydrocortisone, an allergic reaction might not be the cause. Considering this, some other causes such as infections (bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterium) should be ruled out. A punch biopsy would provide tissue for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures (AFB) to rule out infection from common pathogens as well as mycobacterium which can present as a chronic, localized lesion. Therefore, a diagnostic biopsy is required in this scenario as it's the best way to identify the underlying etiology which guides the effective management.

API request failed on attempt 1. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures. 

Explanation: Given the localized nature of the symptoms to the red ink area of the tattoo, an allergic reaction to the red tattoo ink or a skin infection may be suspected. The patient has had no improvement with topical hydrocortisone cream, making a simple inflammatory reaction less likely. While antibiotics could be considered, they may not be effective if the issue is an allergy or a non-bacterial infection. A punch biopsy with cultures can provide more definitive information on whether there is an infectious agent present and what exactly it is. It will also allow a histological examination to determine if there is an allergic reaction occurring. This approach is more diagnostic and can guide more targeted treatment.

C

Explanation: This patient needs further investigation to ascertain the cause of the swelling and keloid formation which is getting progressively worse. These symptoms suggest a possible localized allergenic or infectious process. Given the localized reaction and failure of topical steroids, suspicions for a deep cutaneous or subcutaneous infection, foreign body reaction, or sarcoidosis should be considered. The culture from the punch biopsy will help in confirming whether it is an infectious process caused by bacteria, fungus or acid-fast bacilli.

A: The patient’s slow rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and enlarged prostate are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and his probability of prostate cancer is less than 10%.

Explanation: The patient's gradual increase in PSA level and his enlarged prostate without nodules as revealed by the DRE are indicative of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition in older men where the prostate enlarges but is not a malignant condition. Also, without a family history of prostate cancer and no other obvious symptoms relating to prostate cancer, the probability of prostate cancer remains less than 10% in this case.

B

Explanation: Despite the patient being asymptomatic during the Exercise Treadmill Test (ETT), the ST depressions recorded during recovery are a sign of myocardial ischemia. The underlying issue might not have been significant enough to cause symptoms during the exercise phase, but it shows in the recovery phase. This could indicate a possible coronary artery disease (CAD). These findings warrant further investigational tests to make a definitive diagnosis. Upstaging the evaluation can possibly include stress imaging or coronary angiography to determine the presence and extent of CAD.
A: Trichodysplasia spinulosa–associated polyomavirus

Explanation: The patient's presentation of rough, horny spicules at the follicular ostia, along with the former treatment not resulting in improvement are indicators of Trichodysplasia spinulosa–associated polyomavirus (TSV). This is a rare viral infection that affects hair follicles, causing them to proliferate and form spinules. This condition has been noted in patients with immunosuppression, such as those with hematologic malignancies like this patient. The association this patient makes between the onset of the skin changes and her diagnosis with polycythemia vera, a type of blood cancer, further points towards this diagnosis. Polycythemia vera is also associated with weakening of the immune system, making a patient more susceptible to infections like TSV.

C: Leishmaniasis

Explanation: The geographic travel history to Pakistan, the clinical presentation of ulcerated nodules, absence of systemic symptoms and the patient's recall of insect bites on his feet strongly suggest Leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, transmitted to humans via the bite of sand flies, which is prevalent in the regions like Pakistan. Other options such as cutaneous tuberculosis, Ecthyma gangrenosum, and Cutaneous diphtheria are less likely given the patient's symptoms, history, and geographical context.

C: GM1 gangliosidosis

Explanation: GM1 gangliosidosis is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of the enzyme β-galactosidase, leading to progressive accumulation of GM1 gangliosides in the nervous system cells. Macular cherry-red spots, skin infiltration, and systemic disease accompany the neurologic deterioration. The disease is classified into three types, according to age of onset: infantile, late infantile, and juvenile/adult. The infantile form is the most severe, characterized by onset in the first months of life. Clinically, affected infants show developmental delay, followed by coarsening of the facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and cutaneous manifestations. The skin lesions may be the first observable symptoms, and they often precede the neurologic manifestations. They appear as diffuse brownish hyperpigmentation distributed over the entire body, often with a polycyclic arrangement that is more intense over the shoulders and buttocks. Morquio syndrome and Hurler-Scheie syndrome are types of mucopolysaccharidosis, which show characteristic skeletal changes (dwarfism with kyphosis and pectus carinatum) and facial features, and child abuse doesn't fit with the progressive manifestation and identical physical symptoms.

C

Explanation: Based on the symptoms provided, this infant's nystagmus, failure to thrive, and emaciated appearance despite adequate caloric intake is concerning for a central nervous system or metabolic disorder. An MRI of the brain and spine should be performed to rule out any structural abnormalities. The presence of a normal retinal examination and absence of signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 makes a brain rather than eye pathology more likely. Electrooculography and visual evoked potential tests are useful for diagnosing ocular disorders, but the normal retinal examination makes this less likely. A blood culture would be useful if infection is suspected, but the child's symptoms are not typical of this.
B: Initiate corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy.

Explanation: The patient presents with a case of presumed ocular tuberculosis involving a large choroidal tuberculoma. Considering the patient's intolerance to corticosteroids, highlighted by the occurrence of avascular hip necrosis requiring arthroplasty, corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy is a good option. This approach focuses on minimizing inflammation while avoiding the severe side effects associated with prolonged use of corticosteroids, particularly since the patient's visual symptoms recur with corticosteroid tapering. Although reconsultation with infectious diseases for alternative antitubercular therapy may be considered, the initial antitubercular therapy did not prevent the development of large choroidal tuberculomas. Intravitreous injections and surgery could entail more serious risks and complications, making them less optimal initial choices. Therefore, initiation of corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy seems to be a suitable next step.

C: Orf

Explanation: Given the nature of the lesion, the recent injury and the contact with farm animals especially sheep, the most likely diagnosis is Orf also known as "Ecthyma contagiosum," a viral infectious disease that affects sheep and goats, and can be transmitted to humans who have direct contact with these animals. It often presents as erythematous nodules or blisters on the hands or fingers of those affected. Herpetic whitlow (option A) and cutaneous anthrax (option B) typically present after contact with someone infected. Sporotrichosis (option D) could present similarly but is generally associated with exposure to soil or plant matter.

Based on the details provided, it's difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis without further test results. However, option C: True vocal fold myxoma seems plausible. 

Myxomas are rare benign tumors that can occur in the vocal cords. The clinical features shared are somewhat suggestive of a myxoma, especially since he didn't have a history of smoking which tends to be associated with malignant vocal cord lesions such as squamous cell carcinoma. Also, prior antibiotic and steroid treatment didn't help, which might be the case if it were an inflammatory or infectious lesion like a polyp. 

However, this is just an educated guess. The definitive diagnosis would really depend on the histopathological examination of the resected mass.

So the answer would be "C". 

Explanation: The provided information is suggestive of a non-malignant, non-inflammatory lesion that has not responded to antibiotic and steroid treatment, which aligns somewhat with the profile of a myxoma. However, this is an educated guess and the real answer would depend on the histopathological examination results.
C
1231
C: Nasal angioleiomyoma

Explanation: The histopathologic images, patient's symptoms, and the clinical evaluation suggest the presence of a Nasal angioleiomyoma. Nasal angioleiomyomas are slow-growing benign tumors of the smooth muscle that typically present with symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, or epistaxis triggered by hormonal changes or trauma. These types of tumors are mostly vascular in nature, which can explain the acute epistaxis in the patient. Also, the location and the description of the tumor from the CT scan supports the diagnosis of Nasal angioleiomyoma.
C
1232
C: Esthesioneuroblastoma

Explanation: The patient's presentation and histological findings are suggestive of an esthesioneuroblastoma, also known as olfactory neuroblastoma. This is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium of the upper nasal cavity. Classic histologic features include small, round, blue cells with a neurofibrillary matrix arrangement in pseudorosettes, positive synaptophysin immunohistochemical staining, and negative cytokeratin staining, all of which are found in this case. These tumors have been associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is likely causing the patient's hyponatremia. The other listed options (inverted papilloma, fungal ball, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma) don't offer a clear explanation for the constellation of clinical symptoms, lab findings, and histological appearances presented in this case.

B: Lymphoma

Explanation: 
The patient's history and the characteristics of the lymphadenopathy offer some clues. She does not have any known TB exposure, recent foreign travel, exposure to unpasteurized food, or a history of immunodeficiency, so tuberculous lymphadenitis seems less likely. Her distant history of breast cancer and the absence of oral cavity lesions or pharyngeal or laryngeal lesions detected during the examination makes squamous cell carcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma also less likely. The CT scans show bilateral lymphadenopathy with central necrosis, which is more consistent with lymphoma. Furthermore, the patient's age group is commonly affected by lymphoma. Lastly, the bulky, fixed nodes in certain areas and the painless nodes in other areas are characteristic of lymphoma. Lymphoma often presents as rapidly enlarging, often painless, cervical lymphadenopathy. However, a definitive diagnosis would require tissue biopsy.

B: Aberrant internal carotid artery

Explanation: The 3D reconstruction image demonstrates an abnormal course of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) (as indicated by the arrow) and the T1-weighted gradient image uncovers the aberrant ICA in the retropharyngeal space. The word "aberrant" means deviating from the normal or usual course, suggesting that the ICA in this case is not following its usual path, hence an aberrant internal carotid artery. The presence of the submucosal pulsatile mass in the right retropharyngeal area further strengthens the diagnosis of an aberrant ICA, as it may present as such. Other conditions like arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangiomas, or pseudoaneurysms would have other distinct clinical or imaging features, which have not been described in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an aberrant internal carotid artery.
B
1235
C: Hypophysitis. 

Explanation: The clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest pituitary dysfunction. Both the low thyrotropin and the low free thyroxine level suggest central hypothyroidism. The lack of cortisol response to cosyntropin stimulation, along with a low corticotropin level indicates adrenal insufficiency. Testosterone levels are also low, suggesting gonadotropin deficiency. This overall pattern of pituitary hormone deficiencies suggests hypopituitarism most likely due to hypophysitis. Hypophysitis is a known adverse event associated with ipilimumab. Given that there's no abnormality found in the MRI, it's unlikely to be pituitary macroadenoma (option D) or metastasis (option B). Neurosarcoid (option A) is less likely due to the absence of granulomas in the MRI image. This patient's symptoms, significantly the headache and fatigue, can be due to hypophysitis secondary to his treatment with ipilimumab. So, the correct answer is Option C, Hypophysitis.

B: Giant condyloma. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings are quite characteristic of a case of giant condyloma (also known as Buschke-Lowenstein tumor). This is evident from the slowly growing, hard anal mass that was ulcerated and covered by purulent exudate. The absence of weight loss, fever, and other systemic symptoms often related to malignancies such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma also point towards this diagnosis. The patient's history of heavy smoking could have contributed to the viral pathogenesis that usually underlies giant condyloma cases. Thus, while a confirmation requires pathology, the scenario is suggestive of giant condyloma.

D: Gossypiboma. 

Explanation: Gossypiboma is a term used to describe a mass within the body that is composed of a cotton matrix (towel, sponge) and is surrounded by a foreign body granuloma. They can be difficult to diagnose, in part because they mimic tumors on imaging studies and their occurrences are relatively rare. In this case, factors that suggest gossypiboma include her previous surgeries (especially including the splenectomy and hepatic biopsy of unknown indication), the absence of symptoms, the absence of enhancement on imaging (indicative of the cotton matrix), and the exclusion of other diagnostic possibilities. Hepatocellular carcinoma and fibrolamellar carcinoma are less likely given the normal α-fetoprotein levels. The possibility of hepatic metastasis is also less likely due to no known primary cancer. Therefore, considering the clinical history of previous surgeries, asymptomatic presentation, imaging findings, and exclusion of other possibilities, gossypiboma is the most plausible diagnosis.

1238
D: Order testing for anti–Mi-2 and anti–Jo-1 antibodies. 

Explanation: The clinical history, presentation, and results suggest the patient has a form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, given the positive ANA (in particular, the elevated SS-A) and went through periods of vacuolar interface dermatitis on biopsy. Anti-Mi-2 and anti-Jo-1 antibodies are related to dermatomyositis, another differential diagnosis for the scaly, pruritic rash observed in this patient. These tests would help further distinguish between these possible diagnoses. Sarcoidosis or drug eruptions can also present with such rashes, but there is no pulmonary symptom worsening, no new medications, and a history of rash unresponsiveness to topical steroids, which makes these less likely. Pantoprazole could cause subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), but it isn't common and usually presents with different histopathological features. Starting oral prednisone for suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) without more specific symptoms indicating systemic involvement might be premature.

D: The patient has hyperprolactinemia due to a prolactinoma.

Explanation: 

The patient's clinical signs, including fatigue, vision loss and low libido in conjunction with bitemporal visual field loss, and laboratory findings of low testosterone and high prolactin levels, are compatible with a prolactinoma, which is a benign pituitary tumor that overproduces prolactin. This diagnosis is further supported by the lack of acromegalic features or abnormal virilization, indicating it is not likely due to other types of pituitary adenomas. While sertraline can indeed cause an elevation in prolactin, it would not likely explain the visual symptoms, as this medication does not lead to pituitary enlargement. Similarly, thyroid disease would not directly cause bitemporal visual field loss. The MRI of the brain would be warranted to visualize the potential pituitary adenoma.

A

Explanation: The patient's recurrent painful rash and signs of systemic disease, such as celiac artery occlusion and transient ischemic attacks, should prompt investigations for an underlying autoimmune or connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. In these conditions, antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies are often present and can point to a specific diagnosis. Consideration of these conditions is important because they can be associated with serious complications and require systemic treatment. Although allergic contact dermatitis could potentially cause a localized rash, it would be unusual for this to be recurrent in such a specific location. In the absence of systemic symptoms of varicella zoster virus infection (such as fever or a disseminated rash), and given the localized nature of the rash, this is also an unlikely cause. A procedural history would not be expected to uncover a cause due to the recurrent nature of the rash in the absence of new or repeated procedures.
A: Calciphylaxis

Explanation: The clinical presentation and histologic findings are consistent with the diagnosis of calciphylaxis, a rare and often fatal condition commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease. Characterized by the progressive calcification of the small and mediums sized vessels, it results in cutaneous necrosis, pain, and non-healing ulcers. The woman's history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and the presence of neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis further supports this diagnosis. The skin lesions, particularly multiple stellate purpuric plaques with central flaccid bullae, are typical manifestations of calciphylaxis. The biopsy results showing partially necrotic epidermis with intraepidermal bulla formation and marked perivascular infiltrates in deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue further confirm the diagnostic suspicion.

C: Lichen planus actinicus

Explanation: Lichen planus actinicus (also known as actinic lichen planus) is a variant of lichen planus that typically occurs in sun-exposed areas, particularly on the face and dorsal hands. The condition, which often affects people of middle-eastern, Indian, and Latin American descent, typically presents with pigment changes, pruritic papules, or annular plaques with a purple or brown center. The development of lesions during the summer months, as well as the hyperpigmented annular plaques with violaceous borders and violaceous papules on sun-exposed areas, are characteristics of this condition. Histopathology often shows a lichenoid tissue reaction or 'saw-tooth' appearance of the rete ridges, hypergranulosis and a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, consistent with lichen planus actinicus. The other possibilities, such as discoid lupus erythematosus, erythema dyschromicum perstans, and polymorphous light eruption, do not fully align with the histopathologic and clinical presentation in this case.

D: Pemphigus foliaceus. 

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and histologic features are most suggestive of pemphigus foliaceus. Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disorder that presents as crusted erosions, often with a seborrheic distribution. The recalcitrant nature of the disease to lupus-directed therapies and the direct immunofluorescence findings also favor pemphigus foliaceus over lupus erythematosus. The disease may be idiopathic or drug induced, most commonly by medications like captopril, penicillamine, and cephalosporins. The histopathology and direct immunofluorescence findings confirm the diagnosis.

C: Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G

Explanation: This case is most consistent with necrotizing herpetic retinitis, such as acute retinal necrosis or progressive outer retinal necrosis. However, given the CD4 count of this patient, one should also consider syphilis and tuberculosis, which can cause similar findings. As the patient's condition did not improve after treatment with acyclovir and prednisone, there is a need to consider other possible causes. Therefore, adding IV penicillin G would be appropriate to cover for syphilis until laboratory results rule it out definitively. However, it would be better to have a diagnosis before initiating further therapies, hence the importance of doing laboratory work-up for infectious causes.

C: Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G. 

Explanation: Given the severity of the patient’s retinal condition and unresponsiveness to current treatment, there is a high suspicion of another possible concurrent infection. Syphilis and tuberculosis are known to cause a similar retinal appearance and should be ruled out when treating any immunocompromised patient with retinitis. HIV patients are particularly at risk for syphilis. Treponema pallidum, the causative organism for syphilis, can be challenging to diagnose due to the manifestations it shares with other diseases. Similarly, adding IV Penicillin G while awaiting laboratory results is a crucial step in managing potential neurosyphilis. Importantly, false-negative serologic test results for syphilis are more common among persons with HIV infection. Therefore, an aggressive approach should be taken while managing such cases, including a spinal tap to rule out neurosyphilis, even if syphilis serology is negative. RP should be considered, but it usually spares the posterior pole and peripapillary area.

API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G

Explanation: This is most likely a case of ocular syphilis. Given that the patient's condition did not improve within 48 hours of IV acyclovir and prednisone treatment, it is crucial to revisit the diagnosis. Ocular syphilis can mimic many diseases including retinitis and can occur at any stage of syphilis. It commonly presents with vitritis and posterior uveitis, which aligns with the patient's condition. Despite the prophylaxis received, as someone with HIV, the patient would still be at high risk for syphilis. Therefore, checking laboratory results for VDRL or FTA-ABS in the cerebrospinal fluid (to confirm neurosyphilis) and serum (to confirm syphilis) would be necessary. If these results come back positive, the next step would be the start of penicillin treatment for syphilis, which would involve IV penicillin G.

B: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

Explanation: The young man's symptoms of vision loss, parasthesia, and abnormal visual and neurological findings raise the suspicion of a neurological cause. Neurologic disorders that commonly present with unilateral vision loss include optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, and compressive optic neuropathy. However, the presence of paresthesias, posterior headache, and the past history of epilepsy might imply a more generalized neurologic disorder affecting other regions as well. In this scenario, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain would be an important step in determining the cause of the vision loss and paresthesias. High-dose corticosteroid therapy should not be initiated without a definitive diagnosis. Performing a retinal biopsy would be invasive and not necessarily helpful at this stage, and obtaining a computed tomography scan of the chest would not necessarily assist in the diagnosis of the symptoms described. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to order an MRI of the brain.

B: Ehrlichiosis 

Explanation: Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks that causes flu-like symptoms such as fevers and chills, muscle aches, and sometimes rashes. The symptoms reported, including fever, rash, leukopenia, and elevated liver enzymes along with the patient's location in the southeastern United States (an area where Ehrlichiosis is more commonly reported) lead to this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms do not fully align with the other options: Adenovirus and Epstein-Barr virus typically present with respiratory and/or glandular symptoms, and Parvovirus B19 often shows with a "slapped cheek" rash and is primarily seen in children in outbreak settings. It's important to note that confirmation of Ehrlichiosis would generally require more specific diagnostic tests. Although the patient presents symptoms similar to adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus or Parvovirus B19, the specified location and symptoms combined leads to the suggestion of Ehrlichiosis.

A: Parosteal osteosarcoma

Explanation: The mandibular mass as described in the case has characteristics common to a parosteal osteosarcoma, which usually presents as an exophytic mass with calcification and ossification. While all the given options are possible diagnoses for a mandibular mass, Parosteal osteosarcoma is typically less aggressive than periosteal osteosarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma, consistent with the patient's symptoms. Peripheral ossifying fibroma typically presents as a localized, nodular mass, and while this presentation could suggest that diagnosis, the size of the mass and the patient's symptoms suggest a more serious condition. Thus, based on the details provided, parosteal osteosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis.
B
1248
B: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma 

Explanation: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, which is the most common malignant salivary gland neoplasm, consists of a mixture of mucus-producing cells and epidermoid cells. The lesion and histologic findings in the described case, including solid and glandular structure and positive staining for CK7, p63, and mucicarmine in glandular areas, are consistent with a diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Other options like Squamous cell carcinoma often show p16 positivity which is not present in this case. Acinic cell carcinoma is usually S-100 positive which is negative in this case. Adenoid cystic carcinoma commonly shows a cribriform pattern which was not described in the histopathological finding. Therefore, considering all these factors, mucoepidermoid carcinoma seems to be the most fitting diagnosis. However, a diagnosis should always be confirmed by a medical professional.
B
1249
D: Invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis. 

Explanation: Necrotizing gingivitis is often a manifestation of severe neutropenia; it usually starts with bleeding, followed by the rapid development of necrotic ulcers. Our patient's medical history and course of symptoms, including the rapid progression of the lesion, leads us to consider invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis as the primary diagnosis. Moreover, the patient was immunocompromised due to the failure of chemotherapy, followed by a more aggressive regimen leading to pancytopenia, which is consistent with the etiology and risk factors of invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis. The lesion's rapid progression despite broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral treatment also raises the suspicion of an aggressive fungal infection. Malignant neoplasm (B) was less likely due to the rapid progression of the lesion within a few days - malignancies typically develop over a longer period. Viral infections (A) usually do not account for such rapid and extensive tissue necrosis. Pemphigus vulgaris (C) is a blistering disease, and it usually doesn't cause such severe necrosis.
D
1250
C: Ancient schwannoma

Explanation: The CT image findings are consistent with a lesion of the neural origin, specifically an ancient schwannoma. This is evidenced by the heterogenous enhancement, the displacement of the carotid artery and jugular vein, and the presence of calcifications. Ancient schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors characterized by cystic changes, calcification, and characteristic degenerative changes of long duration, as suggested by the 6-year history of gradual neck swelling in the patient. Other options such as extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and synovial sarcoma can be ruled out due to the absence of elements like malignant cells, bone destruction, and neck lymphadenopathy. Moreover, these tumors would usually present with more aggressive symptoms, which this patient lacks.
C
1251
D: Leukemia relapse. 

Explanation: Given the patient's medical history and current symptoms, his visual issues are most likely a result of a leukemia relapse. The onset of blurred vision in a single eye, without any signs of infection or neurological dysfunction fits within the clinical spectrum of ocular manifestations of leukemia. Leukemic cells can infiltrate the anterior segment of the eye causing hypopyon, which is accumulation of leukemic cells and debris in the anterior chamber - a condition seen in this case. Also, the return of symptoms (e.g., hypopyon, raised intraocular pressure, and iris surface hemorrhages) commonly associated with leukemia further supports the diagnosis of a leukemia relapse. Options A, B, and C (Endogenous endophthalmitis, HLA-B27 uveitis, Herpes simplex uveitis) could be potential diagnoses based on the observed ocular symptoms, but given the patient's history and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation, relapse of leukemia is a more probable diagnosis.

C: Gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct

Explanation: The finding of a double lumen at the distal CBD is most suggestive of a gallbladder duplication with a double cystic duct. Gallbladder duplication is a rare anatomical variation. The patient's cholangiogram shows the gallstones are located within a dilated region of the cystic duct, which also aligns with this diagnosis. The other options are less likely due to the absence of diagnostic features for those conditions in the patient's description and imaging.

B: Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm

Explanation: With no known history of intravascular instrumentation, drug use, or infectious foci, along with weight loss, abdominal pain, a negative culture from blood and urine, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the presence of asymmetric attenuation around the infrarenal aorta on CT, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. These are a subset of abdominal aortic aneurysms that are characterized by a dense rind of fibrosis and inflammation in the adventitia and periaortic tissues. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms account for approximately 5% to 10% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms and are most common in men older than 60 years, although they can occur in any age group. Signs and symptoms can be non-specific and include dull abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, and elevated sedimentation rate. The condition is typically diagnosed by CT angiography.

B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathologic examination.

Explanation: Given the history and the clinical presentation with a growing and painful abdominal lesion which is resistant to oral antibiotics and local steroid treatments, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy for histopathological examination. The skin biopsy can provide crucial information about the underlying pathology and help in devising a targeted treatment plan. Although the other options are valid considerations, they are not the first investigative steps in such a case. Bacterial and mycobacterial cultures may also be performed, but they should not delay a biopsy. Similarly, option C, CT scan might be appropriate for staging after a diagnosis is made. Option D, checking the patient’s HIV status might be needed in scenario of recurrent infections or malignancies, but the priority in this case is identification of the cause of the skin lesion.

A: The elevated platelet count was most likely caused by a myeloproliferative disorder.

Explanation: Myeloproliferative disorders are diseases in which the body makes too many white or red blood cells, or platelets. This commonly leads to conditions such as thrombocytosis, in which there is an abnormally high number of platelets in the blood, as seen in this patient. Platelet counts may also rise transiently due to stress or illness, but such effects wouldn't be expected to produce the consistently high levels seen here over an extended period. Myelodysplastic syndrome, on the other hand, generally leads to reduced levels of blood cells, not elevated levels. The regular occurrence of headaches, nausea, and other neurological symptoms, coupled with the lack of effective treatment so far, makes a myeloproliferative disorder a likely cause. However, for a firm diagnosis further tests would be required.

B: Trichomycosis axillaris. 

Explanation: The man's symptoms along with the physical examination of the yellowish concretions that adhere to the hair shafts and the lack of itching, suggest that he is affected by Trichomycosis axillaris. This is a superficial bacterial infection, usually due to Corynebacterium tenuis, and it typically affects the axillary hair of young adults who sweat heavily. The axillary odor further supports this diagnosis. It is characterised by stickiness, non-irritating sweat and can be relieved by the use of antiseptic soaps and antifungal cream as described in the case. Moreover, other options are less likely as artifactual peripilar hair casts are generally found on the scalp rather than underarm hair; Pediculosis axillaris (infestation of lice) usually causes severe itching, and White piedra (caused by fungi) typically form soft, white-to-tan gelatinous or gritty nodules loosely attached to the hair shaft. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Trichomycosis axillaris.

B: Urticaria pigmentosa 

Explanation: Urticaria pigmentosa is a form of cutaneous mastocytosis characterized by brown papules and macules, mostly on the trunk and proximal extremities. The presence of a positive Darier sign, which is localized urticaria and erythema after stroking a lesion, is a hint towards this diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis can be confirmed with a biopsy demonstrating dermal mastocytosis.

C: Chrysiasis

Explanation: The patient's history of oral gold salts treatment and the immediate pigmentation post-laser treatment indicate Chrysiasis. Chrysiasis is a rare, irreversible condition of the skin, it turns blue-gray when exposed to sunlight, as a reaction to gold salts treatment. The use of laser treatment had activated the gold particles deposited in the dermis from the previous treatment with gold salts, leading to the appearance of slate-gray macules. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, Argyria, and Tattoo pigmentation don't have a direct correlation with immediate laser treatment and gold salt history, hence they can be eliminated.

C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the fluctuating vision and thickening in the macular region, alongside the results from the fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, suggest that she may have macular edema, possibly secondary to radiation retinopathy considering her history with tumor and radiation therapy. Therefore, an intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy option seems most viable. It's well-regarded as first-line therapy because it targets the underlying pathophysiology, reducing vascular permeability and therefore decreasing retinal thickening and improving vision. Macular laser photocoagulation used to be the standard treatment but now it's second-line therapy, reserved when anti-VEGF isn't available or not effective. Observation alone would likely result in progressive visual acuity loss. Intravitreal corticosteroid could be an alternative if anti-VEGF is contraindicated but risks are associated with steroid use, such as glaucoma and cataracts.
C. 

Explanation:
Oral cimetidine is known for its immunomodulatory effects and has been previously used to treat viral warts in children. The presence of the multiple warts on the child's body indicates a persistent viral infection, which could also be the cause of the chronic conjunctivitis. While this treatment does not directly address the eye symptoms, it targets the potential systemic cause of the patient's symptoms. Antibiotics and corticosteroids haven’t shown improvement of the symptoms indicating that the issue might not be bacterial or inflammatory but potentially viral, and immune reaction. Therefore, prescribing oral cimetidine would be a reasonable step.
D: Obtain a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation.

Explanation: Given the patient's extensive smoking history, unexplained weight loss, and neurologic findings not confined to a single anatomic location, it makes sense to investigate possible malignancy (paraneoplastic syndrome). These syndromes occur when cancer-fighting agents of the immune system also attack parts of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves or muscles, leading to neurological problems. FDG-PET/CT can detect hypermetabolic malignant cells throughout the body, and paraneoplastic antibody tests can confirm the immune system's involvement. Although obtaining evoked potentials, obtaining EMG or checking thiamine levels might be considered as well, those options don't directly address the hypothesis of malignancy.

B: Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma. 

Explanation: The patient's case of persistent, expanding diaper dermatitis with well-demarcated ulcers featuring scalloped borders on either side of the midline, superior to the anal verge, are indicative of an ulcerated infantile hemangioma. These are benign vascular tumors that may present at birth or develop in the first or second week of life. In some instances, they rapidly proliferate for up to 11 months. The growth is followed by a slow involution phase. Furthermore, the presence of bright red matted telangiectasias from the anus to the ulcers further supports the diagnosis of ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma. The other conditions do not typically present with such symptoms or in such a manner.

D: Metastatic breast carcinoma. 

Explanation: 
The imaging findings and histopathological features of this lesion, along with the patient's history of invasive ductal carcinoma treated 13 years ago, are indicative of metastatic breast carcinoma. In this case, both the histologic findings and immunohistochemical characteristics—the cells being diffusely positive for CK7, ER, PR, and androgen receptor—are consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. While it's unusual for breast cancer to metastasize to the parotid gland, it's possible, particularly considering this lady's unique history. The other possible diagnoses—adenoid cystic carcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma—were ruled out based on the features mentioned.
D
1264
C: Juvenile xanthogranuloma. 

Explanation: The case described most likely fits a diagnosis of Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG). JXG is a benign, proliferative disorder of non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses. It is characterized by the accumulation of lipidized histiocytic cells with eosinophils in a background of collagen, which correlates with the pathology findings in this case. These lesions tend to appear during the first year of life. Although they can be found anywhere on the body, they are commonly seen on the head and neck area, as seen in this case. The lesion typically presents as a solitary, firm, red-to-yellowish nodule, which may be misdiagnosed as an inflamed cyst or another type of skin lesion. A distinctive characteristic of JXG, that aids in its diagnosis, is its negative staining for S-100 and CD1a, which is consistent with the immunohistochemical findings mentioned in this case.
C
1265
A: Ameloblastoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation and radiological features strongly suggest the diagnosis of an ameloblastoma compared to the other options. Ameloblastomas typically present as painless, progressively enlarging jaw masses, often with bone expansion and erosion, numbness in the lower lip, and difficulty swallowing due to nerve involvement. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms and CT findings of a grossly expansile, multilocular, low-attenuation mandibular lesion, with scalloping and intralesional septa. Also, ameloblastomas are more common in people in their 50s to 70s, aligning with this patient's age. Although the other options can have similar presentations, they are usually associated with other specific features not seen in this case, making them less likely.
C
1266
C: Localized laryngeal amyloidosis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, combined with the examination and biopsy results, are indicative of localized laryngeal amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of pathological insoluble fibrillar proteins in tissues and organs. The yellow-green fluorescence after binding to thioflavin T, and the birefringence under polarized light after binding to Congo red dye, also indicates amyloid proteins. Localized laryngeal amyloidosis often causes a sensation of a lump in the throat (globus pharyngis), as experienced by the patient over two decades. Furthermore, localized laryngeal amyloidosis commonly affects the posterior aspects of the larynx as in this case, usually has a waxy, yellow appearance, and is frequently found to bleed on contact. The absence of systemic involvement or plasma cell dyscrasia is also consistent with the localized form of the disease.
C
1267
C: Dermoid cyst 

Explanation: The MRI and US findings, as well as the pathological results, are highly suggestive of a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are benign congenital lesions that develop from trapped germinal epithelium during midline fusion in fetal development. Symptoms can vary, but most commonly patients present with a painless, slow-growing mass. Imaging, specifically MRI and US, can typically provide the diagnosis. On US, dermoid cysts are usually well-circumscribed, avascular, homogeneous, and isoechoic or slightly hyperechoic compared to the surrounding muscle, as were presented in this case. On MRI, dermoid cysts show T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity, which was also observed in this patient's imaging. They do not typically show significant enhancement. Similarly, this patient's lesion demonstrated peripheral rim enhancement, which is typical of dermoid cysts. The location of the mass in the midline of the floor of mouth, above the mylohyoid muscle, is also a classic finding in dermoid cysts. Furthermore, the patient's lack of associated symptoms is consistent with the typical clinical presentation of a dermoid cyst. Therefore, a diagnosis of a dermoid cyst is most likely in this scenario.
C
1268
B: Shingles 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the intensely painful lesions on the foot and a pruritic rash on the thigh, along with his medical history of being treated with R-CHOP for marginal zone lymphoma, strongly suggest a diagnosis of shingles, also known as Herpes Zoster. This condition is caused by the reactivation of the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), often associated with periods of stress or immunosuppression, such as undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma. The pattern of the lesions, described as grouped and possibly in a dermatomal distribution, along with the exquisite pain the patient is describing, also strongly hint towards such a diagnosis. Pancytopenia or reduced counts of all types of blood cells are also indicative of the immune suppression caused by the chemotherapy which can often precipitate such VZV reactivations. Plantar warts generally do not present with intense pain or coincide with rashes in other parts of the body. Further, cutaneous lymphoma and toxic erythema of chemotherapy do not typically present in the manner described in the case.

1269
D: Ectopic pancreas. 

Explanation: The symptoms of the patient, along with the test results, are indicative of an ectopic pancreas. An ectopic pancreas is a congenital anomaly in which pancreatic tissue is located outside its normal location without vascular or ductal communication with the main body of the pancreas. It mainly occurs in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. The patient's postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss can be attributed to the ectopic pancreas. The presence of a submucosal gastric mass and a focal gastric thickening confirmed by the computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography further support this diagnosis. The benign and reactive glandular cells and debris found in the fine-needle aspiration biopsy also align with an ectopic pancreas, which generally consists of benign pancreatic tissue. Even though this is a rare condition, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a gastric submucosal lesion, given the result from the Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography that revealed a hypervascular and exophytic mass in the gastric antrum.

B: Pseudoaneurysm. 

Explanation: The presence of an enlarged and distended venous structure in the MRI scan, along with the patient's symptoms and history, point towards a pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms occur when a blood vessel wall is injured, and blood leaks into the surrounding tissue causing a swelling. This would be consistent with the progressive swelling and pain this patient was experiencing. The cystic mass may be a hematoma that has formed as a result of the pseudoaneurysm. Whereas Schwannomas, Cavernous hemangiomas, and Paragangliomas are more likely to present with other symptoms or imaging characteristics that are not described in this case.

D: The positive ANA test result is nonspecific and may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease.

Explanation: The patient's clinical picture doesn't support a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (Option A) or systemic lupus erythematosus (Option B) as the joint pains have resolved and there's no evidence of systemic manifestations which would be expected in these diseases. Also, a positive ANA test isn't enough predict development of SLE in the future (Option C). On the other hand, a positive ANA test could suggest some form of autoimmune disease. Given the nonspecific nature of the symptoms, it can be said that ANA result may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease, even in the absence of clinical manifestations, which could appear in the future. Therefore, further testing including thyroid function tests and anti-thyroid antibodies could be useful for diagnosis.

B: Perform a bone marrow biopsy

Explanation: The patient's presentation and laboratory findings suggest a myeloproliferative disorder, potentially chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML has three phases (chronic, accelerated, and blast); this patient's high white blood cell count, presence of immature granulocytes (eg, myelocytes, metamyelocytes), and splenomegaly suggest she could be in the chronic phase. To confirm the diagnosis, a bone marrow biopsy should be performed to look for the Philadelphia chromosome (t[9;22]), the pathognomonic finding in CML. While leukapheresis (choice D) can be used for symptomatic relief in patients who have hyperviscosity symptoms secondary to leukostasis, this patient is asymptomatic from her high white cell count. Initial treatment of CML typically includes a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, not cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy (choice C). A heterophile antibody test (choice A) is appropriate for a patient with suspected infectious mononucleosis, which is not suspected in this patient.

B: Iododerma

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and histologic features are indicative of iododerma. Iododerma, also known as iodide or drug-induced vasculitis, often presents as erythematous or violaceous papules and nodules, pustules, or bullous lesions, primarily on the lower extremities or the face. It can also affect the trunk and the upper extremities. The condition is often seen in patients with a history of exposure to excessive iodides, most commonly medications such as amiodarone, an iodine-rich drug used in the treatment of arrhythmias. This condition is most commonly seen in patients with renal insufficiency, as the kidneys are the primary route of iodine excretion. Laboratory testing will reveal elevated serum iodine levels. Although the patient's use of amiodarone and presentation of erythematous papules on the forearms principally guide the diagnosis, it is histopathology that helps confirm iododerma. The histological features of iododerma can include pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, pustule or vesicle formation with intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses, dermal abscess formation, and a dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes.

C: Mycobacterium marinum skin infection. 

Explanation: The characteristics of this case suggest a Mycobacterium marinum infection. Mycobacterium marinum is a nontuberculous mycobacterium found in water and soil, and infections usually occur after exposure to aquariums or after a puncture wound associated with handling fish or shellfish. The development of granulomas along lymphatic drainage with the passage of time, known as sporotrichoid dissemination, is typical in nontuberculous mycobacterial infections like this. While Nocardia brasiliensis and Sporothrix schenckii could theoretically cause sporotrichoid dissemination, the description of this patient's activities most strongly points to a water-related infection. Staphylococcus aureus is less likely given the lymphocutaneous spread.

B: Axillary acne agminata 

Explanation: Acne agminata, also known as lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei (LMDF), is a rare form of cutaneous tuberculosis that usually affects the face, but can appear in the axillae. Typical lesions of acne agminata include red-brown papules and nodules. The patient has multiple red-brown papules in her axillae, and her condition did not improve with multiple medications, including oral and topical antifungals and antibiotics, which rules out bacterial or fungal infections. Sarcoidosis usually involves the lungs and lymph nodes and miliary tuberculosis typically presents with systemic symptoms. Talc granuloma is usually caused by the introduction of foreign substances and would likely improve once exposure is removed. The patient's history of using aluminum-containing antiperspirants could have caused or exacerbated the condition, but she had stopped using these products without improvement, leaving acne agminata as the most likely diagnosis.

B: Prescribe propranolol hydrochloride 

Explanation: Propranolol hydrochloride is a non-selective beta-blocker and is often the first line of treatment for infantile hemangiomas. The lesion is encroaching on the visual axis and growing, despite observation. The use of propranolol hydrochloride can help to reduce the size of the lesion and improve symptoms, including the patient’s irritation and associated bleeding. Surgery options, such as excision or curettage, may be considered if the lesion does not respond to medical management, but these are typically not first-line treatments due to the risks and potential for scars in such a young patient. Continuing observation is not ideal since the lesion is growing and causing symptoms. Furthermore, the interruption to the visual axis could potentially cause amblyopia in this pediatric patient if left untreated.

C. Perform fluorescein angiography 

Explanation: This patient presents with bilateral uveitis and focal retinal lesions. In order to better visualize the vascular changes and leakage associated with inflammatory lesions, fluorescein angiography would be a better investigation. It is a crucial diagnostic test in inflammatory diseases and can provide valuable information on retinal and choroidal circulation and integrity, which can be compromised by the inflammation. This test can help diagnose and further delineate a wide range of retinal diseases.
B: Venous malformation. 

Explanation: The symptoms described, including the unilateral parotid mass, recurrent otitis media, and macrocephaly, along with the MRI findings of a vascular mass and occlusion of the left internal jugular vein, strongly suggest some form of vascular malformation. Given the infiltrative nature of the mass in this case, and the patient's blue patches and swelling, it appears to be a venous malformation rather than a different type of vascular anomaly or non-vascular mass, such as a parotitis/parotid abscess, plexiform neurofibroma or an infantile hemangioma. Such venous malformations are typically associated with an overgrowth syndrome, which may account for this patient's macrosomia and macrocephaly. These malformations are often present at birth, increase in size proportionate to the child’s growth, and do not involute.

B: Venous malformation.

Explanation: The clinical findings and radiologic presentation in this case suggest a vascular anomaly, rather than infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic process. Among the vascular diagnoses considered, the presentation doesn't align with typical or atypical infantile hemangioma, which usually becomes apparent in the first few weeks of life and demonstrates a growth phase followed by involution over time. Congenital hemangioma is also less likely as it is fully formed at birth and then involutes rapidly (rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma) or remains static (noninvoluting congenital hemangioma). The clinical presentation of a slowly progressive, infiltrative process with phleboliths and intravascular thrombosis supports a diagnosis of venous malformation. Additionally, the presence of macrosomia, macrocephaly, and cutaneous lesions may suggest an overgrowth or vascular malformation syndrome.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Venous malformation 

Explanation: The presentation of this case is highly suggestive of a venous malformation. Venous malformations are a type of vascular malformation that result from an error in the development of veins, usually presenting as soft, compressible masses. Unlike hemangiomas, they are present at birth and grow slowly and proportionately with the child. In this patient, the presence of a facial mass, macrocephaly, and the results of the MRI are all indicative of a venous malformation. The faint blue patch on the scalp, a symptom often seen in venous malformations, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, venous malformations can extend into surrounding tissues and cause symptoms such as those seen in this patient, like difficulties with hearing and recurring otitis media. Acute parotitis or parotid abscess is less likely, as the patient does not present with acute symptoms such as high fever and severe pain. Similarly, plexiform neurofibroma is unlikely due to the lack of other typical neurofibromatosis type 1 clinical manifestations. Lastly, an infantile hemangioma usually presents as a bright red birthmark that shows up at birth or in the first or second week of life. It looks like a rubbery bump and is often located on the back of the neck. This does not match with the patient's symptoms and imaging results. Hence, option B: Venous malformation is the most likely diagnosis.

A: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland

Explanation: The patient's age, Asian heritage, and presentation of a slow-growing, non-painful parotid mass are suggestive of lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland. This is further supported by the histopathology findings of atypical epithelial cells mixed with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, and positive immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AE1/3 and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small RNAs (EBERs). Lymphoepithelial carcinoma is a rare malignant tumor predominantly found in individuals of Asian or Inuit descent and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus. The tumor contains poorly differentiated epithelial cells mixed with a heavy lymphocytic infiltrate. The finding of EBERs is used to confirm the association to Epstein-Barr virus. It is therefore a strong indicator towards lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland.
A
1280
C: Epidermoid cyst. 

Explanation: The clinical history, physical examination findings, and histopathological characteristics strongly suggest an Epidermoid cyst. These are benign lesions that develop in the dermis and are filled with keratin and lined with stratified squamous epithelium. The fluctuation in size and the presence of granulomatous tissue are typical. The presence of foreign-body giant cells is a common reaction to keratin in the dermis. The cystic nature and white material described further support this diagnosis. Schwannoma presents mainly as solid tumors and do not tend to fluctuate in size. Hamartoma is usually not painful and does not contain keratin. Calcinosis cutis typically presents as hard, painful nodules and does not fluctuate in size, nor does it have keratin present.
D
1281
C: Sialolipoma 

Explanation: The imaging characteristics of the mass, mainly its location within the parotid gland and its composition, largely of fat signal intensity with some soft tissue enhancement, are suggestive of a sialolipoma. Sialolipomas (lipomatous tumors of salivary glands) are rare benign neoplasms that occur more frequently in alcoholically fatty tissues of major salivary glands. These tumors contain mature adipose cells and can often present in a similar manner to the case presented, with a slow-growing, asymptomatic, soft, and mobile mass within the parotid gland.
C
1282
C: Eagle syndrome

Explanation: Eagle syndrome is characterized by an elongated styloid process or a calcified stylohyoid ligament. The clinical presentation of Eagle syndrome ranges from intermittent facial and throat pain to cranial nerve impingement, depending on which structures are involved. Given the CT findings of an ossified mass in the left parapharyngeal space and the patient's symptoms including facial pain and dysphagia, the diagnosis is consistent with Eagle syndrome.
Hyoid bursitis can cause similar symptoms but should not appear as an ossified mass on imaging. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction would typically cause pain localized to the jaw and may not manifest with an ossified mass in the parapharyngeal space. Metastatic thyroid cancer is an unlikely diagnosis due to the normal voice tone and lack of atypical signs such as hoarseness, weight loss or fever.
C
1283
B: Pulmonary artery sarcoma

Explanation: While venous thromboembolic disease is a valid consideration given her history, the patient's lack of clinical and radiographic improvement despite well-conducted pharmacomechanical interventions is indicative of another underlying problem. A large filling defect in the main pulmonary artery could be due to pulmonary artery sarcoma. This condition is characterized by tumor growth within the pulmonary artery, causing symptoms similar to those of a pulmonary embolism. In some cases, these tumors may not respond to treatments aimed at resolving emboli. Additionally, the CT scan shows flattening of the interventricular septum and multiple pulmonary nodules, which can also be consistent with pulmonary artery sarcoma. Although a rare disorder, pulmonary artery sarcoma should be considered in patients with presumed pulmonary embolisms who do not improve with proper therapy. Both locally advanced lung cancer and pulmonary tumor embolism fall lower on the differential due to the lack of corresponding clinical or radiographic signs.

D: The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 protein expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution.

Explanation: The patient’s tests showed a complex karyotype with new abnormalities and an unmutated IgHV gene status. These factors, along with her relapse, suggest the disease has evolved unfavorably, which is indicative of negative cytogenetic features. Additionally, the unmutated status of the IgHV gene and lack of methylation in the ZAP-70 promoter, usually result in positive ZAP-70 protein expression, which is usually associated with more aggressive disease and worse outcomes. These unfavorable genetic changes demonstrate clonal evolution, a known poor prognostic factor in CLL.

C: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm

Explanation: The findings including the computed tomographic scan, which shows a large polypoid tumor extending into the duodenal lumen primarily originating from the ampulla of Vater and involving the pancreatic head, along with the patient's symptoms of weight loss and diarrhea, are most consistent with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). This is a type of cystic neoplasm that originates within the pancreatic ducts. While mucinous cystic neoplasm and serous cystadenoma can also be found in the pancreas, they are more likely to be solitary and encapsulated, and typically not associated with the ductal system. Primary duodenal carcinoid tumor typically presents with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome when metastatic, which this patient does not have. Furthermore, the diagnostic imaging does not suggest features specific to these latter entities. Thus, IPMN is the most suitable diagnosis based on the patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.

B: Subclavian pseudoaneurysm. 

Explanation: 
Pseudoaneurysm should be suspected in patients with a pulsatile mass, bruit, and history of previous vascular surgery. The timing of this patient's symptoms, coupled with the subsequent identification of a pulsatile mass in the region of previous vascular ligation, suggests the diagnosis of a subclavian pseudoaneurysm. A pseudoaneurysm occurs when a hole in the artery allows blood to escape into the surrounding tissue. It forms a sac that fills with blood. The patient's symptoms, including a cool upper arm, cyanotic fingers, absent right-sided radial and brachial pulses, and the pulsatile mass in the chest wall all support this diagnosis. The other choices are less likely given the patient's presentation and history.

C: Check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test.

Explanation: This patient's fever and rash involving the palms and soles should raise suspicion for secondary syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can have multiple different clinical manifestations involving the skin and internal organs. The fever, rash (particularly involving the palms and soles), and symptomatic hepatitis seen in this patients are characteristic of secondary syphilis. It is worth noting that HIV infected patients are at risk of false positive RPR hence confirmation with a treponema-specific test such as FTA-ABS should be done. Syphilis can be easily treated with antibiotics once diagnosed, hence the need for immediate testing.

A: Rule out PE and perform a work up for alternative diagnoses.

Explanation: Given the patient's high Wells score, which suggests a likely pretest clinical probability of PE, and his symptomology, a CTPA was correctly performed. However, the output of the CTPA is not provided in the case summary. If the CTPA was negative, it would effectively rule out pulmonary embolism and the next steps should be aimed at identifying alternative potential causes of the patient's symptoms. These could involve cardiac, gastrointestinal, or psychiatric etiologies, given his history of anxiety, obesity, dyslipidemia, and borderline hypertension. Additionally, given the normal chest film, clear lung auscultation, and the absence of leg symptoms or swelling, the other options provided appear less likely.

B: Secondary syphilis 

Explanation: The presence of erythematous papules on the palms and soles, eroded vesicles in the oropharynx, as well as the absence of lymphadenopathy are all consistent with secondary syphilis - a systemic stage of the disease that can manifest with dermatologic findings such as a rash on the palms and soles and mucous membrane lesions. The patient's history as a man who has sex with men places him at increased risk for this sexually transmitted infection. Additionally, the use of anti-Treponema pallidum polyclonal antibody immunostain on the biopsy supports this diagnosis as Treponema pallidum is the bacterium that causes syphilis. The elevated coxsackievirus titer can be a coincidental finding or suggestive of a past infection, as a rise in titer to >1:32 is indicative of recent infection.

D: Cutaneous mucormycosis. 

Explanation: Cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection that frequently begins at the site of a skin injury, like a cut, burn, or other types of skin trauma. The fungi can then enter the skin and initiate an infection. Typically, it affects individuals with suppressed immune systems, such as this patient who had an allogenic bone marrow transplant and is living with chronic graft-vs-host disease and type 2 diabetes. The histopathological images reveal necrosis and the presence of numerous nonseptate, thick-walled fungal hyphae in the dermis, which is suggestive of mucormycosis.

D: Chilblain. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms—among them erythema, edema, burning sensation, and worsening symptoms when exposed to cold and damp environment—most accurately point towards chilblain (also known as pernio). Chilblains present as inflammatory skin lesions triggered by exposure to cold and damp environments, both of which the patient frequently encounters on his boat. His lesion's response to warmth and worsening with cold also supports this diagnosis. The biopsy results, showing thrombi within larger engorged vessels without significant vessel wall inflammation, likewise align with chilblain. This condition isn't associated with the immunofluorescence pattern seen in conditions like vasculitides. Furthermore, the lack of cartilage involvement makes relapsing polychondritis unlikely, while the absence of granulomas or systemic signs typically associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) reduces the chance of those diagnoses. Cold agglutinin disease usually presents with acrocyanosis and hemolytic anemia, not the findings seen in this patient.

C: Perform an eyelid nodule biopsy 

Explanation: Given the presentation of bilateral eyelid nodules, in combination with various systemic findings, selecting option C to perform an eyelid nodule biopsy would be the most prudent next step. Given the unusual presentation, a biopsy would offer the opportunity to further analyze the cellular makeup of the nodules, and potentially lead to a diagnosis. This seems more reasonable as an initial step rather than initiating a specific treatment such as cryotherapy or D-penicillamine without knowing the exact diagnosis. The suggestions related to the enlarged tongue offer less information about the etiology of the ocular problems. In addition, the parents denied consanguinity, so hereditary disorders are less likely.

C: Perform magnetic resonance venography

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests a cranial nerve VI palsy, the most common isolated ocular motility disturbance. In a young person, the most common cause of isolated sixth nerve palsy is presumed to be due to some form of inflammation. However, sinusitis is an uncommon cause which usually presents with other signs and symptoms of orbital involvement. 

Given the lack of these signs on the CT scan and MRI of brain and orbits besides absence of signs of raised intracranial pressure on lumbar puncture, neoplastic, and immunologic causes (including Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, giant cell arteritis, and myasthenia gravis) are less likely and hence options A and B may be unnecessary. Restarting antibiotic treatment (D) may not resolve the sixth nerve palsy since sinus drainage hasn't resolved it.

Therefore, it becomes important to rule out cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) as the cause of the sixth nerve palsy which is done by a magnetic resonance venogram (MRV). Although the condition is rare, it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of an isolated cranial nerve VI palsy, particularly when the onset is known to be recent. The possibility of CVST increases significantly in the presence of prothrombotic conditions such as infection, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and puerperium.

C: Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy

Explanation: The question describes a recurring ptosis in a young child, accompanying a severe headache, double vision, and thickening of the right third cranial nerve. This is suggestive of a form of ophthalmoplegia or, in more specific terms, Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON). RPON is rare, typically presenting in childhood with recurrent episodes of headache and ophthalmoplegia. The MRI findings also align with RPON given the thickening and enhancement of the affected cranial nerve. The nerve usually normalizes between attacks, as seen in this case. Hence, the diagnosis of Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy is fitting in this case. The other options, such as recurrent meningitis, Posterior communicating artery aneurysm, or Myasthenia do not adequately explain all presented symptoms and periods of asymptomatic phases.

C: Melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx

Explanation: The clinical pathology and histopathologic images presented support a diagnosis of melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx. First, the lesion was confined to the left torus tubarius with well-defined margins and no invasion of surrounding structures. Secondly, microscopic analysis revealed normal respiratory epithelia with oncocytic cell changes and abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, which is typical of oncocytic metaplasia. Additionally, the presence of brown pigments in the oncocytic cells cytoplasm that were negative for iron stain but positive for Fontana Masson stain supports melanin pigmentation. The low Ki-67 staining revealed a low proliferative index characteristic of benign lesions rather than malignancy. This all is against malignant melanoma or metastatic melanoma. Additionally, hemangioma is unlikely due to the absence of vascular structures in the pathology presentation. Thus, this aligns most accurately with a diagnosis of melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx.
C
1296
C: Myositis ossificans traumatica

Explanation: Myositis ossificans traumatica is a condition characterized by heterotopic ossification usually within large muscles. In this context, the patient's history of a dental abscess and unsuccessful previous oral surgery suggest a traumatic cause. Furthermore, CT images illustrate calcification in expected locations of facial muscles, supportive of this diagnosis. The growth of bone-like tissue in the muscles, a hallmark of myositis ossificans traumatica, would also account for the patient's persistent severe trismus by hindering normal muscle movement and function. Unlike lymphoma, osteosarcoma, or tumoral calcinosis, this condition aligns with the patient's clinical presentation and findings.
C
1297
C: Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms including severe headache, nasal drainage, and vision loss combined with physical examination findings such as severe left proptosis, purulent nasal drainage, nasal polypsis and computed tomographic imaging revealing extensive nasal polyposis, bony remodeling and massive erosion of the bilateral skull base and orbits suggest a severe chronic infection. Furthermore, the fact that the nasal polyps became increasingly difficult to remove implying firmness and fibrotic nature of the polyps, is a characteristic feature of invasive fungal disease. Other options like allergic fungal rhinosinusitis wouldn't be linked with such severe bony erosion and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is less likely due to the absence of typical malignant features on physical examination or imaging. Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis typically would not cause such severe symptoms or extensive bony damage.
C
1298
C: Radiation-induced neurofibroma

Explanation: The diagnosis is based on the location of the tumor, the presentation, the history of radiation exposure, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the tumor. Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that express S-100 protein, just like the tumor in this case. The woman's symptoms, such as foreign body sensation in her throat, dyspnea, and limitation of tongue movement, are correlated with the tumor's size and location in the mouth floor. Her history of radiation therapy for adenoid cystic carcinoma supports the diagnosis of a radiation-induced tumor, as radiation exposure is a known risk factor for the development of benign and malignant tumors. Additionally, the lack of cellular atypia, mitotic figures, and tumor necrosis, as well as the tumor's general structure, are consistent with the histological appearance of neurofibromas. The tumor's nonreactivity for smooth muscle actin indicates that it's not a muscle origin tumor, such as rhabdomyosarcoma or liposarcoma. The absence of recurrence of her adenoid cystic carcinoma symptoms and the tumor's morphological and immunohistochemical differences from adenoid cystic carcinoma also rule out the recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma diagnosis. Therefore, radiation-induced neurofibroma is the most plausible diagnosis.
C
1299
D: Laryngeal sarcoidosis

Explanation: The patient's history of sarcoidosis and marked swelling with patchy enhancement of supraglottic structures on CT combined with the absence of evident infection strongly suggests laryngeal sarcoidosis, a granulomatous disease that affects multiple organ systems and can cause non-caseating granulomas in any part of the body. Laryngeal involvement is relatively rare but can cause significant airway obstruction, as demonstrated by this patient. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (option A) typically presents with vocal changes and stridor but is less likely given the lack of risk factors like smoking and the histologic findings. Angioedema (option B) usually results in rapid-onset swelling, often associated with allergies and is unlikely due to the chronicity of the symptoms. Tuberculosis (option C) can cause laryngeal lesions but usually accompanies pulmonary TB symptoms, which is not the case here.
D
1300
B: Refer for ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography.

Explanation: The patient had an ocular prosthesis in one eye and is experiencing abnormal symptoms in the other, namely swelling, redness, and ptosis or drooping of the upper eyelid. These symptoms, combined with her history of breast cancer and current cervical lymphadenopathy, might indicate a more serious condition than just an infection or inflammation. An ophthalmologic examination and an orbital CT scan would therefore be more appropriate than prescribing antibiotics or recommending eyelid scrubs. These examinations can provide a comprehensive evaluation of her symptoms, reveal any abnormalities in her eye's anatomy, and potentially point to more serious conditions such as a tumor or metastases, which could be causing her symptoms.

Without appropriate medical knowledge and diagnosis tools, it's impossible for me to provide an accurate diagnosis. It would be important for the opinion of a licensed healthcare professional who has examined the patient and the clinical facts of the circumstance. However, explaining these diseases in general:

A. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system and can produce tumors throughout the body including in the abdomen, though it's more associated with swelling of lymph nodes, which doesn't seem to be the case with the description of two isolated tumors.
  
B. A Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a form of tumor that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, typically in the stomach or small intestine. However, they only occur rarely in other parts of the body.

C. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma tends to occur in the liver, and is a rare form of liver cancer that affects younger adults. 

D. A Neuroendocrine Tumor of the Pancreas is a rare form of cancer that affects hormone-producing cells within the pancreas, causing either a functional tumor producing hormones or a non-functional tumor producing no hormones.

Without further information or test results, it is not possible for me to choose a letter for diagnosis. This post is meant for educational purposes, not diagnosing medical conditions.
A: Pelvic teratoma

Explanation: Considering the age of the patient and the location and appearance of the mass on imaging, the diagnosis is likely a teratoma. Teratomas are germ cell tumors and can commonly present as a pelvic mass in young boys. They may contain several types of tissue, which explains the presence of irregularly shaped ossifications noted in the reported cystic mass. Elevated white blood cell count could be indicative of an ongoing inflammatory response due to the presence of the mass. The normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein and beta-hCG rule out other common pediatric germ cell tumors such as yolk sac tumor and choriocarcinoma.

A: Obtain a biopsy of the ulcer.

Explanation: The patient's recurring oral ulcers, despite the absence of systemic symptoms, raise suspicion for a recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), the most common cause of recurrent oral ulcers. RAS' precise etiology is unknown, but it's not infectious or contagious and doesn't respond to antibiotics or antivirals. Stress and local trauma may trigger outbreaks. While most often a clinical diagnosis, biopsy is indicated in patients with atypical findings, including a solitary, persistent ulcer (as in this patient) to rule out malignancy, an important consideration in a patient with a chronic, nonhealing mouth ulcer. Histologic features confirming RAS can guide treatment. A complete blood cell count with differential (Option C) may identify hematologic causes of oral ulcers like neutropenia or leukemia, but it's not indicated without systemic symptoms. Antibiotics and antivirals (Options B and D) aren't useful in treating RAS.

B: Obstructive abnormality with pseudorestriction 

Explanation: 
This patient's history of chronic heavy smoking, chest x-ray findings of hyperinflation, and progressive dyspnea are all indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is further supported by the spirometry results, which show a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio (<70%) indicative of airflow obstruction, and an increased total lung capacity (TLC) characteristic of hyperinflation as seen in COPD.
The low forced vital capacity (FVC) associated with a reduced FEV1 may suggest a restrictive process (termed pseudorestriction), which occurs in patients with severe COPD. The impaired expiratory airflow leads to air trapping and hyperinflation, reducing the maximum inspiratory volume and simulating restriction on spirometry. However, in true restrictive lung diseases, TLC would be reduced. Here it's abnormally high confirming the presence of hyperinflation due to obstruction, not restriction. Consequently, it's an obstructive abnormality with pseudorestriction.

B: Perform biopsy of the thymus

Explanation: The patient's significant weight loss, tremors, tachycardia, and exceptionally high thyroid hormone levels indicate she is dealing with a severe case of hyperthyroidism, likely Grave's disease given the elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin index. However, the enlarged thymus indicated by the CT and PET scans is unusual for Grave's disease and could signal another underlying condition, such as a thymoma or lymphoma. Before taking more drastic steps such as referring to oncology or surgery, a thymus biopsy would be helpful to analyze the nature of the thymus enlargement and guide the subsequent course of action.

B: Perform biopsy of the thymus 

Explanation: This clinical scenario is consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by overactive thyroid gland and symptoms such as weight loss, tremor, and tachycardia. The finding of an enlarged thymus is uncommon in Graves’ disease but can occur. A biopsy of the thymus would be appropriate at this time to rule out thymoma, a serious condition associated with myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune diseases. Also, the thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, low TSH, and high free thyroxine levels in the blood work support the diagnosis of Graves’ disease. So biopsy is important to confirm any associated thymus pathology and guide further management.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Refer to surgery for removal of the thymus

Explanation: The patient's symptoms along with the laboratory results showing significantly low TSH and high free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels suggest she has thyrotoxicosis, likely due to Graves' disease. The CT scan findings, in conjunction with the increased uptake in the thymus on the FDG-PET scan, suggest thymic hyperplasia, which is known to be associated with Graves' disease and can be mistaken for thymic neoplasm on imaging. A simple thymectomy (removal of the thymus) can resolve her dyspnea and normalize her thyroid levels, thereby lessening her thyrotoxic symptoms. Furthermore, it would eliminate the need for a biopsy or repeated scans over time. Hence, the answer is to refer to surgery for removal of the thymus.

Explanation: Infantile myofibromatosis is one of the most common fibrous tissue tumors of infancy and childhood. Based on the case, the patient's age, the pathological test results, including actin staining, and the spontaneous regression of the tumor without treatment, fits more into the description of infantile myofibromatosis. The condition is characterized by the formation of nodular lesions that commonly present at birth. While it can sometimes involve internal organs, as suggested by the cerebral and abdominal ultrasonography, this is not always the case. The marked spontaneous regression observed is also a commonly noted feature of infantile myofibromatosis. The other conditions mentioned generally do not present with these features.

A: Ecthyma gangrenosum.

Explanation: The aforementioned clinical presentation, histopathology, and the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the ulcer culture points towards the diagnosis of Ecthyma gangrenosum. It is a severe cutaneous infection usually produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its clinical appearance usually corresponds to a well-demarcated, necrotic, and deep ulcer, which was seen in the patient. Also, it often affects immunocompromised patients, which matches with this case as the patient had a medical history of heart transplant and received long-term immunosuppressive therapy. His sepsis due to P. aeruginosa also supports the diagnosis. The other options (Cytomegalovirus ulcer, Mucormycosis ulcer and Pyoderma gangrenosum) are less likely considering the patient's infections, clinical findings, and histopathological features.

C: Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma

Explanation: The woman’s age, history of chronic kidney disease, and newly identified hypercalcemia are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Skin biopsy results showing fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis are suggestive of cryoglobulinemia, a condition often associated with multiple myeloma. The skin lesions are most likely due to Type I cryoglobulinemia, which is characterized by the presence of a single type of monoclonal immunoglobulin, often IgM, and is commonly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders such as multiple myeloma. The presence of purpuric lesions on acral sites and their evolution into retiform purpuric patches with necrosis are clinical features often seen in patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculopathy. These clinical features along with the patient's laboratory results and biopsy findings favor a diagnosis of Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma.

D: Treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy.

Explanation: Given that the patient has active Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) with ocular manifestations, a combined approach of systemic treatment for the underlying WM and local intervention to address the ocular issues is most appropriate. Systemic chemotherapy can help to control the progression of WM, while pars plana vitrectomy can help in managing the vitreous hemorrhage and choroidal detachment. Hence, the combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy is the best choice to treat her condition.

D: Antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF). 

Explanation: This case of serous retinal detachment may be associated with choroidal inflammation or juvenile disciform degeneration, which suggests that abnormal choroidal vessels or increased permeability may underlie the detachment. Anti-VEGF therapy can help by inhibiting the permeability and growth of these abnormal vessels, thereby reducing the amount of fluid leakage that caused the detachment. Hence, anti-VEGF should be the next step in treatment. Note that while systemic corticosteroids might be considered given the presence of inflammatory cells, the overall clinical picture suggests a primary vascular process rather than a primarily inflammatory one. The effectiveness of photodynamic therapy and observation are generally less predictable than anti-VEGF in such cases.

1311
B: Lymphatic malformation. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a large retroperitoneal cystic mass, which is indicative of a lymphatic malformation. These are benign malformations of the lymphatic system that can occur anywhere in the body. Typically present at birth or early childhood, they can go unnoticed until they grow large enough to cause symptoms. An abscess would likely cause pain and fever, which the patient does not report. A urinoma, an encapsulated collection of urine, is typically associated with trauma, surgery, or obstruction, which is not indicated in this case. A pancreatic pseudocyst would present with symptoms of pancreatitis, which are not reported here.

1312
B: Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. 

Explanation: The patient's several months history of nasal problems with no improvement after antibiotic treatment, combined with the subsequent development of facial pain, swelling, blurred vision and weight loss suggests a chronic pathological process rather than an acute one. The computed tomographic scan details extended inflammation in the right maxillary sinus, which correlates with the presence of fungi (Aspergillus species) confirmed by biopsy. A fungal ball is typically a non-invasive fungal sinusitis and wouldn't account for the aggressive invasion and associated bony damage seen in the CT scan. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma would not account for the demonstrated fungal organisms in the biopsy. The symptoms and scan findings do not suggest a combination of conditions (fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma) simultaneously. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.
D
1313
B: Well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx. 

Explanation: The key clues to this diagnosis include the presence of a mass in the larynx composed of adipocytes of various sizes in a fibromyxoid background, as well as atypical spindle cells. Additionally, the presence of substantial nuclear staining for both CDK4 and MDM2 are commonly seen in patients with liposarcoma. Other diagnosis like Hemangioma of the larynx, Schwannoma of the larynx and Laryngocele of the larynx would not typically present with these specific morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics. Therefore, the history and findings best support the diagnosis of a Well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx.
B
1314
B: Venous malformation

Explanation: The imaging results are consistent with the diagnosis of a venous malformation. The factors indicating this include the fact that the lesion did not cause a mass effect or demonstrate surrounding edema, which would point to a benign lesion. The enhancement observed upon the administration of gadolinium also indicates the presence of slow-flow vascular channels. Also, there was maximal enhancement on the delayed postcontrast images, which is characteristic of venous malformations. Furthermore, the high intensity signal on the T2-weighted images and the signal void observed, suggest the presence of intraluminal thrombosis, which is a feature of venous malformations. The increased tracer pooling on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) further implies the presence of a slow-flow vascular lesion such as a venous malformation.
B
1315
B: Adult rhabdomyoma

Explanation: The description of the histopathological findings, including large, round-to-polygonal cells with marked eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, and centrally located vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, is most consistent with an adult rhabdomyoma. Additionally, the tumor cells were shown to be positive for myogenin, desmin, and myoglobin on immunohistochemical staining, which are characteristic markers of skeletal muscle origin that further support the diagnosis of rhabdomyoma. These tumors are most commonly found in the head and neck region and are usually benign. Other options like paraganglioma or squamous cell carcinoma would have significantly different histopathological features. Sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease, would not present as a well-defined, solitary mass.
B
1316
B: Desmoid tumor

Explanation: This patient’s history, physical examination, imaging findings, and histopathologic examination are most suggestive of a desmoid tumor (also known as aggressive fibromatosis). Desmoid tumors are a type of fibroblastic proliferation that typically arise in the deep soft tissues. They are described as locally aggressive but non-metastasizing. They are associated with trauma, pregnancy, and familial adenomatous polyposis, although they can occur spontaneously. The pathologic findings of spindle cells with plentiful collagen are consistent with fibroblastic proliferations (which include desmoid tumors and fibrosarcomas). Moreover, the strong nuclear staining for β-catenin is extremely characteristic of desmoid tumors, making the diagnosis much more likely. Despite this, it's important to note that they can behave aggressively, locally infiltrating and destroying adjacent structures, as seen in this patient. The apparent invasion of this patient's zygomatic arch, mandible and orbital floor on CT and MRI imaging highlights this feature. Other diagnoses in differential such as pleomorphic adenoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma do not typically demonstrate nuclear staining for β-catenin, helping to rule them out.
B
1317
C: Adrenal myelolipoma.

Explanation: The patient's signs and symptoms, as well as the CT scan results, point towards Adrenal myelolipoma. This is a rare, benign neoplasm of the adrenal gland. It is non-secreting and largely asymptomatic unless it grows large enough to cause pain or distension due to its size, as in this case. The typical appearance of this kind of mass on imaging often presents a mix of fat and myeloid tissue, which can hint towards this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's endocrine function tests (metanephrines, normetanephrines, cortisol, renin, and aldosterone) are all within normal limits also supports this diagnosis, as Adrenal myelolipoma is non-secreting. The mass is clearly adrenal in origin and not kidney, ruling out renal hamartoma. Lastly, Adrenal liposarcoma and nonfunctional paraganglioma are less likely given the patient's clinical characteristics and test results.
C

1318
C: Gastric duplication

Explanation: The description of a heterogeneous mass in the fundus and body of the stomach with normal gastric mucosa on biopsy is suggestive of a gastric duplication. Gastric duplications are rare congenital malformations that may not become symptomatic until adulthood. They often present with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, early satiety, or gastrointestinal bleeding and can be mistaken for a variety of gastric neoplasms. The fact that no neoplastic cells were identified on biopsy of the mass further supports the diagnosis of a benign process such as a gastric duplication. Other options are less likely as Leiomyosarcoma and Gastrointestinal stromal tumor would typically show abnormal cells on biopsy and, a Pancreatic pseudocyst would not present as a mass in the stomach fundus and body.

1319
D

Explanation: The most appropriate next step is to refer this patient to an ophthalmologist urgently for a slit-lamp and dilated examination (Option D). This patient's iris heterochromia and unilateral eyelash hypertrichosis could indicate a number of different medical issues that need to be evaluated, including but not limited to, iris melanoma, a rare eye cancer. Early detection and treatment of this disease can be vision-saving and potentially life-saving. Although options B and C may make sense if the patient's symptoms and history were slightly different, the unique combination of symptoms in this case signal a potentially serious issue that should be evaluated by a specialist as soon as possible.
B: Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion

Explanation: The patient's long-term exposure to individuals potentially carrying mycobacterium tuberculosis, his chronic signs and symptoms including his presentation of a progressive cough, dyspnea, night sweats, weight loss and his pulmonary findings of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy suggests conditions like secondary syphilis or disseminated tuberculosis. The skin lesions confined to his tattoos may be due to delayed hypersensitivity reactions. However, obtaining a biopsy of the skin lesion would help characterize the type of infiltration that could indicate granulomatous skin conditions such as cutaneous tuberculosis. Moreover, obtaining a biopsy of the skin lesion would also provide definitive diagnostic information, so it is the essential next step before further treatment or isolation measures can be considered. So the next logical step would be to obtain a biopsy of a skin lesion to confirm the diagnosis.

D

Explanation:
The patient's weight loss, nonproductive cough, fevers, night sweats, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and working with Mexican immigrants, a population with a higher prevalence of tuberculosis (TB), suggests this could be a pulmonary tuberculosis infection. The skin lesions along the tattoos might be a rare manifestation of cutaneous TB, known as "tuberculosis verrucosa cutis" or "lupus vulgaris". Also, the microscopic hematuria and hydronephrosis might indicate renal tuberculosis. Thus, it's important to perform respiratory isolation in order to prevent transmission of potentially active tuberculosis and to carry out further investigations to confirm the diagnosis. The other options (topical corticosteroids, skin biopsy and oral antibiotics) could be considered after ruling out TB.
C: Further evaluation is required; measure free testosterone.

Explanation: The patient's total testosterone levels are in the lower part of the normal range. However, symptoms of androgen deficiency can overlap with other common conditions such as obesity, diabetes and aging which this patient also presents with. A single measurement of total testosterone is not sufficient to diagnose androgen deficiency; a repeated test is required due to potential fluctuations in testosterone levels. Additionally, assessing the free testosterone is important because only around 2% of testosterone is unbound (free), and the rest is bound to sex hormone–binding globulin (and to a lesser extent albumin), and only unbound testosterone is bioavailable. So, a more accurate diagnosis could be made by measuring free testosterone levels.

A: Levamisole-induced vasculopathy 

Explanation: The patient's painful, purpuric bilateral helical lesions, retiform purpura, positive perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs), absence of cryoglobulins, and histopathologic findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis with abundant red blood cell extravasation and fibrin thrombi are features seen in levamisole-induced vasculopathy. Skin is the most frequently affected organ, with manifestations ranging from retiform purpura to extensive skin necrosis. Levamisole is an anthelmintic drug that is no longer available in the United States but continues to be used in veterinary medicine; it is also a known adulterant in approximately 80% of the US cocaine supply. Thus, clinical suspicion should be high in patients with this constellation of findings, even if they deny substance use. Other conditions such as propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and septic vasculitis had been ruled out based on her clinical presentation and medical history.
C

1323
C: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis

Explanation: The presentation of stellate red-brown patches without any induration, scale, or ulceration is most consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), which is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by infiltration of small blood vessels by neutrophils. The histopathological examination showing neutrophilic vasculitis further supports this diagnosis. LCV can be associated with systemic conditions and medication use, but no such associations are reported in this case. The symptoms of muscle cramping and numbness in the lower extremities could be due to peripheral neuropathy, which is a recognized complication of LCV. The other options (A: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, B: Microscopic polyangiitis, D: Polyarteritis nodosa) represent different forms of vasculitis that would typically present with different clinical and histopathological features.
D

1324
B: Apocrine poroma

Explanation: The dermoscopic findings of irregular pigment globules, milialike cysts, and focal arborizing vessels are typically associated with an apocrine poroma, a benign skin tumor. The lesion’s slow growth over several years and the patient's lack of other risk factors for malignancy also point toward a benign condition. An apocrine poroma is a type of sweat gland tumor that can occur on the head and neck, consistent with the location of the lesion in this case. So, the answer is B: Apocrine poroma.

1325
C: Progressive supranuclear palsy

Explanation: The patient's symptoms including balance problems, mental status changes, personality changes, decreased upgaze, rigidity and dystonic posturing in the left arm and leg, are indicative of Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by postural instability, progressive gait freezing, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, cognitive decline and changes in personality. Also, the PET scan showing frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism is consistent with PSP. PSP is typically differentiated from Parkinson's disease by absence of resting tremor and poor response to levodopa - both of which fit this patient's presentation. In addition to this, the patient's relatively advanced age and the rapid decline in her condition over the years align with the typical progression of PSP, which unfortunately, tends to decline more rapidly than other parkinsonian disorders. This, coupled with her other presenting symptoms thus leads to a diagnosis of PSP.

C: Progressive supranuclear palsy

Explanation: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including psychological changes (such as personality change, laughter/crying episodes, and subtraction problems), gait trouble and falls, dystonic posturing, dysphagia, and dysarthria. This patient's difficulty with gaze, particularly upward gaze, is a distinctive feature of PSP and strongly suggests this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient exhibits an abnormal posture in the form of decreased arm swing, dystonic posturing, and an abnormal gait. Although some symptoms of Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, and corticobasal degeneration may overlap with PSP, this specific constellation of symptoms suggests PSP as the most likely diagnosis.

C: Progressive supranuclear palsy

Explanation: The patient's symptoms including progressive gait dysfunction, imbalance, personality and judgment changes, coupled with the specific physical findings like reduced upward gaze, stiffness, abnormal posturing, and falling, are indicative of progressive supranuclear palsy. This condition is a rare neurodegenerative disease that involves changes in personality and movement, including walking and eye movements. The onset of the disease is usually around age 60, and it progresses steadily over an average of 6–10 years. The patient's age and progression of symptoms align with this pattern. The MRI and PET findings also correspond with typical findings for PSP, even though they do not definitively diagnose the condition.

Max retry attempts reached for question 1326. Skipping this question.
D: Observation.

Explanation: The blue-black flat lesion on the sclera is likely a post-treatment effect, specifically a type of pigmentation that can be seen after brachytherapy for choroidal melanoma. It does not signify tumor recurrence or treatment failure and does not require additional intervention aside from close monitoring. The B-scan ultrasonography results, showing a stable reduction in tumor height after treatment and no change or growth over the subsequent years, further support this interpretation. Immediate further treatment isn't necessary considering the overall stable clinical condition. The patient needs regular monitoring to track the lesion.

A: Discontinue treatment with chloroquine

Explanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms compatible with advanced chloroquine retinopathy. This condition is the outcome of the cumulative dose-dependent, irreversible toxicity of chloroquine on the retinal pigment epithelium. Discontinuation of chloroquine is necessary to prevent further progression of retinal damage. Even after discontinuation, the retinopathy may continue to progress, though usually at a slower pace. Subsequent management should also focus on regular ophthalmologic examinations to monitor the progression of the disease and rehabilitation to cope with visual loss. Other treatment options like intravitreous corticosteroids are not effective in this condition. The condition is not hereditary, thus, examining family members for macular dystrophy is not required. Immediate discontinuation of the medication and substitution with a less retinotoxic medication is the immediate step in management.

C: Circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris

Explanation: This patient's presentation of well-defined follicular pink papules coalescing into plaques can be associated with pityriasis rubra pilaris. Therefore, the orange-red hyperkeratosis and hyperlinearity of the palms also support this diagnosis. Although psoriasis and atopic dermatitis can present with similar symptoms, they usually do not present with such significant hyperkeratosis localized to the palms, differentiating these conditions from pityriasis rubra pilaris. And while ichthyosis can cause palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, it generally does not present with papules coalescing into plaques. Therefore, Circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris best describes this patient's condition.

B: Nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma

Explanation: The clinical and radiographic findings in the case given, combined with the histopathologic images and staining results provided strongly suggest a diagnosis of nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma. This type of cancer is extremely rare but could potentially cause similar symptoms to what the patient described. 

The tumor appeared as a well-vascularized, polypoid mass, which is common for this type of cancer. The histological analysis demonstrated a sheet-like growth of tumor cells, characteristic of the organized, nested growth patterns often seen in alveolar soft part sarcoma. 

The immunohistochemical staining results also support this diagnosis. The tumor cells were positive for smooth muscle actin, muscle-specific actin, and other markers which are also consistent with nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma. Also, the presence of branching, staghorn-like blood vessels is characteristic for this sarcoma. 

Malignant melanoma and juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma usually present somewhat different characteristics in comparison to the features presented in this case. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is another differential diagnosis but the immunohistochemical markers exhibited are more consistent with alveolar soft part sarcoma.
B
1330
B: Rhabdomyosarcoma. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation with a gradually increasing periorbital swelling, accompanied by pain and findings of a firm fixed mass with osseous destruction on imaging studies strongly suggest an aggressive malignancy. Rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma, is a common childhood cancer and often presents with symptoms like these. In comparison, metastatic neuroblastoma would show signs of generalized illness including weight loss, changes in appetite, bone pain, or even proptosis (bulging of the eye) which are not seen here.  For a diagnosis of lymphoma, one would expect systemic signs such as fevers, weight loss, and night sweats, again absent in this case. Lipomas typically do not cause bone erosion and are usually soft and movable, while in this case the mass is firm and fixed. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is rhabdomyosarcoma.
B
1331
B: Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis 

Explanation: Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNH) presents as painful, tender, inflamed nodules on the helix or antihelix of the ear. It typically occurs in middle-aged or older individuals, and is associated with pressure and friction, something that the patient's cap could have caused. The histopathological findings of a central ulcer covered by a hyperkeratotic parakeratotic scale, with surrounding epidermal hyperplasia, eosinophilic degeneration of collagen and solar elastosis are also consistent with this diagnosis. The normal underlying cartilage rules out a diagnosis of a glomus tumor or rheumatoid nodule, while the presence of a central ulcer and the absence of rapid growth make keratoacanthoma less likely.
B
1332
A: Osteolipoma

Explanation: The CT images show a well-defined mass with clear limits, and it appears to be made up of varied soft tissue components, including clear areas of fat. The slow, non-aggressive growth of the mass, its firmness, yellow color upon surgical removal, and absence of companying symptoms or other syndromic manifestations, are characteristic of lipomas. However, the case's mass displays a rare subtype of lipoma that contains osseous (bony) tissue, known as an osteolipoma. Liposarcoma (Option C) is much less likely considering the patient's age, the mass's slow growth, and the lack of aggressive features on imaging. A calcified teratoma/dermoid (Option D) could potentially mimic these radiographic findings, but these lesions often contain multiple different types of tissue and are more commonly central rather than peripheral. Myositis ossificans (Option B) generally arises in the setting of trauma or inflammation, which is not reported in this case.
A
1333
D: Primary central nervous system lymphoma. 

Explanation: The presence of abnormal intracranial enhancement, especially periventricular white matter and deep grey matter, among other areas, are more suggestive of CNS lymphoma, particularly when seen in combination with the extensive ill-defined FLAIR and T2 abnormalities. This pattern is unusual for other differential considerations such as infectious processes, other types of neoplasms, and inflammatory demyelinating processes. Furthermore, Given the demographics of the patient (older, female), the rapidly progressive clinical course within months, the insidious onset of non-specific symptoms such as depression and cognitive decline, and lack of extraneural involvement also complement a diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma. Therefore, D is the most suitable answer in this case.

1334
A: Anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation

Explanation: This patient’s symptomatology and imaging results suggest cord pathology at the thoracolumbar level. The clue to the diagnosis is the patient's clear linkage of episodes to activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, straining with urination. The increase in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures produces a caudad traction on the spinal cord, exaggerating the ventrally placed cord and causing the clinical symptoms. Both imaging studies show cord deformation from a ventrally placed lesion, confirming anterior spinal cord herniation. This condition is a rare cause of myelopathy, often leaving patients undiagnosed for many years. The herniated portion of the cord through a dural defect is driven by a pressure gradient that is exacerbated by position and changes with the Valsalva maneuver, causing episodic symptoms. Other options are less likely: a malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord would typically show enhancement with contrast that can be seen on MRI, spinal dural arteriovenous fistula usually presents with progressive myelopathy, and spinal extradural arachnoid cyst would generally not cause the episodic nature of the symptoms this patient is experiencing.

1335
A: Acute cholecystitis

Explanation: Acute cholecystitis may present with symptoms such as sudden pain in the right upper abdomen, among other symptoms. The patient's symptom of severe pain in the right upper quadrant aligns with this condition. The ultrasonography findings of an abnormal gallbladder wall thickness, as well as the CT scans showing a soft-tissue mass associated with the fundus of the gallbladder, could indicate inflammation or infection, which are consistent with acute cholecystitis. Other causes of gallbladder inflammation, such as cancer, might present with other symptoms or abnormalities in laboratory tests, which are not reported in this case. The patient's medical history of reflux is not directly related, but it signifies a history of gastrointestinal issues that could be linked to the current condition. Therefore, acute cholecystitis aligns with the combination of her symptomatology and imaging findings.

1336
A: D-dimer test result is positive. Imaging test is required.

Explanation: The D-dimer test is a type of blood test used to check if the patient might has a serious blood clot. A positive D-dimer result means that the patient has a higher-than-normal level of D-dimer in their blood. This could be due to a variety of factors, including an ongoing condition like cancer, recent surgery, or a variety of other factors. Although a positive D-dimer is common in patients with PE, D-dimer testing cannot confirm PE and is primarily used to rule out the condition. Therefore, when PE is suspected despite a low clinical probability (as indicated by the Wells score), a positive D-dimer result should lead to further diagnostic imaging tests, such as a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE.

D. Given the patient's age, activity level, and the nature of her pain, it is most likely that she is dealing with a stress fracture. It is best to start with conservative treatment measures such as pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and observation. Physical activity modification, including temporarily discontinuing the activity that caused the stress fracture, is also part of early treatment. The patient's pain should improve with these steps. However, if pain continues or worsens, further diagnostic tests may be needed to rule out more serious conditions like a bone tumor or infection. Surgery should not be the first option considered in this case.
C: Obtain antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers.

Explanation: The patient's painful, purpuric rash with vesiculation and pronounced peripheral eosinophilia suggests eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. This disease is a small-vessel vasculitis associated with asthma or allergen sensitization, peripheral eosinophilia, and extravascular eosinophils. It is essential to obtain ANCA titers in the initial evaluation, although ANCA is positive in only 40% to 60% of patients with EGPA. In EGPA, the skin, lungs, and peripheral nerves are the most commonly involved organs, but any organ can be affected. This patient's chronic respiratory symptoms, obstructive and restrictive changes on pulmonary function test, and mild bronchiectasis with ground glass opacities could potentially be attributed to EGPA instead of the initially-assumed idiopathic bronchiectasis. High-dose systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of initial therapy for EGPA, with additional immunosuppressive therapy (eg, rituximab or cyclophosphamide) utilized in severe or refractory cases.

D: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. 

Explanation: The symptoms presented such as cutaneous eruptions, fever, weakness, malaise, splenomegaly, and axillary lymphadenopathy, in combination with the patient's ethnic background, suggest a diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Additional diagnostic tests would confirm this diagnosis. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a rare cancer of the immune system's own T-cells and is caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. This virus is endemic in certain regions, including the Caribbean, where the patient is from. Other options like Sarcoidosis, Syphilis, and Indeterminate cell histiocytosis would present differently and do not match all the presented symptoms and physical findings.

C: Paraneoplastic pemphigus

Explanation: The patient’s polymorphous mucocutaneous manifestations (eg, mucositis, macules, bullae, erosions) align with a diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). PNP is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder related to malignancy, most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The diagnosis is generally confirmed by the presence of in vivo (punch biopsy) and in vitro (IIF and DIF) criteria. Characteristic histopathologic findings include acantholysis (loss of intercellular connections leading to blister formation) and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis which typically includes lymphocytes, histiocytes, and scattered eosinophils. The clinical manifestations and the results from the histopathologic examination, indirect immunofluorescence and direct immunofluorescence confirm this diagnosis. The severity of the patient's manifestations and the additional signs of underlying malignancy (adenopathy) provide further support for this diagnosis.

B: Tumid lupus erythematosus

Explanation: The answer might be Tumid lupus erythematosus considering the patient's medical history of Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the appearance, and location of the lesions, as well as their response to antibiotic treatment. Tumid lupus erythematosus is a rare, subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and is defined by erythematous, edematous, non-scarring plaques without surface changes. Often, it may be overlooked, especially in patients with a known diagnosis of SLE. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a skin biopsy showing a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate with increased dermal mucin, which is characteristic of this condition.

B: Computed tomographic scan of the orbit

Explanation: A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbit will allow for evaluation of the extent of the lesion, involve soft tissues, the presence of bone erosion, or intracranial involvement before taking any surgical measures. This will aid in determining the most appropriate next step, whether it is to be the enucleation, exenteration, or a referral for systemic management. An extremely large mass as reported certainly raises the suspicion of malignancy, but there may be microbial (fungal or atypical mycobacteria) or immune-related etiologies possible that would require very different management. Hence, while surgery might be required, a CT scan provides critical information that guides the precise surgical approach and identifies potential systemic considerations.

B: Consider a diagnosis of choroidal metastasis

Explanation:
The patient's history of breast carcinoma, alongside the findings - including the serous detachment, turbid subretinal fluid, and choroidal thickening - may suggest a possible metastatic process given the history of cancer, even though her previous annual surveillance tests were negative. Choroidal metastasis is most commonly associated with breast cancer and can occasionally present as serous retinal detachment. The absence of typical signs associated with central serous chorioretinopathy and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and absence of clinical findings suggestive of syphilitic chorioretinitis also point towards a possible choroidal metastasis. Therefore, it would be most prudent to examine this patient for a potential malignant metastatic disease.

D: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease. 

Explanation: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a common viral illness that typically affects infants and children younger than 5 years old; however, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults. It is characterized by fever, mouth sores, and a skin rash. Sometimes, it can also cause a condition known as onychomadesis, in which the nails become brittle, cracked, and may eventually fall off, which fits the symptoms presented by the child. The disease generally causes minor symptoms and typically clears up by itself in 7 to 10 days. The other options can usually be ruled out due to the absence of other symptoms associated with those conditions. For example, drug intake often comes with other side effects, Kawasaki syndrome includes symptoms like high fever and swollen lymph nodes, and a vaccination reaction would be expected to present other symptoms, such as fever or local inflammation.

D: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

Explanation: The presence of small, angulated, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, apoptosis, mitosis, and malignant glands suggest the presence of tumor cells, while the presence of round cells with eosinophilic, refractile cytoplasm and positive staining for desmin and myogenin indicate rhabdomyoblasts, which are characteristic of rhabdomyosarcoma. Specifically, the alveolar subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma is often associated with sinuses. The other options aren't as likely: Olfactory neuroblastoma typically presents with small, round, blue cells but lacks the glandular aspect and rhabdomyoblasts, sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma also presents diverse cellular features but not specific for desmin or myogenin staining, and small cell carcinoma typically lacks the rhabdomyoblastic component.

B: Lobular capillary hemangioma.

Explanation: 
The symptoms and the results from the intraoperative pathological examination and histopathology findings suggest a diagnosis of Lobular Capillary Hemangioma (LCH). LCH is a benign vascular tumor that mainly occurs on the skin but can also be located in the nasal cavity, causing nasal obstruction and epistaxis. The MRI findings and the presence of a polypoid nasal mass are consistent with this diagnosis, as is the presence of a lobulated arrangement of small capillaries surrounding a larger blood vessel (as described in the observation from the Figure B and C). Furthermore, LCH is more common in adults not juveniles, which eliminates Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma as a choice. Inverting Papilloma and Respiratory Epithelial Adenomatoid Hamartoma are typically associated with different structural and cellular presentations not described in this case. It's also important to note that LCH is often associated with the female gender and nasal obstruction, which aligns with this patient's profile and symptoms. So, the most probable diagnosis option is Lobular Capillary Hemangioma, option B.

A: Exuberant osteophytes 

Explanation: Given the finding of a bony mass causing obstructive sleep apnea in the region of the C2 vertebra, the most probable diagnosis is exuberant osteophytes. This condition is characterized by the presence of excessive bone spurs which can occur anywhere in the body but are most common in the spine. In this case, the location and the CT scan findings favor this diagnosis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis usually involves the anterior longitudinal ligament and the thoracolumbar regions. Osteochondroma and osteoid osteoma are primary bone tumors, which are usually present in the long bones and are unlikely to be found in this location.
C
1348
B: Pleomorphic adenoma

Explanation: The patient's history of a gradually enlarging, painless, firm, submucosal mass in the soft palate, with no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy or infiltration of surrounding tissue structures on imaging, is most consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign salivary gland tumors and often present as a slow-growing, painless mass. They are well-circumscribed lesions that can be easily dissected from the surrounding tissue, as in this case. Infiltration of surrounding structures, painful symptoms, and presence of cervical lymphadenopathy would be more indicative of a malignant process such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Hemangiomas typically have characteristic imaging findings of high blood flow, which is not mentioned in this case. Granular cell tumors, while benign, are typically small and often cause overlying mucosal changes, which is not evident in this case.

B: Extramammary Paget disease

Explanation:
The combination of pruritus, location of the rash, chronic course, absence of response to steroids and morphology of the lesion – all are characteristic features of Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD). Although EMPD is a rare condition, it primarily affects areas rich in apocrine glands such as the inguinal and genital areas as seen in this patient. Furthermore, the patient's history of prostate cancer and melanoma may suggest an increased likelihood of developing further malignant conditions, such as EMPD. It is also worth noting that other conditions such as Bowen's disease, lichen sclerosis and fungal infections can also present with similar manifestations. However, given the chronicity, failure of the lesion to respond to steroids, the history of malignancies and specific characteristics of the lesion - EMPD remains most likely. Nevertheless, definitive diagnosis should always be confirmed by a skin biopsy.

C: Polycystic liver disease

Explanation: The patient's history of polycystic kidney disease and the symptoms he presented, which include malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, early satiety, and abdominal distention, are all indicative of polycystic liver disease (PLD). Additionally, the presentation of the giant multinodular mass in the upper abdomen could be a result of numerous cysts in the liver which is a common characteristic of PLD. The presence and growth of these cysts tends to cause an increased liver volume which could account for the patient's extreme discomfort and abdominal distention. Although renal transplantation could theoretically prompt de novo kidney graft tumor, the image and symptoms provide stronger evidence toward PLD.

D: Echinococcal disease. 

Explanation: Echinococcal disease can result in cysts in the organs like the spleen and liver. In this case, the patient's history of having been in close proximity to dogs and consuming sheep meat, both of which are key sources of the Echinococcus parasite can be factors contributing to her condition. The formation of large cysts with calcified capsules in the spleen are key characteristics of Echinococcal disease. Even though the Echinococcus antibody IgG test came out negative, it's possible that the disease is still in its early stages or the test results might be false negatives. Therefore, in this context, Echinococcal disease appears to be the most likely diagnosis, even though more tests are required for a complete confirmation.

1352
B: The patient has euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of hydration status (moist mucous membranes, normal blood pressure, unspecified jugular venous pressure, and absence of peripheral edema), combined with her laboratory values, it seems she is not hypervolemic (overhydrated) or hypovolemic (dehydrated). Hence, euvolemia (normal fluid volume) is left by exclusion.

The term "hypotonic" refers to the reduced concentration of solutes in the body fluid, thus, hyponatremia (low sodium level) indicates that the sodium level in the patient's blood is lower than normal. This could be due to the patient's medical history (glioma and the subsequent treatments, anterior hypopituitarism, use of certain medications), as well as her recent addition of haloperidol, which can also contribute to hyponatremia.

Her abdominal pain could be a symptom of hyponatremia, as low sodium can impact the function of muscles and nerves. Maintaining electrolyte balance is important for proper function of the heart, liver, kidney and brain. It is crucial to correct the hyponatremia, but the approach would depend on its underlying cause which might be her glioma-surgery sequela or a medication side effect.

C: Perform skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence

Explanation: Given the described history and physical findings, along with the history of dermatitis herpetiformis diagnosis, the patient needs a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide the appropriate treatment. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, intensely itchy blistering skin condition that is usually associated with celiac disease. Confirmation of the diagnosis involves showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the dermal papillae of perilesional skin on direct immunofluorescence. Hence, performing a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence is an integral part of diagnosis and further treatment of this patient.

D: The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function.

Explanation: The description given suggests the presence of severe aortic stenosis depicted by the harsh late-peaking systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, soft A2, and the delays in the carotid upstrokes. The description also mentions that the systolic function of the left ventricle is preserved which is consistent with the clinical scenario of severe aortic stenosis. The patient's age and comorbidities also align with the common occurrence of aortic stenosis in older patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The presence of a diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border also suggests aortic regurgitation, often associated with aortic stenosis. Despite the presence of a holosystolic murmur at the apex which suggests mitral regurgitation, there is no compelling evidence provided that the patient has a dilated cardiomyopathy or that the Doppler measurements have overestimated the severity of stenosis.

B: Perform lumbar puncture with patient in upright position to measure opening pressure and examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) components

Explanation: The patient’s presentation is indicative of papilledema, which is a condition characterized by swelling of the optic nerves due to increased intracranial pressure. The presence of bilateral optic disc swelling, peripapillary hemorrhages, and an absence of venous pulsations are typical findings. Based on these symptoms, the logical next step would be to perform a lumbar puncture in order to measure the CSF opening pressure. This will help to identify or rule out conditions like idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which typically presents with such symptoms. Other abnormalities in CSF may also shed light on potential underlying conditions. MRI or MRV imaging is also necessary, but in this case, the immediate focus should be on evaluating intracranial pressure, hence the choice of lumbar puncture as the next diagnostic step.

1356
B: Fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine

Explanation: The history of self-administered injections of meperidine, clinical examination of physical features involving the muscle contractures, ulceration, fibrosis and induration along with laboratory findings can direct to a diagnosis of fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine. Prolonged and frequent use of meperidine, especially with subcutaneous injections, can lead to local tissue necrosis and fibrosis due to its caustic nature. Pyoderma gangrenosum is usually associated with systemic diseases, which the patient doesn't seem to have. A localized scleroderma (morphea) is a possibility, but it is primarily a disease of the skin and underlying tissue not directly linked to self-injection behavior or associated with such ulceration. Lastly, his culture samples tested negative for mycobacteria, ruling out Mycobacterium haemophilum infection.

B: Condyloma lata

Explanation: Pedunculated, or stalk-like growths on the skin, are highly suggestive of genital warts (Condyloma acuminata). However, this patient's rash involvement and positive immunohistochemical staining for spirochetes favors the diagnosis of Condyloma lata, which is one of the secondary signs of syphilis. The macerated appearance can be commonly seen in Condyloma lata due to its location in intertriginous, or friction-prone, areas. Spirochetes are a key pathological agent in syphilis, and thus, a positive immunohistochemical staining would highly suggest this diagnosis. Other options such as Verrucous herpes simplex virus can show epidermal hyperplasia but do not usually present as such a pedunculated nodule and Granuloma inguinale does not typically show a predominance of lymphocytes and plasma cells.

B: Primary oral histoplasmosis

Explanation: In this case, the key findings that support the diagnosis of primary oral histoplasmosis include the presence of a non-healing, ulcerated lesion on the tongue with a clean base, no bleeding or friability, and no history of tobacco or alcohol use. Histopathologically, the presence of intracellular yeast forms within histiocytes is characteristic of histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum and is quite rare in India. Primary oral histoplasmosis can present as a non-healing ulcer in the oral cavity. The disease typically affects individuals with altered immune status, but can also occur in individuals with diabetes mellitus. This case is unusual in that histoplasmosis is primarily a pulmonary disease and oral manifestations are rare, even in endemic areas.

B: Advance-and-cut technique: rotate the hook anterogradely, clip the barb, and back out the hook retrogradely through the entry wound. 

Explanation: In this case, the advance-and-cut technique might be the most effective because it allows for safe disengagement of the barb without further damage to ocular structures. This procedure involves rotation of the hook in the same direction it entered, followed by clipping of the barb and subsequent retrograde removal. Other techniques run the risk of causing further damage by either retraction through already damaged tissue (back-out technique) or creation of further entry or exit wounds (needle-cover and cut-and-push-through techniques). However, the approach should always be individualized depending on the specifics of each case.

B: Magnetic resonance imaging and/or venography

Explanation: Given the patient's history and presentation, the optimal initial step would be to undertake brain imaging in the form of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and/or venography to exclude causes such as central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms or other vascular abnormalities which could cause these symptoms. Lumbar puncture could be considered following these results, to examine cerebrospinal fluid for signs of inflammation or infection. Intravenous vitamin therapy and corticosteroids could potentially be helpful, but the ultimate choice of treatment would depend on the underlying cause identified from the imaging studies.

1361
B: Tracheoesophageal fistula

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of choking with feeds and copious clear oral secretions requiring frequent suctioning, along with a history of difficult intubation, raises the suspicion of tracheoesophageal fistula. This condition is a congenital anomaly in which there is an abnormal communication between the esophagus and trachea. The fluoroscopic video swallowing study further supports this diagnosis as it can reveal contrast entering the trachea during swallowing. This condition can lead to repeated bouts of aspiration, pneumonia, and feeding difficulties. It would explain the noted symptoms more accurately than gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal perforation, or simple aspiration which lack the necessary correlation with all the presented symptoms and clinical history of this neonate. Immediate medical attention and surgical correction are needed for this condition.

A: Carcinoma of the gallbladder 

Explanation: The presence of a greatly enlarged gallbladder with a thickened wall, hypoattenuated intramural nodule, and perihepatic lymph nodes on imaging, along with the patient's history of significant weight loss, abdominal pain, and elevated C-reactive protein level, are suggestive of carcinoma of the gallbladder. While acute cholecystitis can also present with abdominal pain and a positive Murphy sign, it would typically not result in a greatly enlarged or thickened gallbladder and wouldn't cause such dramatic weight loss over an extended period. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and lymphoma are less likely given the imaging findings and the patient's clinical presentation.

1363
D: Ovarian cyst with torsion. 

Explanation: The described clinical presentation and radiographic findings strongly suggest the diagnosis of ovarian cyst with torsion. The abdominal distention, vomiting, and small-bowel obstruction, in combination with unilateral labial swelling and evidence of an intra-abdominal fluid collection on imaging, are highly suspicious of an ovarian cyst with torsion. Although other causes of bowel obstruction in neonates such as cecal duplication or small-bowel volvulus may present with similar symptoms, they typically do not cause unilateral labial swelling. Additionally, the existence of ganglion cells on rectal biopsy excludes the possibility of Hirschsprung’s disease, another common cause of neonatal bowel obstruction. Lastly, infantile leiomyosarcoma is a rare condition and often presents with a palpable abdominal mass and other systemic symptoms, which were not evident in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an ovarian cyst with torsion.

B: The patient has lactic acidosis from lymphoma. 

Explanation: Lactate is a byproduct of cellular metabolism, and its levels can be elevated in conditions where the tissues are oxygen-starved, such as sepsis and shock. However, this patient is afebrile and normotensive, and his abdominal examination results have remained unchanged, thus ruling out options A, C, and D. Lactate elevation can also occur in patients with lymphoma, potentially due to production by the tumor itself or impaired hepatic clearance of lactate. Given the patient's advanced refractory lymphoma and the lack of other causes for lactate elevation, it is most plausible he has lactic acidosis due to his lymphoma.

D: Observe and provide supplemental oxygen.

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests an event of aspiration during the choking episode causing aspiration pneumonia, leading to her respiratory distress. However, the chest radiograph and a computed tomographic scan of the chest do not necessarily show pneumonia, an infection that would require antibiotics and resuscitation mentioned in option A. Moreover, there is no indication of bronchospasm to support the use of β2-agonist nebulizers and steroids as in option B. The patient's ECG is normal and she has preserved systolic function with no evidence of valve disease making option C less likely. Thus, the most appropriate next step is to simply observe and provide supplemental oxygen as needed (option D).

1366
C: Order computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 

Explanation: Given the age and the ongoing unexplained weight loss experienced by the patient, it would be smart to perform an extensive examination to diagnose potential underlying diseases which might be causing the symptoms. Considering the array of symptoms presented out of which some are characteristic of several types of cancer, and since the patient also has lost significant weight - often associated with cancer - more exhaustive imaging such as CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be deemed necessary. This would allow for internal visualizations that might indicate malignancies or other underlying conditions. Answers A and B are more appropriate for symptomatic treatments when a clear diagnosis has been established. Although HIV may cause unusual skin manifestations and weight loss, it's less likely when considering the age and background of the patient. Thus, the investigation in the direction of possible malignancies seems to be more prudent here; however, lab results should dictate the next steps in diagnosis.

C: Hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert syndrome

Explanation: The patient's asymptomatic isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia is most likely due to Gilbert syndrome, which is a benign condition characterized by intermittent and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia often observed in times of stress, fasting, dehydration, or illness. Total bilirubin levels typically do not exceed 6 mg/dL and liver function and histology are otherwise normal. About 7% to 10% of the population has this common condition and is often discovered during routine testing. Chronic liver disease and splenomegaly are typically absent, and indirect bilirubin is the predominant fraction. Cholelithiasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, and hemolysis are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings.

Without having the necessary medical data, imagery, or knowledge to make an accurate diagnosis, it's impossible for me to provide a valid answer. I recommend consulting a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and explanation.
D: Peeling skin disease. 

Explanation: The presence of superficial erosions and erythematous residual macules yet no history of blistering, along with the child's ability to peel off skin with marked facility suggest the diagnosis of peeling skin syndrome (PSS). PSS is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by superficial skin peeling. Patients typically present in early infancy or childhood with painless, continual, spontaneous skin peeling, with exacerbations often related to heat, rubbing, or friction, which also agrees with the case description.

D: Burkitt lymphoma of the breast.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms like persistent mastitis without improvement after antibiotics, significant drop in hemoglobin level and platelet count, along with the presence of systemic symptoms such as back pain, paresthesias, and diplopia, suggest a systemic disease and not merely an inflammation or infection of the breast, pointing towards lymphoma. Out of the given options, Burkitt lymphoma of the breast fits the symptoms and histopathological specimen from biopsy. Burkitt lymphoma is associated with rapid growth, often presenting as a large mass with systemic symptoms, which could include neurological manifestations like diplopia and paresthesias due to the tumorous involvement of the central nervous system.

B: Brain imaging and echocardiography 

Explanation: The presence of hypopigmented macules along with retinal astrocytic hamartoma points towards a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a genetic disorder affecting multiple systems. In this condition, benign tumors can form in vital organs such as the brain, heart (requiring potential echocardiography), eyes, skin, kidneys, and lungs. Brain imaging is commonly used to detect these tumors (often called tubers when in the brain) and to monitor their size over time. The absence of calcification, retinal detachment, and choroidal involvement on ultrasonography suggests benign rather than malignant processes, making a metastatic workup or a biopsy less urgent. TSC can also potentially involve the kidneys, but renal ultrasound may not be the immediate priority in a neonate with neurological and cutaneous manifestations.

1372
B: Check antinuclear antibody level

Explanation: The patient's symptoms such as recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages and retinal vascular abnormalities accompanied by rare anterior chamber cells and bilateral vitreous cells, indicate a possible autoimmune or inflammatory process affecting the retina and other eye structures. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is used to help determine if the patient has an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. While hyperlipidemia and arthritis are present which could affect small vessels, the presence of cells in the vitreous and signs of inflammation in the vessels are not typically associated with these conditions. The ANA level will provide a clue as to whether there is a systemic autoimmune process that could explain the eye findings. Other choices such as blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c will be helpful if the patient had features of hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy, which is not the case here. Check erythrocyte sedimentation rate will also be helpful in determining inflammatory conditions but ANA level will give more specific information regarding autoimmune conditions.

B: Kerion celsi

Explanation: Kerion celsi which is also known as a kerion, is an inflammatory type of tinea capitis (scalp ringworm) that presents as a painful, boggy and inflamed mass, discharging pus. The condition is commonly associated with a fungal infection caused by dermatophytes. In this case, multiple cues point towards this diagnosis, such as: the boy's initial annular, scaly patches on scalp and upper back, which are classically associated with fungal skin infection; these patches appearing in his siblings, indicating the contagious nature of the condition; the large, tender scalp nodule with associated hair loss; and the lastly, the yellow suppurative discharge visualized which indicates a secondary bacterial infection, a complication of the kerion. Abscess and dissecting cellulitis can present similarly, but lack some of the distinctive features of a kerion (like the annular patches); mycobacterial infections usually don’t present as rapidly progressing tender nodules and are less likely to be associated with scalp ringworm.

C: Retroperitoneal sarcoma. 

Explanation: The presentation of the patient primarily points towards a diagnosis of retroperitoneal sarcoma. The symptoms, physical examination, negative findings on colonoscopy and mammography, alongside the location, size, and characteristics of the mass on imaging, align best with this diagnosis. This type of sarcoma often presents as a painless, enlarging abdominal or flank mass, and can involve surrounding anatomic structures, as seen in this case. Other options such as lymphoma or primary neoplasm arising from the kidney usually present alongside other systemic or urinary symptoms. Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst is rare and would typically demonstrate mostly cystic, rather than mixed solid-cystic, composition.

B: Stent perforation

Explanation: The patient's condition following the stent placement procedure — generalized peritonitis and abundant free air seen in computed tomography — suggest a perforation. While the patient indeed has colon cancer, the current symptoms strongly imply a post-procedure complication, making stent perforation the most probable diagnosis. Mesenteric ischemia and perforated diverticulitis would typically present with different symptoms and the patient's medical record doesn't provide evidence to support these as the diagnoses.

D. Perform a skin scraping with microscopy. 

Explanation: Considering the patient's diagnosis of AIDS, it is critical to consider opportunistic infections as the potential cause of his skin manifestations. The crusted and verrucous character of the patient’s plaques could indicate the presence of fungal, parasitic, or bacterial infections, especially in the context of severe immunosuppression. Option D, performing a skin scraping with microscopy, is essential for the confirmation of an infectious etiology. Microscopic examination may reveal the presence of fungal elements, ectoparasites, or bacteria. Although the patient has psoriasis, prescribing a topical corticosteroid without definitive diagnosis can potentially exacerbate the existing infection. Syphilis can present with various skin manifestations, but the morphology of the rash in syphilis is typically different from the rash observed in this patient. Finally, prescribing a topical antifungal would be appropriate only if a fungal infection was confirmed. Therefore, a skin scraping for microscopy is the most suitable next step in the management of this patient.
B: The patient likely has sepsis, possibly with an uncontrolled infectious source that requires further workup. 

Explanation: The patient's presenting symptoms - cough, fever, anorexia, malaise, hypotension, tachycardia, severe respiratory distress, increase in lactate levels - are all common indicators of sepsis. Despite interventions such as antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors, his condition deteriorated, and lactate levels continually increased, showcasing a persisting underlying infection that is not yet controlled. In addition to this, his previous medical conditions, including coronary artery disease and cirrhosis, make him more susceptible to conditions like sepsis. The increase in lactate could be due to an uncontrolled source of infection, warranting additional diagnostic workup. Though other explanations could contribute to his current condition, the clinical overview points towards sepsis.

A

Explanation: The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a lipid panel. This patient's presentation—nonpruritic bright pink papules with a central yellow hue arrayed on extensor surfaces in a symmetrical pattern—is most consistent with eruptive xanthomas. They characteristically appear on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, buttocks, and less commonly, on the face. Onset is usually heralded by mild burning pain or tenderness. Eruptive xanthomas are a cutaneous manifestation of hypertriglyceridemia (usually >2000 mg/dL [>22.6 mmol/L]) that most commonly occurs in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, or, very rarely, as a drug reaction. Given this patient's obesity and family history of type 2 diabetes, it is likely that he has undiagnosed diabetes mellitus contributing to significantly elevated triglycerides. Therefore, a lipid panel is warranted. Other management for this patient should include glucose control; if triglycerides remain >1000 mg/dL (>11.3 mmol/L), drug therapy to reduce risk of pancreatitis should be considered.
C: This audiogram depicts a right-sided SNHL and impaired speech discrimination, which necessitate further investigation.

Explanation: The patient's reported symptoms, combined with the results of the Weber and Rinne tests, suggest an abnormality localized to her right ear. The significant difference between the patient's ears revealed on the audiogram, as well as the observed speech discrimination deficit on her right side, point toward a sensorineural source for her hearing difficulties. A major factor pointing to a sensorineural etiology is the absence of any history of otologic disease or trauma; while both Meniere disease and otosclerosis could theoretically mimic these audiometric findings, both are unlikely given the patient's clinical history. In this case, further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the causes of the patient's hearing issues.

The answer is B: Pancreatic panniculitis.

Explanation: Pancreatic panniculitis, a rare cutaneous manifestation of pancreatic disease, occurs in 2%-3% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma and less frequently in patients with pancreatitis. The characteristic presentation includes erythematous, tender subcutaneous nodules, typically located on the lower extremities. These nodules may ulcerate and drain an oily, brownish discharge. Diagnosis is confirmed by the histopathologic presence of 'ghost cells' - necrotic fat cells with a finely granular, basophilic nuclear debris. Other notable findings can include an elevated serum lipase or amylase levels. In this patient, the abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms further suggest an underlying pancreatic disorder as the cause of the skin findings. Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying pancreatic disease.

C: Cutaneous cholesterol embolism

Explanation: Cutaneous cholesterol embolism, also known as cholesterol embolization syndrome, is a potentially severe condition caused by cholesterol crystal emboli that occlude small arteries. The needle-shaped clefts within the lumen of a blood vessel from the biopsy specimen are cholesterol clefts, a defining feature of cholesterol emboli. This condition is often associated with procedures such as endovascular stenting, which was a part of this patient's medical history, and may occur spontaneously in patients with severe atherosclerotic disease. The necrosis and perivascular inflammation shown in the eccrine ducts of the biopsy specimen are also common findings in cutaneous cholesterol embolism. Warfarin necrosis, Calciphylaxis and Intravascular B-cell lymphoma do not typically present with these specific histological findings.

C: Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid

It usually occurs in older persons and may be associated with various systemic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both of which the patient has. The histologic evidence showing inflammation and bulla formation with eosinophils is consistent with dyshidrosiform pemphigoid. Additionally, the negative medication history and local skin changes are not strongly suggestive of other differential diagnoses such as bullous tinea pedis, allergic contact dermatitis, or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.

D: Refer to otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy.

Explanation: The man's symptoms, including persistent eye redness and pain, along with the presence of an intranasal mass, are indicative of a possible systemic inflammatory or neoplastic condition, not just an ocular issue. Specific test results such as elevated inflammatory markers, despite normal results for other potential causes of inflammation such as ANCA, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody, further suggest the possibility of a systemic issue. Therefore, addressing only the eye symptoms with increased corticosteroids or an injection would likely not address the underlying condition. Biopsy of the nasal mass could provide crucial information for diagnosis and forming a comprehensive treatment plan. Referral to an otolaryngologist for this procedure would be the appropriate next step.

B: Serum antibody titer

Explanation: The presence of the unilateral swollen nerve, the blurring vision improving within a week, and the exposure to cats suggest a possible case of neuroretinitis, which is often linked with a Bartonella henselae infection (the bacteria responsible for cat-scratch disease). Therefore, a serum antibody titer test might help in establishing or ruling out this diagnosis. Diagnostic neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis might not be necessary given the absence of central nervous system symptoms. Blood culture analysis is usually not useful since B. henselae is difficult to culture. Therefore, the preferred next step would be a Bartonella henselae antibody titers test.

B: Neonatal lupus erythematosus 

Explanation: Neonatal lupus erythematosus matches the symptoms described. It is autoimmune in nature and although there was no known family history of autoimmune disease, it could be a possibility. The annular plaques along with faintly pink patches with scaling on the medial eyebrows and mesolabial folds are indicative of the neonatal lupus erythematosus. Though the mother denies any symptoms, it is possible she may be asymptomatic. Granuloma annulare or Tinea capitis generally present differently from what is described. Annular urticaria usually comes with reactions to food or drugs, environmental triggers or infections, none of which were reported in this case.

B: Free-floating arterial thrombus. 

Explanation: The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both risk factors for carotid artery disease, combined with her symptoms, make a diagnosis of a free-floating arterial thrombus likely. Symptoms like transient ischemic attacks, a minor stroke with right-sided weakness, slurred speech and facial droop, as well as the findings of large infarctions in the left frontal and parietal hemispheres, are indicative of this condition. A 95% stenosis of the left ICA is consistent with this diagnosis as well, as it could be the source of a thrombus.

D

Explanation: The patient's findings of hypercalcemia and increased parathyroid hormone level are suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). PHPT is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients. Clinical features can include constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue, depression), nephrolithiasis, and bone disease (eg, fractures, bone pain); however, most patients are asymptomatic, with hypercalcemia detected incidentally on laboratory testing. The diagnosis is supported by a high or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Her elevated PTH level in the presence of hypercalcemia establishes the diagnosis of PHPT. The parathyroid glands in the neck area are the location where hormone production is high. Therefore, thyroidectomy would not affect parathyroid function unless the parathyroid glands were inadvertently removed or damaged during operation. Nonetheless, PHPT can develop many years after thyroidectomy due to other reasons, including sporadic parathyroid adenomas.
A: Perform skin biopsy for histopathology and culture.

Explanation: The patient presents with a severe skin infection and cavitary lung lesions, indicating a systemic involvement. His history of drug use, gardening, and pet dogs can point to possible infectious sources. A skin biopsy for histopathology and culture could potentially identify the underlying organism behind the patient's condition. While intravenous antibiotics (B) might seem like the next best step due to the severity of his symptoms, a diagnosis should be established before such a broad-spectrum approach is undertaken. Topical treatments (C, D) are inappropriate as they do not match the severity of his symptoms and systemic involvement. Therefore, the first step should be a biopsy to guide further treatment.

B

Explanation: 
This patient's presentation is consistent with a fixed drug eruption (FDE) due to diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). FDE is a type of cutaneous drug eruption that recurs at the same site or sites each time a particular drug is taken. Lesions typically appear within hours to a day of drug exposure and initially manifest as well-circumscribed, round, or oval patches of erythema and edema that subsequently become dusky violaceous and may develop a central blister. The most common sites of involvement are the lips, extremities, and genitalia, but any skin or mucus membrane site can be affected.
The offending drug must be identified and discontinued in patients with FDE because lesions may increase in size and number with subsequent exposures. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to discontinue the diclofenac.
C: Dermatitis herpetiformis. 

Explanation: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a skin condition characterized by a chronic, intensely itchy, blistering rash, typically in a symmetrical distribution most commonly affecting the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Manifestations can also include less common variants, such as localized DH, which seems to be the case with the patient. DH is histopathologically characterized by neutrophils within dermal papillae, as shown in the biopsy. Direct immunofluorescence showing granular IgA deposition at the dermoepidermal junction is pathognomonic for DH. The patient's intermittent bloating and diarrhea may suggest undiagnosed or subclinical celiac disease, which is strongly associated with DH. The persistent nature of the lesions and their lack of correlation with the patient’s blood glucose finger stick also hint at this diagnosis.

The answer is C: Amyloidosis.

Explanation: The clinical features presented align with the localized cutaneous type of amyloidosis, known as Nodular Localized Cutaneous Amyloidosis (NLCA). This condition can often produce dystrophic nails and easy bruising, mainly due to amyloid infiltration into the dermis layer of the skin and nails, causing disruptions in their structure and function. The histopathologic result showing orange, amorphous, and extracellular material deposited in the subungual dermis of the nail bed, with intense apple-green birefringence under polarized light is a classic sign of amyloidosis. Lichen planus of the nails likely wouldn't show these histological features, sarcoidosis involves granulomas, and alopecia areata wouldn't account for the patient's skin presentations.

C: Fusarium and Mucormycosis

Explanation: The physical signs, including black plaques and white nodules, described in this severely burned patient are indicative of a fungal infection. The histopathological images (especially those with Hematoxylin-eosin and Gomori methenamine silver stains) imply an invasive mycoses, likely fungal hyphae which suggest moulds. The moulds Fusarium and Mucormycosis are quite aggressive and can notably manifest as necrotic lesions or plaques, and frequently occur in patients with severe burns or immunocompromised conditions. Additionally, these fungi often present a quick onset of symptoms and can lead to severe complications if not timely treated, which would explain the rapid deterioration of this patient's condition. Neither Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas nor Cryptococcus and Penicillium are typically associated with the presentation described. While Candida and Aspergillus could be possible, they usually don't form black plaques and white nodules like Fusarium and Mucormycosis. Therefore, given the clinical scenario and histopathological findings, Fusarium and Mucormycosis is the most likely diagnosis.

A: Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging)

Explanation: The case describes a relatively fast-growing papillomatous lesion in the eye of an otherwise healthy girl. While topical steroid treatment may help reduce inflammation and symptoms, it is not likely to address the underlying cause of a swiftly growing mass. With such symptoms, the girl would be best served with further diagnostic evaluations such as orbital imaging. The MRI can help determine the extent of the lesion and rule out any intracranial or intraorbital extension which would guide the steps to consider in the subsequent treatment. It is also crucial to rule out any possible malignancy by further examination, given the rapid growth of the mass. It is also crucial to stress here that any treatment decision made should be based on the advise of an ophthalmologist after thorough consultation and diagnosis.

C: Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment, with or without concomitant needle biopsy

Explanation: Given the presence of a lesion that may have slightly grown over time along with a small area of retinal detachment, an episcleral radioactive plaque treatment with or without a concomitant needle biopsy would be the most appropriate course of action. This procedure can treat the lesion while also allowing for pathological analysis if a biopsy is performed. Options such as an excisional or incisional biopsy might be less favorable due to potential complications and impact on ocular function. Observing without any intervention might not be the best choice given the possible progression of the lesion. However, the exact next step should ideally be decided after consulting with the patient and considering her preferences, overall health status, and the potential risks and benefits of the available options.

B: Streptobacillus moniliformis infection

Explanation: The patient's exposure to a rodent-infested environment and the symptoms reported: fever, rash, and diffuse pain, including arthralgia, lead to the conclusion of Streptobacillus moniliformis infection, otherwise known as rat-bite fever. This type of infection is often associated with rodent exposure and can present with the combination of fever, rash, and polyarthralgia, as seen in this patient. While the other options could potentially explain some aspects of the patient's condition, Streptobacillus moniliformis infection best accounts for all the details provided, including the petechiae and pustules found on the palms and soles.

B: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with central necrosis. 

Explanation: The weight loss along with the presence of an immobile non-tender mass in the upper abdomen are signs of a possible tumor. In addition, the reported severe halitosis could be due to necrotic tissue associated with the tumor. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors often present with nonspecific symptoms including abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and, rarely, a palpable mass. The CT image showing a large central necrotic mass further supports this diagnosis. GISTs with central necrosis are seen in larger and high-grade tumors where the center outgrows its blood supply leading to necrosis. Other options are less likely given the described symptoms, tests and imaging results.

B: Meckel diverticulum

Explanation: Meckel's diverticulum, a congenital abnormality resulting from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric duct, is the most common anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in about 2% of the population. It can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in children, from heterotopic gastric mucosa that secretes acid. In this case, the presence of an outpouching in the distal ileum, accompanied by an ulceration, is suggestive of Meckel's diverticulum. Despite modern imaging techniques, preoperative diagnosis is often elusive, as exemplified in this case. A multipronged endoscopic approach (including retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy) can aid in the diagnosis of obscure gastrointestinal hemorrhage when standard methods fail. Treatment is surgical resection.

C: Lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen

Explanation: The patient's symptoms along with the CT scan data suggest that there may be an internal hernia in the lesser sac, which might be causing the right upper quadrant pain. The lack of nausea or vomiting, consistency of the pain interval, and no past abdominal surgery all tie into the characteristics of an internal hernia through the epiploic foramen. Also, the CT imaging shows the border of the epiploic foramen and the cecum in the lesser sac, indicating a possible hernia. Other options such as an abscess or a perforated ulcer would lead to a higher white blood cell count and increased C-reactive protein level due to an infection or inflammation, but these levels are normal in this patient. A diverticulum is usually accompanied by other symptoms and complications that are not apparent in this case.

1399
B: The patient most likely has monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, coupled with the positive results from the serum protein electrophoresis, suggest the presence of a monoclonal protein, or M-protein. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition where there is an excess of this protein, but without symptoms of multiple myeloma or related diseases. This is the most common type of plasma cell disorder and often doesn't cause problems or require treatment. The nemal findings on the complete blood cell counts, serum calcium, and creatinine make multiple myeloma less likely. Likewise, the absence of anemia, hyperviscosity symptoms, and large amounts of IgM protein makes Waldenström macroglobulinemia unlikely. Finally, the absence of organ damage due to the deposition of light chains in tissues makes light chain monoclonal gammopathy also unlikely.

B: Prescribe systemic corticosteroids.

Explanation: The woman's rapidly progressing painful leg ulceration, alongside her recent diagnosis of Crohn disease and other symptoms like the dense neutrophil infiltration and vascular fibrinoid necrosis identified in histopathology, as well as her non-responsiveness to broad-spectrum antibiotics, might suggest pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). PG is a neutrophilic dermatosis that can be associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. PG lesions often present as painful ulcers with violaceous borders and can progress rapidly. This patient's negative infectious workup and lack of vascular abnormalities also favor PG. Systemic corticosteroids are typically the first line of treatment for PG, often resulting in dramatic improvement. Therapy such as intralesional corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or biologics may also be considered in some cases. Implementing daily dressings and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, surgically excising the lesion, or continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics may not address the underlying problem if indeed she suffers from PG, making systemic corticosteroids a viable next step.

D: Type II non–ST-elevation MI related to acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand.

Explanation: The patient presented with hypertensive emergency and evidence of end organ damage, such as cTnT elevation, but no obstructive coronary artery disease was identified, which is consistent with a diagnosis of type II MI. Type II MI occurs when there is a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, as may occur with significant hypertension. While there is an ongoing discussion about the classification of type II MI and how it should be managed differently from type I MI, it is clear that the precipitating condition (in this case, hypertensive emergency) should be treated. Furthermore, chronically elevated cTnT due to LVH may occur, but it is unlikely to cause acute symptoms. Type I MI is unlikely as coronary angiography did not reveal any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Lastly, elevated cTnT due to skeletal muscle injury is unlikely in the absence of significant muscle injury or disease.

A

Explanation: The patient's history, lack of symptoms, and positive syphilis serologies are consistent with latent syphilis. The diagnosis of syphilis is a bit complex, involving both treponemal and non-treponemal serologic tests. Treponemal tests (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TPPA]) detect antibodies to T pallidum antigens. Non-treponemal tests (eg, venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL], rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) detect antibodies to lipoidal antigens released from damaged host cells as well as T pallidum. The non-treponemal tests quantify disease activity, as titers correlate with disease burden and decrease with effective treatment or during late latent (ie, more than 1 year duration) infection. Here, the patient's positive RPR and TPPA/FTA-ABS, along with the high RPR titer, consistent with either early syphilis or late syphilis with some ongoing inflammation/antigenic stimulus (eg, concurrent HIV). However, this patient has negative HIV serologies and no symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis. Therefore, although it is not possible to differentiate between late latent syphilis and syphilis of unknown duration without information on prior test results, treatment would be the same for these: benzathine penicillin G weekly for 3 doses.
D: Biopsy the affected tissue.

Explanation: Given the persistence and characteristic appearance of the patient's lesions (peeling gingiva that is bleeding, painful, and carries presence of Wickham striae), a tissue biopsy should be performed to establish the diagnosis. The most likely diagnosis is oral lichen planus (OLP), which is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the oral mucosa. OLP presents with various forms, including reticular (white Wickham striae), erosive (areas of erythema, ulceration, or both), and atrophic (thin, erythematous areas). Valacyclovir, which is an antiviral, is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence indicating an active herpetic infection. Vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency may lead to oral manifestations, but given her diet history and the characteristic presentation of the lesions, this diagnosis is less likely. Alcohol- based mouthwashes may cause dryness and worsen the patient's symptoms, whereas an alcohol-free mouthwash with a neutral pH can be beneficial for oral hygiene in this patient's case.

The answer is C: Hypoplasminogenemia.

Explanation: Hypoplasminogenemia, an autosomal recessive condition, makes the most sense given the patient's history and symptoms, as well as the histopathologic findings. The long-standing history of ligneous conjunctivitis and the recent development of gingival disease with pathologic changes characteristic of ligneous periodontitis are both seen in this condition. Hypoplasminogenemia, which causes plasminogen deficiency, results in the accumulation of fibrin on mucosal surfaces because of reduced fibrinolysis, as seen in the histological samples provided. Neither the symptoms nor the histopathological findings are characteristic for amyloidosis, systemic sclerosis, or lipoid proteinosis.

The correct answer is C: Neonatal Pemphigus Vulgaris.

Explanation: The clinical and histopathological findings, particularly the presence of acantholysis (separation of epidermal cells) and the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) within intercellular spaces of the epidermis (also known as a "chicken wire" pattern), are highly suggestive of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease caused by autoantibodies directed against desmosomal proteins that hold skin cells together, resulting in acantholysis and blister formation. In neonates, the condition can result from passive transfer of maternal autoantibodies across the placenta. The mother may or may not have signs of the disease, as in this case, where the mother denied having any blistering disorder or autoimmune disease. The diagnosis of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris can be confirmed with immunofluorescence studies, as was done here. This condition typically resolves within weeks to months after birth as maternal antibodies are cleared from the neonate's circulation.

C: Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders on face and torso, sun exposure, and pathological findings such as distended sebaceous lobules with associated follicular dilatation and a mild chronic perivascular and perifollicular lymphomononuclear infiltrate, suggest a diagnosis of Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis. NSA is a rare, idiopathic condition that characteristically affects the face and scalp. It is histopathologically characterized by neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding and infiltrating the sebaceous glands, with associated sebocyte necrosis. NSA has a favorable prognosis and commonly resolves without scarring in weeks to months. This would also explain the lack of scaling and the patient's experience of the lesions rapidly enlarging. Factors such as significant sun exposure could also have triggered the condition.

B: Erythema ab igne with superimposed chemotherapy effect

Explanation: Erythema ab igne is a skin condition characterized by reticulated erythema and hyperpigmentation caused by prolonged exposure to indirect heat or infrared radiation. In this case, the patient's habit of sitting in front of his fireplace is the likely cause. The superimposed effect of chemotherapy contributes to the condition as the chemotherapy drug used by the patient, etoposide, could potentially cause skin abnormalities. Psoriasis vulgaris and pityriasis rubra pilaris typically present as scaly plaques over various body sites, and not localized to an area of heat exposure. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus does not commonly cause an erythematous plaque with a micaceous scale distinguished in the mid-back.

B: Obtain optical coherence tomography

Explanation: The patient's complaints of a central “band” of vision loss and retina abnormalities observed in the superior macula via fundus autofluorescence and fluorescein angiogram suggest a retinal condition. The absence of edema, hemorrhage, or leakage rules out diseases that would typically be associated with these symptoms, such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. An Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scan would provide a detailed image of the retina, helping to reveal structural changes that may be causing the vision loss. Intravitreal injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent or blood tests for vasculitis workup may not provide additional information, and ocular ultrasonography would not offer the level of detail afforded by OCT.

D: Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest an acute compartment syndrome of the orbit, which can be initially managed with a lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis. This procedure would be done to relieve pressure on the optic nerve and surrounding structures in the right eye. While other options like surgical re-exploration, emergent angiography, and immediate anticoagulation can be considered, they may delay the pressure relief necessary for the restoration of blood flow to the optic nerve. Option D would provide the quickest relief of the symptoms.

D: Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis.

Explanation: This patient's signs and symptoms, such as acute postoperative vision loss, ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and an afferent pupillary defect with radiographic evidence of diffuse enlargement of the extraocular muscles are consistent with orbital compartment syndrome (OCS). OCS results in increased orbital pressure, limiting ocular blood flow and leading to ischemia and irreversible vision loss if not promptly managed. The definitive treatment for OCS is lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis to alleviate the orbital pressure. Other options such as surgical re-exploration (A), emergent angiography (B), or immediate anticoagulation (C) may be considered in other cases of acute visual loss postoperatively, but are not primary interventions for OCS.

The answer is B: Emergent angiography. 

Explanation: In this case, postoperative visual loss combined with ophthalmoplegia following a craniotomy is concerning for orbital compartment syndrome or orbital apex syndrome, potentially secondary to aneurysm clip misplacement or intra-orbital hemorrhage. In this scenario, emergent angiography is the next best step. 

Angiography will help to confirm or exclude vascular causes and precisely define the location of the problem. If abnormal vascular flow is found, particularly related to the positions of vascular clips or compromise of arteriovenous flow, immediate re-exploration could then be carried out. Alternatively, if a vascular cause is not found, other investigations or interventions can be made. 

Choices A and C would be premature without having a vascular cause confirmed. Although a canthotomy and cantholysis (choice D) can be a consideration to relieve intraorbital pressure, in this case, the findings are not consistent with orbital compartment syndrome, which typically includes severe proptosis and significant elevation in intraocular pressure. Consequently, B: Emergent angiography is the best answer.

D: Infantile myofibroma

Explanation: The physical examination indicated a mobile mass in the newborn's chest area that is firm, round, and not smooth or homogeneous to the touch. Neither discoloration nor any abnormality was detected in the overlying skin. These characteristics are in line with a diagnosis of Infantile myofibroma. Infantile myofibromas are benign tumors common in infancy and childhood. They may appear as a solitary lesion or multiple lesions (myofibromatosis). They are often firm, round masses found on the skin or beneath the skin. Other options such as Infantile hemangioma usually present with a characteristic skin discoloration which was absent in this case. Neuroblastoma typically presents with additional systemic symptoms and Dermoid cyst normally has a consistent, smooth feel, unlike the mass described here.

B: Sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis

Explanation: Sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis, also known as cocoon abdomen, is a rare syndrome characterized by a thick fibro-collagenous membrane that partially or completely encases the small bowel. It typically presents as intestinal obstruction, as is observed in our patient. Key findings include dilated small bowel loops compressed to one side of the abdomen, with the caecum and ascending colon often displaced laterally to the right, as seen in the provided image. Peritoneal mesothelioma could be a possibility due to the patient's history of asbestos exposure but usually presents with nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss and abdominal pain. On imaging, both peritoneal encapsulation and mesothelioma typically cause thickening and enhancement of peritoneum instead of dilated bowel loops. Malrotation with Ladd bands generally presents earlier in life, and the imaging typically shows abnormal positioning of the small and large bowel instead of simply dilated bowel loops.

C: Neurofibroma

Explanation: The multiple, fleshly cutaneous nodules shown on the patient's skin combined with the large, complex, septated mass in the abdomen suggest neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder often associated with neurofibromas. Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors typical in NF1. Recurrent GI bleeding and melena in this patient could be associated with gastrointestinal involvement in NF1, leading to formation of GI neurofibromas. Therefore, the diagnosis of Neurofibroma fits best in this situation.

A: The patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

Explanation: To accurately diagnose a UTI, the presence of symptoms corresponding to typical UTI symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain) is necessary, along with positive urine diagnostic tests. In this case, the patient does not present typical UTI symptoms but has a positive urine culture and urinalysis. This is indicative of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is common among elderly, especially those living in nursing homes or with urinary incontinence, and usually does not require treatment unless prior to urologic surgery or in pregnancy. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria can lead to antibiotic resistance. Chronic incontinence does not necessarily indicate a UTI, and a positive urinalysis and urine culture without corresponding symptoms are not always a UTI. Also, having a history of recurrent UTIs does not necessarily mean every positive urine test result indicates another UTI. As such, patient symptoms and clinical presentation need to be considered alongside test results.

C: Consult neurosurgery for biopsy 

Explanation: The patient's age, chronic kidney disease, trip to New York, and presentation with multiple cystic brain lesions with ring enhancement with a history of left facial droop and left-sided weakness put him at an increase risk for brain abscesses, which often manifest as multiloculated and ring-enhancing cystic lesions located in the gray-white matter junction and are usually caused by bacteria. These abscesses may be neurologically silent until they reach a significant size. However, our patient's presentation is not typical for brain abscesses, as he lacks fever or leukocytosis and his condition has not deteriorated over weeks which usually happen in most abscesses. In this scenario, a definitive diagnosis should be established prior to instituting empiric antimicrobial therapy, so neurosurgical consultation for biopsy would be the best next step. It will allow for gram stain, culture, and histopathological examination helping to guide targeted therapy. Empiric antimicrobial treatment including the regimen in the option of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and metronidazole should only be initiated in patients with brain abscess who show significant neurological impairment or in those who are critically ill.

C: Consult neurosurgery for biopsy

Explanation: This patient's chronic (weeks-long) course, lack of progression of symptoms, presence of multiloculated, ring-enhancing brain lesions with vasogenic edema, and absence of fevers make central nervous system (CNS) abscess less likely. Empiric antimicrobial therapy covering common bacterial pathogens (eg, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole) is not indicated. His MRI findings and clinical presentation are most suggestive of a neoplastic process such as a primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). The patient should be evaluated by neurosurgery and potentially undergo biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Lumbar puncture (option B) could also be considered but might not yield diagnosis because PCNSL cells may not always be present in the cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, lumbar puncture should be avoided in patients with lesions causing mass effect due to the risk of brain herniation. Systemic corticosteroids (option D) would reduce the vasogenic edema associated with the lesions, potentially improving symptoms, but steroid-induced changes can hinder interpretation of biopsy findings and should generally be avoided until tissue diagnosis is confirmed or if the patient has significant mass effect causing neurologic deterioration.
API request failed on attempt 2. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
C: Consult neurosurgery for biopsy

Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging are consistent with brain abscesses, which are most commonly found in the setting of a contiguous focus of infection (eg, sinusitis, otitis media, dentition), hematogenous spread from a distant site (eg, endocarditis), or, less commonly, direct implantation during a neurosurgical procedure. This patient has no history of a contiguous focus of infection or recent neurosurgery. His chronic kidney disease may predispose to hematogenous abscess from an unrecognized or transient bacteremia. Clinical manifestations may range from nonspecific symptoms (eg, headache) to focal neurologic deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure. The bacteria responsible for brain abscesses often reflect the primary site of infection. Aerobic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes are most common.
Despite the broad coverage provided by ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole, empiric antibiotic therapy alone is not sufficient. Instead, image-guided stereotactic needle aspiration should be performed to establish a microbiologic diagnosis and potentially provide therapeutic drainage. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated due to the risk of brain herniation. Systemic corticosteroids may reduce vasogenic edema but should not be routinely used due to potential impairment of the host immune response.

C: Prescribe oral anthelmintic therapy

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination suggest a parasitic skin infection commonly known as cutaneous larva migrans (CLM). This condition is characterized by serpiginous, intensely pruritic lesions commonly found on areas of the body that have been in contact with contaminated soil or sand, often in tropical or subtropical regions. The primary cause of CLM is hookworm larvae, which are not usually endemic to humans. As the larvae migrate under the skin, they cause intense itching and the appearance of red, snaking trails or lines. Treatment typically involves oral anthelmintic therapy to kill the larvae, hence option C: Prescribe oral anthelmintic therapy is the most appropriate choice. This condition rarely resolves on its own and topical steroids or oral antibiotics are not effective against the worm larvae.

C: The patient does not have LTBI. No further evaluation is needed.

Explanation: The patient's test values fall within the negative range according to the interferon-γ release assay report. The TB antigen minus nil value is less than 0.35 IU/mL and less than 25% of the nil value. Additionally, the nil value is less than 8 IU/mL and there is a positive mitogen response, all of which indicate a negative IGRA test result. Therefore, despite her positive TST, the patient does not have LTBI according to the IGRA. It's important to note that false positives on the TST can occur in patients who have been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine, as is the case with this patient. This is why IGRA tests, which are not affected by prior BCG vaccination, can be helpful in such situations. Since the patient also has no symptoms and a normal chest radiograph, no further evaluation for TB is needed at this time.

B: Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type

Explanation: The patient’s clinical presentation and histopathological findings are indicative of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. This rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma primarily affects the nasopharyngeal region, but can manifest in the skin with a rapidly growing, ulcerated lesion. It is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is confirmed in this case through the use of EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) in-situ hybridization test. The angiocentrism - the lymphoid cells infiltrating the vessels (vascular destruction) - demonstrated in the biopsy is a distinctive feature of this type of lymphoma. The elevated LDH level often suggests a high tumor burden, which is also common in NK/T-cell lymphomas. The absence of lymphadenopathy effectively rules out cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, which usually present with lymph node involvement. Blastomycosis, a fungal infection, would typically be associated with a history of exposure in endemic areas and additional systemic symptoms.

C: Generalized essential telangiectasia

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and history point to the diagnosis of Generalized essential telangiectasia (GET), a rare condition where widespread tiny, dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) appear on the skin. GET typically does not have mucosal or internal involvement, confirming the diagnosis for this patient. Also, her clinical presentation does not align with the descriptions of Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia which usually include mucocutaneous and visceral arteriovenous malformations, and systemic lupus erythematosus, symptomized by systemic inflammation and multiorgan damage. Moreover, Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is usually associated with a distinctive histologic pattern of superficial dermal blood vessels with thickened, hyalinized walls which is not seen in this patient.

C: Langerhans cell histiocytosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation of erosive plaques in the intertriginous regions might lead one to consider multiple diagnoses such as intertrigo and hailey-hailey disease. However, the essential clue in this case comes from the description of the punch biopsy that states there were "abundant atypical cells within the epidermis and papillary dermis." In particular, the cells had "reniform nuclei," which is characteristic of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Although it commonly presents in children, it can also present in adults with skin manifestations including scaly seborrheic dermatitis-like patches, ulcerative lesions, and occasionally intertriginous plaques. The definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy demonstrating Langerhans cells, as described in the case. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is "C: Langerhans cell histiocytosis."

B: OCT imaging 

Explanation: OCT imaging enables clinicians to visualize ocular tissues at microscopic resolution. This advanced imaging technique can provide critical information concerning changes in retinal layers associated with ocular trauma. In this case, subfoveal debris and distortion of the normal foveal architecture has been noted in the OCT imaging after the initial trauma, strongly suggesting disruption at the level of the photoreceptor layers. Thus OCT imaging should be repeated to monitor for any possible resolution or progression of the retinal changes following the trauma. As the patient is presenting with ongoing visual symptoms and complains of vision loss, further evaluation beyond reinforcement of observation is necessary to better assess the specific cause of the patients symptoms and better guide treatment options. The other options are less preferred because it is necessary to do a more thorough assessment before concluding reassurance and observation. Looking for secondary gain and performing an electroretinogram may not provide the necessary information for this patient's issues. Thus, using OCT imaging seems the most direct and helpful approach in this scenario.

B: Neuroimaging of brain and orbits. 

Explanation: 
In this case, a broad differential diagnosis can be considered, which includes infectious causes (like syphilitic neuroretinitis, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease, and bacterial endocarditis), inflammatory causes (like sarcoidosis), and other retinal vascular disorders (like Eales disease and retinal vein occlusion). Neuroimaging of the brain and orbits is necessary before other less likely diagnoses are considered. Pars plana vitrectomy, anterior chamber paracentesis, and blood cultures are invasive and should be reserved for cases where the diagnosis remains unclear after neuroimaging. A neuroretinal disorder due to an underlying systemic disease seems more likely, which can be best investigated by the application of neuroimaging of the brain and orbits.

A: Microcystic lymphatic malformation

Explanation: The combination of the patient's age, clinical history, and histologic findings is consistent with a Microcystic lymphatic malformation. These are congenital malformations of the lymphatic system that present as soft, deep blue-to-purple vesicle clusters, often likened to a bag of grapes. They are caused by the abnormal formation of lymphatic vessels. They can be single or multiple, and they are usually present at birth. Over time, these lesions may increase in size due to the collection of lymph fluid, but they do not normally regress. The histologic findings of thin-walled vascular-like spaces filled with lymph in the dermis also support this diagnosis. Other options like Congenital melanocytic nevus, Venous malformation or Nevus sebaceous would have different clinical and histological presentations.

C: Peritoneal carcinomatosis

Explanation: The referred case presents a cluster of symptoms, including abdominal pain, jaundice, a duodenal mass, and several physiological abnormalities such as elevated bilirubin and enzyme levels, which are common in cases of metastatic cancer. Also notable is the presence of nodules along the peritoneal reflection of the right paracolic gutter which signifies the spread of cancer cells along the surface of the peritoneum, known as peritoneal carcinomatosis. Thus, considering the age of the patient, the location and size of the lesion, and overall biochemical analysis, the most likely diagnosis is "Peritoneal carcinomatosis", caused by the spread of cancer from the primary pancreatic neoplasm.

Further confirmatory tests like biopsies and cultures could provide more specific information, but based on the provided information, option C seems to be the most appropriate choice.

A: Desmoid fibromatosis

Explanation: Desmoid fibromatosis presents as a well-circumscribed mass, usually with robust soft-tissue infiltrative margins. The woman's biopsy showed a myofibroblastic proliferation, a key characteristic seen in Desmoid fibromatosis. This, along with the MRI findings support the diagnosis. It is also known that these tumors decrease in size after pregnancy, as seen in the patient's case. Desmoid fibromatosis, although benign, can infiltrate local tissues and can be locally aggressive, supporting the actions to monitor the progression of the lesion and proceed with resection after delivery. The negative S100 and desmin staining further supports the exclusion of leiomyosarcoma and some forms of neurofibromas.

C: Perform leishmaniasis polymerase chain reaction testing of biopsied tissue

Explanation: The patient's history of travel to the Venezuelan rainforest, resistance to multiple antibiotics, and the nature and location of his lesions are suggestive of a potential cutaneous leishmaniasis infection. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the Leishmania species, transmitted through the bite of infected sand flies. It is prevalent in certain tropical and subtropical regions and presents as skin lesions that can vary significantly in appearance. The lesion can manifest as erythematous papules or nodules, plaques, or ulcers. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia observed on biopsy can often mask underlying organisms, hence specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Leishmania is recommended. This test is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis, thus making option C the most suitable next step in this case.

B: Order flow cytometry of the peripheral blood sample.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptom of fatigue and the findings of an elevated white blood cell count with lymphocytic predominance, smudge cells visible on peripheral blood smear, and mature and heterogeneous lymphocytes, the suspicion is high for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that predominantly affects older adults and often presents with gradual onset fatigue. The diagnosis of CLL requires demonstration of clonal B cell lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry, which typically shows a characteristic phenotype of weak expression of surface immunoglobulin, CD20, and CD79b; strong expression of CD19 and CD5; and expression of CD23. While the other proposed diagnostic studies (mononucleosis test, lymph node biopsy, and computed tomography of the chest and abdomen) may be valuable under different circumstances, they are not the most appropriate next diagnostic step in a case with high suspicion for CLL. In the case of CLL, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood is the test of choice because it can confirm the diagnosis in most cases.

A: Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma

Explanation: Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (HPA) is a condition characterized by the presence of asymptomatic, translucent papules on the palms and soles. These papules may become more noticeable following immersion in water. There is often a lack of symptoms despite the prominence of skin findings. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and often begins in the late childhood or early adulthood. In this case, the patient showed signs of HPA such as the presence of numerous asymptomatic flesh-colored to translucent papules on her palms and similar lesions on her feet. Moreover, the patient reported that her mother had similar findings on her hands and feet, suggesting a possible familial pattern. The central depression in some papules also supports the diagnosis. This condition can be distinguished from other similar appearing conditions by its unique clinical and histopathologic characteristics. The absence of blistering helps to differentiate it from conditions such as dyshidrotic pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa simplex. The absence of eczema-like features, itching, and response to treatments for eczema also helps to differentiate it from dyshidrotic eczema.

A: Sweet syndrome

Explanation: Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a skin condition characterized by fever, elevated neutrophil count, and tender erythematous skin lesions. The symptoms described - painful perivulvar eruption, fever and rigors 7 days after chemotherapy - correspond with a typical presentation of Sweet syndrome. This condition is often associated with malignancies, infections, medications, or pregnancy.

Furthermore, the histopathologic analysis showing spongiosis and hyperplasia of the epidermis with neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis supports the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome, as neutrophil infiltration is a key feature.

Laboratory findings, such as an increased number of neutrophils, and a good response to systemic corticosteroids also support this diagnosis. Sweet syndrome frequently occurs during chemotherapy cycles in patients with leukemia, like the patient here. The mucosal sparing, erythematous nodules, and histologic changes of neutrophilic dermal infiltrate suggest Sweet syndrome rather than the other options.

C: Porokeratosis ptychotropica

Explanation: Porokeratosis ptychotropica is a rare variant of porokeratosis, a disorder of keratinization, that predominantly affects the buttocks and perianal area. It is characterized by multiple coalescent hyperkeratotic papules and plaques with well-demarcated raised margins, which can resemble psoriasis or lichen planus but the lesions do not respond completely to treatments like corticosteroids, antifungal agents, or immunomodulators. The definitive diagnosis is made by skin biopsy, which shows cornoid lamella, a distinctive feature of porokeratosis. The patient's clinical presentation, dermoscopy finding, and resistance to treatment could suggest Porokeratosis ptychotropica.

B: Bullous prurigo pigmentosa. 

Explanation: The widespread distribution of the lesions, the unique reticular appearance of the eruption, trauma-induced bullae, and a dense infiltration of eosinophils at the dermal-epidermal junction, as well as the epidermal necrosis seen on biopsy, are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of bullous prurigo pigmentosa. Prurigo pigmentosa is a rare inflammatory skin disease with a predilection for young adults and individuals of Japanese ancestry. While the pathogenesis is not completely understood, keto diet, fasting, diabetes mellitus and a Helicobacter pylori infection have been reported as potential precipitating factors.

B: Initiate treatment with rituximab

Explanation: 
The patient's B-cell lymphoma diagnosis points toward a therapy that will target the atypical, CD20-positive B cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein found on the surface of B cells. Therefore, initiating treatment with rituximab (option B) has been shown to be an effective treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Secondly, the presence of lymphadenopathy suggests that surgical excision (option C) might not be curative as the disease may have already spread. 
Option D does not give a sufficiently aggressive treatment approach for this kind of lymphoma.
Option A, although it may seem viable, is not as desirable as option B since radiation and/or chemotherapy are often reserved for more advanced or aggressive forms of lymphoma, or in situations where targeted therapies like rituximab are not effective or not appropriate. Furthermore, these options can have additional side effects that may affect the quality of life.
Therefore, the next appropriate step should be the initiation of treatment with rituximab given a diagnosis of DLBCL. As always, the chosen treatment would be dependent on further discussion with the patient about the potential benefits, side effects, and implications for his overall healthcare.

Answer: B

Explanation: Oral steroids may be used to reduce inflammation causing the exudative retinal detachment. They have been known to help reduce subretinal fluid and aid in the resorption of choroidal effusion in certain scenarios. One must however remember that steroids could lead to an increase in IOP, especially in a patient with a known history of glaucoma, and hence must be started carefully under close monitoring of IOP. Drainage of the choroidal effusion (option A) might be too invasive and may result in complications. Similarly, anti-VEGF therapy (option D) might subject the young patient to systemic side effects. Oral propranolol (option C) would not be the best choice here as its role is primarily seen in treating heart conditions and certain types of tumors such as hemangiomas. In this situation with SWS and complex retinal detachment, the use of systemic steroids seems more reasonable compared to the other options listed.
B: Incontinentia pigmenti

Explanation: The linear distribution of the skin lesions suggests a disorder that follows the lines of Blaschko, which are pathways of epidermal cell migration and proliferation during fetal development. The presence of vesicles is also consistent with the first stage of incontinentia pigmenti (also known as Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome), a rare X-linked dominant disorder that affects the skin, teeth, nails, skeletal system, eyes, and central nervous system. The disorder primarily affects females, but it can also occur in males due to postzygotic mosaicism or an atypical form of X-inactivation. The first stage (vesicular stage) typically begins at birth with the appearance of erythema, vesicles, and pustules along the lines of Blaschko. These lesions gradually progress, over weeks or months, through four stages: vesicular, verrucous, hyperpigmented, and atrophic. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by skin biopsy demonstrating eosinophilic spongiosis (intracellular edema) and by genetic testing showing mutations in the IKBKG gene. If incontinentia pigmenti is suspected, a multi-disciplinary approach should be taken to manage various systemic complications.

C: Small-bowel volvulus

Explanation: The patient's symptoms paired with her history and imaging results can suggest a diagnosis of small-bowel volvulus. This condition often presents with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and a palpable mass, which lines up with the woman's symptoms. This is further supported by the abdominal CT identifying a mass on the right side of the paraumbilical point, a common characteristic of small-bowel volvulus. Notably, mesenteric ischemia (D) could also represent with similar symptoms, but the presentation of a defined mass in CT scan, the patient's age and gender leans more towards a diagnosis of small bowel volvulus. Furthermore, while intussusception (A) and colon cancer (B) can cause similar symptoms, they are less likely given the specific imaging findings and patient medical history.

B: Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement. 

Explanation: Option B seems to be the most appropriate given the patient's medical history and the physical findings. Through a laparoscopic procedure, a less invasive approach can be taken to correct the hernia. This would provide an opportunity to reduce the hernia and place a mesh to support the defect without the need for a larger incision or thoracic surgery. It also allows accessibility to the area that has been found to have the hernia, without extending into the thoracic region. The use of a mesh can help to reduce the hernia, provide support for the weakened tissue, and reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This type of procedure also takes into account her obesity, allowing a less invasive approach and potentially faster healing process.

Due to the nature of limited data, it is not possible to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, let’s choose the most probable differential based on the information. 

Answer: D

Explanation: Pheochromocytoma is a probable diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. While the patient's symptoms could be associated with any of these conditions, the location and size of the mass, as well as the patient's history, lean toward a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors that originate in the adrenal glands, but may also occur elsewhere in the body. They can cause hypertension(which is present in the patient's history), abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation. Furthermore, the large size of the mass implies that it is a solid tumor rather than a cystic structure or an abscess, which are usually smaller and present with more acute symptoms. However, a definitive diagnosis would need further laboratory and possibly biopsy.
A

Explanation: The presence of numerous red papules on the tongue and skin, a history of recurrent epistaxis, and neurologic symptoms in this patient are most consistent with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by mucocutaneous and visceral telangiectasias that result in recurrent bleeding. Mucocutaneous lesions are usually not present in infancy but increase in number over time. The patient's brain lesion with surrounding edema could be an intracranial hemorrhage from a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, a common complication in HHT. Therefore, the patient should be referred to a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT findings. A CT of the lung and abdomen is also necessary because HHT can result in arteriovenous malformations in these locations. Genetic counseling should be offered because this is a hereditary condition.
D: The patient does not have hepatic encephalopathy so no treatment is necessary.

Explanation: Even though the patient has a history of liver disease, the patient's cognition and mental status remained stable throughout the hospital stay, and they exhibit no symptoms characteristic of hepatic encephalopathy such as confusion, altered sleep patterns, or decreased mental alertness. Hepatic encephalopathy is often a complication of severe liver disease like cirrhosis, but in this case, symptoms associated with this condition are not present. Consequently, there's no direct indication to treat hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's serum ammonia level have been checked as part of routine liver transplantation evaluation, but ammonia levels alone are not always a reliable marker for diagnosing hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, given the present stable condition, the patient does not require treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. However, ongoing management of his other conditions such as ascites and cirrhosis remain necessary.

B

Explanation: The signs and symptoms along with the patient's history suggest a lupus-like syndrome, which is an autoimmune condition that can occur after stem cell transplantation. Given the multiorgan involvement – malar rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, myositis, and hematologic changes, a holistic diagnosis should be accommodated. The malar rash that spares the nasolabial folds is distinctive for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Confirming this requires a biopsy, thus, the answer should be to Obtain a skin punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis (Option B). Ordering further antibody tests (Option A) could also be informative, but histological confirmation is the best next step. Starting treatment before confirmation (Option C & D) would not be the most judicious approach. 
D: Perform orbitotomy with biopsy.

Explanation: The option of proceeding with an orbitotomy for biopsy is the best next step given the patient's symptoms and the presentation of an infiltrating mass demonstrated by the MRI scans. The mass could be contributing to the forehead numbness, eyelid edema, and changes in ocular motility. Pathological analysis of the mass is important for a definitive diagnosis, which can subsequently guide appropriate treatment. Observing may not provide enough information, administering corticosteroids empirically may not address the underlying cause (if the mass is not responsive to steroids), and performing radiotherapy without knowing the nature of the lesion is not advisable. Therefore, a biopsy is the necessary next step.

B: Treat with oral corticosteroids

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination indicate a posterior uveitis, likely due to an inflammatory or infectious etiology. The "shimmering lights" and blurry vision can be associated with inflammation in the posterior segment of the eye. The small yellow-white lesions deep in the retina and the hyperfluorescent lesions in the fluorescein angiograms demonstrate inflammation at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. While often empiric treatment with oral corticosteroids is initiated, an attempt to identify the underlying systemic condition, often an autoimmune disease, should also be made. This could potentially lead to more specific immunosuppressive therapy. Topical corticosteroids would not reach the posterior segment of the eye in sufficient quantities, and there is no indication for intravitreal antibiotics. Monitoring would not be advisable given the progressive nature of posterior uveitis.

C: Coccidioidomycosis

Explanation: The clinical presentation and histological finding of multiple spherules containing endospores in the excised lymph node are characteristic of Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever. This is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides species, which are endemic to the southwestern United States, including southern California where this patient resides. The patient's symptoms, such as absence of fever, lack of travel history, and negative results for HIV and Tuberculin tests, also align with this diagnosis. Tuberculosis and Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection typically present with systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss and the histological findings would not typically include characteristic coccidioidomycosis spherules. Lymphoma, on the other hand, would typically present with more distinct systemic and histological features. 

Therefore, considering all the diagnostic clues and evidence, the answer is "C: Coccidioidomycosis".

C: Splenic lymphangiomatosis. 

Explanation: The case describes a young otherwise healthy woman with massive splenomegaly, migratory urticaric maculopapular rash, and symptoms including fatigue, early satiety, and back pain. Although the options provided are all conditions associated with splenomegaly, splenic lymphangiomatosis is a rare, benign, and non-metastatic disease of lymphatic origin that can present as massive splenomegaly, which is consistent with the discussed scenario. Peliosis of spleen generally does not result in massive splenomegaly, echinococcal disease usually have a history of contact with dogs or livestock which is not mentioned in the case, and in Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, hematologic workup is usually abnormal but it's unremarkable in this case, making these options less likely.

A: Catheterization of left pericardiacophrenic vein

Explanation: The placement of the catheter as seen on the radiograph suggests that it is located in the pericardiacophrenic vein which runs alongside the phrenic nerve and the internal thoracic artery. This rare occurrence can happen where the needle trajectory is more anterior during attempted internal jugular vein cannulation under ultrasound guidance. The actual position of a central venous catheter can be difficult to assess on a chest radiograph, particularly when it is not in the anticipated position. It can trail over the top of the left lung before descending into the pericardiacophrenic vein on the lateral border of the heart. The tip position is important to prevent complications and to ensure correct functioning. Avoiding this misplacement can be achieved by careful attention to needle direction during cannulation. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility and consider it in their differential when a catheter tip is not in an expected location.

D: Prescribe oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy.

Explanation: Erythema multiforme is usually an acute disease but can be recurrent and persist for years. Infections, particularly herpes simplex, are often triggers. The patient’s positive HSV serologies despite the absence of recognized oral or genital herpes make HSV a likely trigger. When no trigger is identified, therapy is aimed at symptomatic relief with topical or systemic corticosteroids. This patient had symptom relief with prednisone but experienced recurrence after discontinuation. In such situations, when a potential infectious trigger (eg, HSV) is present, suppression of the infectious agent may prevent recurrent disease. This patient should therefore be prescribed long-term HSV suppression with an antiviral agent (eg, acyclovir, valacyclovir) in addition to a course of prednisone during disease flares. After several months free of disease, the need for continued HSV suppression and other potential triggers should be reassessed.

D: Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination.

Explanation: Given the long duration of the lesion, its atypical appearance, and ineffective initial therapy, a malignancy such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should be considered. SCC often appears as a nonhealing ulcer or plaque that grows slowly in the anogenital region, and a biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Although syphilis could cause plaques in the anogenital region, other findings (eg, lymphadenopathy) commonly associated with syphilis are absent. Off-label use of valacyclovir might be considered for treatment of viral conditions (eg, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus), but these typically would not persist and enlarge over 2 years. Topical steroids are generally not recommended without knowing the definite cause as they might promote further growth or delay recognition of malignant conditions.

1447
C: Primary aldosteronism is suggested; confirmation requires an aldosterone suppression test.

Explanation: The Aldosterone-Renin ratio (ARR) test is a tool for primary aldosteronism screening. A high ARR suggests increased aldosterone production independent of renin, which is seen in primary aldosteronism. When an elevated ARR leads to suspicion of primary aldosteronism, a confirmatory aldosterone suppression test is generally needed to confirm the diagnosis. This patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled despite the use of medications, he has a history of hypokalemic hypertension, and his test results suggest a high ARR, all of which point to the need for a further test, specifically the aldosterone suppression test.  While imaging can sometimes be useful, it isn't considered confirmatory. The results shouldn't be deemed unreliable given the patient's clinical scenario, waiting another month to repeat the test wouldn't change this recommendation. Thus, the answer is C.

A: Screen for autoantibodies

Explanation: The patient's condition was steadily deteriorating in spite of negative test results for common diseases, which suggests the possibility of some sort of autoimmune disorder affecting the nervous system. Although her antinuclear antibody, extractable nuclear antigen, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test results were negative, these tests can sometimes give a false negative result in patients with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a more detailed screening for autoantibodies that can cause neurological symptoms, such as antibodies against neuronal cell surface proteins, intracellular antigens, and specific types of white blood cells, may provide valuable diagnostic information. Additionally, the patient's symptoms, including her transient blurred vision, could be manifestations of conditions such as Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), Autoimmune encephalitis, and other atypical or rare autoimmune disorders, which again points to the need for a more specific autoantibodies screen to identify the underlying condition. Therefore, based on her clinical manifestation and investigation findings, the most appropriate next step would be to further pursue an autoimmune etiology.

D

Explanation: The presentation of this patient's symptoms along with the physical exam findings (e.g., disc edema, deep yellow-white retinal lesions) suggest a possible infectious cause, specifically, bartonellosis, caused by Bartonella henselae. This condition, also known as cat-scratch disease, can cause neuroretinitis, a condition characterized by optic disc swelling, macular star formation and a decrease in visual acuity. Ordering serum titers for IgM and IgG against Bartonella henselae would help confirm or rule out bartonellosis. Simply observing the patient (A) could risk progression in her condition without understanding the cause. Starting steroid therapy (B) without accurate diagnosis could potentially worsen an infectious condition. While an MRI (C) may be helpful in some cases, it may not be necessary to identify the cause of this patient's specific ocular symptoms.
C: Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome

Explanation: The patient's presentation and history suggest non-specific inflammation rather than infection, considering the recurrent nature of the symptoms and the lack of response to antibiotic treatment. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) is a non-neoplastic, non-infectious inflammatory disorder of the orbit. Typically, IOIS is characterized by rapid onset of eyelid swelling, redness, proptosis, and pain similar to the patient's manifestations. Chemosis and restriction of ocular motility can also occur. In this case, the rapid development of symptoms with intervals of no symptoms is too fast for neoplasia, such as rhabdomyosarcoma (option B), and there is no evidence of thyroid dysfunction that characterizes thyroid ophthalmopathy (Option D). Although orbital cellulitis (option A) could explain the clinical manifestations, the recurrent nature of the symptoms without clear evidence of an underlying infectious process makes this less likely. In addition, MRI and CT results indicating extraocular muscle and soft tissue enlargement, along with the inflammation of the intraconal fat and perineural soft tissues, support the diagnosis of IOIS. As per the presentation and the evaluation, the right diagnosis seems to be Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome.

B: Ileal intussusception. 

Explanation: The combination of the patient's reported symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiological imaging make Ileal intussusception the most likely diagnosis. An intussusception is a medical condition in which a part of the intestine folds into the section next to it, creating a "telescoping" effect. In this case, the ileum is the part of the intestinal tract that has intussuscepted, as suggested by abdominal computed tomography. An appendiceal abscess would normally result in a severe right lower quadrant pain and fever. Cecal volvulus is typically identified with a different radiological presentation, typically “coffee bean” sign on abdominal x-ray and it usually presents with obstipation. Appendiceal intussusception would also invovle the appendix, whereas the diagnostic images points the issue to involves the ileum.

C: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor

Explanation: This patient's presentation and radiographic findings are consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). A MPNST is a soft tissue sarcoma that arises in association with peripheral nerves or nerve sheath cells. They can occur sporadically or in association with neurofibromatosis 1(NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of complex skin tumors, spots, and freckles. The fact that the patient's son has NF1 suggests the possibility of a familial predisposition. The heterogeneously enhancing mass within the prostatic bed, the spindle cells from the biopsy with a low mitotic index, combined with the immunohistochemical staining results, are all consistent with a diagnosis of MPNST. The negative CDK4 staining helps to exclude other possible diagnoses, such as a recurrent prostatic carcinoma.

D: Bacterial abscess. 

Explanation: The man's clinical presentation – a rapidly growing, tender right flank mass with a purulent discharge – strongly suggests a bacterial abscess, more than a malignant sarcoma, fungal mycetoma, or giant infiltrating lipoma. The CT images support this: the mass invades the liver and extends through intercostal spaces, consistent with inflammation and infection. This invasion would be atypical in the other conditions. The patient's diabetes mellitus increases his risk for bacterial infections, including abscesses. Lastly, the inconclusive core needle biopsy result, while not definitive, is certain not uncommon in abscesses due to dead tissue or lack of viable bacteria in the sampled fluid. The immediate management, following the diagnosis of a bacterial abscess, would typically involve antimicrobial therapy and drainage.

1454
C: This patient has no liver damage because her aminotransferase levels are not elevated.

Explanation: The liver enzyme tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are within normal range. This typically indicates that there is no significant liver damage or inflammation occurring. The normal levels of total bilirubin and albumin also suggest that the liver is functioning well in terms of its ability to metabolize substances and synthesize proteins. However, it is important to note that normal liver function tests do not necessarily mean that the patient does not have Hepatitis C. These are simply measures of current liver status and do not indicate presence or absence of an infection. For an accurate diagnosis of Hepatitis C, HCV RNA PCR test, which measures the amount of Hepatitis C virus in the blood, is needed. If the patient has a positive anti-HCV result but negative HCV RNA PCR result, it means she might have cleared the infection on her own.

B: Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, combined with the findings of reduced left chest expansion and left lower lobe opacification on radiography, suggest a lung pathology. The lung opacification could be caused by various conditions like pneumonia, lung abscess, or even malignancies. A computed tomography scan of the chest would provide a more detailed understanding of the lung structure, possible masses, abscesses, or any other signs of disease that may not be visible on a chest X-ray. This would be the next best step in diagnosis before taking any therapeutic actions or proceeding with invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy or infectious workup.
API request failed on attempt 1. Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
B: Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest

Explanation: The patient's exams and clinical history indicate an issue within the thorax, likely near the left lower pulmonary lobe. A chest radiograph has shown opacification, suggesting something abnormal such as an infection, a mass or fluid build-up. In order to better visualise the extent of the opacification and to make a more definitive diagnosis, a higher-resolution imaging technique such as a Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest would be the next appropriate step. Options A and C, while valuable in some cases of suspected infection, are not the first line of action given the lack of typical infectious signs such as fever or a cough, and the duration of symptoms. Antibiotics (option D) should not be begun until the cause of the symptoms is better understood.

Given that she has left lower lobe opacification on her chest X-Ray, the most appropriate next step would be to get a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest to further evaluate the area of opacification. This will offer further insight into the aetiology of her symptoms, helping to differentiate among various possibilities like infection, malignancy, or a structural abnormality. A CT scan can provide more detailed images and information than a standard chest X-ray.

C: Perform a punch biopsy of the lesion

Explanation: This patient with longstanding, poorly controlled diabetes presents with a tender, enlarging shin lesion with characteristic findings of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD). This is a rare dermatologic complication of diabetes caused by collagen degeneration and inflammation of the vertical septa in subcutaneous fat. NLD usually occurs in the pretibial region of the legs. The lesions of NLD initially present as erythematous-to-brown papules that expand into plaques with an atrophic "waxy" or "shiny" center and a raised erythematous border, which is indicative of the active phase of the disease. They can be asymptomatic, or patients may report tenderness, itchiness, or pain.

The lesions of NLD can often be diagnosed clinically, but a skin biopsy demonstrating palisading granulomas in the dermis confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy also helps to rule out other conditions that could be in the differential diagnosis including granuloma annulare, morphea, and squamous cell carcinoma. The atrophic center of the NLD lesions can ulcerate, which is a challenging complication that often necessitates aggressive wound care and targeted therapy to prevent ulceration or foster reepithelialization.

B: Obtain a bone marrow biopsy. 

Explanation: The patient's progressive anemia and left upper quadrant pain, in combination with a history of polycythemia vera suggest possible myelofibrosis. Since polycythemia vera has a known risk to progress to myelofibrosis, a bone marrow biopsy would be necessary to rule this out as the cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's significant drop in hemoglobin levels over the past two months and an enlarged spleen are a concern. Performing a bone marrow biopsy can help identify if the bone marrow is failing (myelofibrosis), or if something else is causing the anemia. This would help guide the management plan. Other options like a conservative approach, upper endoscopy, or surgery should be considered after obtaining further diagnostic information from the biopsy.

D: Prescribe lubrication with autologous serum tears.

Explanation: This patient's corneal thinning, decreased sensation, and persistent epithelial defects suggest neurotrophic keratopathy. These lesions occur due to damage or dysfunction of the corneal nerves, leading to decreased corneal sensation, impairing wound healing and limbal stem cell survival. Diabetes is a common cause, and patients may present with recalcitrant erosions or ulcers in areas of diminished sensation. Systemic diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis) can have ocular manifestations that lead to decreased corneal sensation and subsequent neurotrophic keratopathy. Best practice for management includes a vigorous lubrication regimen and eliminating any inciting trauma. Autologous serum tears, which contain various epitheliotropic factors aiding the natural healing process, can be beneficial. In severe cases, surgical intervention, such as tarsorrhaphy, may be necessary. Prescribing oral prednisone may exacerbate the patient's uncontrolled diabetes. Wearing bandage contact lenses is not recommended due to his history of multiple corneal abrasions from lenses and his positive bacterial culture, which increase the infection risk.

B: Anterior segment tomography with Pentacam 

Explanation: The choice of the next step heavily relies on refining the diagnosis and obtaining more detailed insights about the lesion. While albendazole would be used in a treatment of systemic parasitic infection (option C), the patient hasn't shown any systemic symptoms to indicate that. On the other hand, using the computerized tomographic scan (option A) would perhaps be too excessive in this case. And carrying out a surgery (option D) without the certainty of the nature of the lesion, might not be the correct choice. Therefore, Anterior segment tomography with Pentacam (option B) would give detailed images of the lesion, thus it's the preferred next step in the management of the patient. It measures the anterior segment of the eye including cornea and the anterior chamber, providing necessary details about the shape, size, and location of the cyst, which are crucial for choosing the right treatment strategy.

D: Granuloma annulare. 

Explanation: The patient's presentation of asymptomatic, pink-violaceous, annular and nummular patches supports a diagnosis of granuloma annulare (GA), a benign, idiopathic, self-limited granulomatous skin disease. GA often presents in children and adolescents, frequently involving the lower extremities and trunk. The lesions of GA do not usually cause symptoms and heal spontaneously over time. Given that this patient has Crohn's disease and is on long-term immunomodulating medications, she could be more susceptible to developing GA. 
Fixed drug eruption would present with solitary or few well-demarcated round or oval patches or plaques that reappear at the same site each time the drug is taken; Tinea corporis usually present with itching, scaling, and central clearing, which isn’t the case in this patient; Lyme disease’s erythema migrans can mimic GA, but it usually occurs after a known tick bite and can present with other constitutive symptoms like fever, fatigue etc., however, lack of history of tick bite and upper respiratory tract symptoms makes it less likely.

B: Desmoid tumor

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, the location, size, and imaging features of the mass, and the photo of the surgical specimen are all suggestive of a desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors are rare, benign fibrous growths that arise from musculoaponeurotic stromal elements and have a propensity for local recurrence but do not metastasize. They can cause pain and intestinal obstruction if they grow large or if they are located near vital organs or structures, which aligns with our patient's symptoms. The tumors often appear as well-circumscribed, sometimes hypervascular, masses on imaging, similar to what our patient's scans showed. Furthermore, desmoid tumors typically have a characteristic 'whorled' appearance on gross pathology, as seen in this case.

C: Avulsed uterine fibroid.

Explanation: The presence of a large hematoma in the abdomen, coupled with the heterogenous and bulky uterus visible in the computed tomography scan, point toward the diagnosis of an avulsed uterine fibroid. This condition, although rare, can occur due to the trauma of a motor vehicle accident. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that can be agitated by severe impact, leading to hemorrhage and hematoma, and subsequently a hemoperitoneum, which would account for the large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Moreover, the fully revealed fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and distended abdomen are symptomatic of internal bleeding and pain, respectively, commonly seen in such cases.

B: Ileocolic intussusception. 

Explanation: Given the patient's history and the imaging shown, ileocolic intussusception is the most likely diagnosis. This is when part of the intestine folds into the section next to it, often compared to a telescope. It might explain her recurrent abdominal pain, bloody bowel movement as well as her small-bowel obstruction. The other options are less likely given the lack of symptoms typical for these conditions, patient's history, and the imaging from previous presentations. Furthermore, juvenile polyposis syndrome significantly increases the risk for intussusception.

A: Obtain imaging of the left leg. 

Explanation: Given the boy's presentation and symptoms, it is crucial to determine if there are any fractures or more severe injuries that might be causing the swelling, pain, and lactic acidosis. The observed hematoma, his left leg flexed condition and the bullae on the left foot may indicate trauma and injury related complications. This might help clarify the origin of the severe lactic acidosis along with the high serum level of creatinine kinase suggest muscle breakdown and damage. Imaging could help rule out or identify these potential issues. Moreover, it is important to rule out compartment syndrome which is a serious condition that involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment and can lead to muscle and nerve damage as well as problems with blood flow. The process will also provide a comprehensive overview of any potential damage to the limbs.

A: The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic. 

Explanation: The patient's rapid irregular heartbeat, diminished blood pressure, and diminished breath sounds in the bibasilar lung fields point to a condition of heart failure. This is confirmed by the atrial fibrillation shown on the 12-lead electrocardiogram and evidence of pulmonary edema in the chest x-ray. A loop diuretic will help to alleviate fluid congestion.

B: Prescribe topical interferon drops followed by excisional biopsy

Explanation: Given the patient's clinical features showing a progressive, enlarging mass over several months with associated pain and overlying pigmentation and vascular changes, there is high suspicion of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). OSSN is a spectrum of disease from dysplasia to invasive squamous cell carcinoma that affects the conjunctiva and cornea and is most often seen in older males. Risk factors include ultraviolet light exposure, human papillomavirus, and HIV.

Interferon alfa-2b has both antiviral and antineoplastic properties that make it an effective treatment for OSSN. Treatment typically involves several months of topical drops and subconjunctival injections. The majority of patients will have complete tumor resolution; however, in patients with persistent or recurrent disease after medical management, or those with advanced tumors that are unlikely to respond to drops alone, excisional biopsy with wide margins or even enucleation may be considered.

Despite the clinical features suggesting OSSN, obtaining histologic confirmation (either by incisional or excisional biopsy) before undertaking more radical treatment such as enucleation is prudent. Once histologic confirmation is obtained, further management depends on the tumor stage. Less invasive tumors can be managed with local resection or topical chemotherapy, while more advanced disease may necessitate orbital exenteration. However, given this patient's recent rapid progression and inability to close the eye, it's likely that he has a more advanced tumor that will require surgical excision after an attempt at medical management.

A: Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia)

Explanation: Leukocoria (white pupillary reflection) in a child is a notable sign which may indicate various serious conditions including retinoblastoma, cataracts, or Coats disease among others. A detailed examination is essential to identify the cause. Therefore, a funduscopic examination is critical, usually performed under anesthesia in small children for accurate evaluation. This would provide clear, direct visualization of the retina and help in determining the underlying condition. The other options like reassuring parents, obtaining serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis or starting anti-inflammatory are not immediately appropriate without a clear diagnosis.

B: Add an immunomodulatory agent. Explanation: This patient's condition appears to be deteriorating rapidly despite systemic corticosteroid treatment, indicating steroid-resistant sarcoidosis. Adding an immunomodulatory agent (IMA), such as methotrexate or infliximab, can be an effective approach to control steroid-resistant sarcoidosis. IMAs have been used successfully in many cases where corticosteroids have failed to control disease progression. While option A, increasing the dose of prednisone, seems intuitive, it may not overcome the potential steroid resistance and could increase the risk of side effects. Option C, further laboratory and imaging studies, could delay the needed therapy, given the severity and rapid progression of the patient's visual impairment. Option D, an urgent immunology consultation, although beneficial for long-term disease management, may not immediately address the patient's acute vision loss.

A: Ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowing for characterization of the lesion and its extent

Explanation: Given the lesion's size, irregularities in texture, and continued growth over time, the first step is to further characterize it and understand its extent. This is important to guide any potential future therapy and to determine if there is any involvement of underlying tissue that may not be visible on physical examination. While a biopsy may indeed confirm the presence of squamous cell carcinoma, it may not entirely characterize the extent of the lesion. Excision, while potentially curative, would not be the immediate step without understanding the lesion's full extent. Liquid nitrogen is generally used for smaller lesions and those on the surface of the skin, not for larger, possibly deeper ones. Lastly, given the size and growth of this lesion, while it isn't causing the patient symptoms, no treatment or additional diagnostic test is not an appropriate recommendation at this time.

B: Cecal inflammation with abscess

Explanation: A critical consideration that arises with the current scenario is the possibility of infection or inflammation associated with the recent angiogram and stent placement in the right common iliac artery. From the provided CT scan findings, a gas-containing abscess suggests a localized infection. The location of the abscess coupled with the patient’s fever and nausea could point to an inflammatory process within the gastrointestinal system, possibly in the cecum, rather than a problem with appendicitis or the transplanted pancreas, or a hematoma. Appendicitis usually presents with right lower quadrant pain, the patient did not undergo any recent pancreas-related procedures that could lead to iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis, and hematomas do not typically contain gas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cecal inflammation with abscess (choice B).

D: Appendiceal intussusception.

Explanation: Appendiceal intussusception is a rare condition that can present with symptoms similar to those of other diseases. The symptoms reported by the patient, including right lower quadrant pain and the absence of other symptoms usually associated with appendicitis (fever, leukocytosis) point towards a different diagnosis. While a CT scan or ultrasound might not clearly identify this condition, MRI can provide more detailed information. In this case, the MRI showed a suspicious structure within the cecum, not an inflamed appendix or a clear-cut sign of other conditions listed in the options. During the laparoscopic exploration, it became necessary to perform an ileocecectomy, further suggesting an abnormality in the appendix. Finally, the positive progesterone receptor immunostaining observed in the histologic analysis of the resected appendix is commonly found in cases of appendiceal intussusception. While complications did occur postoperatively, these are not uncommon in any surgical intervention, and they do not specifically point towards any of the other conditions listed. Therefore, the best diagnosis in this case is Appendiceal intussusception.

A: Do not intervene; the condition is benign

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a hard, nodular, midline palatal protuberance that has been enlarging slowly over decades is typical of Torus Palatinus, a benign anomaly. This condition often presents in middle-aged or older individuals and women are more frequently affected. It is usually asymptomatic and is commonly discovered as an incidental finding during a routine dental examination. Concerns for malignancy should be raised if the mass was recently noticed, enlarges rapidly, or is associated with pain or ulceration, none of which are present in this patient. As there is no associated morbidity with this condition, no intervention is generally required unless it interferes with the placement of dentures, at which case surgical removal can be performed. Referring this patient to an oral surgeon for evaluation and dental x-rays or performing a biopsy on the lesion would not be necessary initially given his presentation.

A: Do not intervene; the condition is benign

Explanation: The patient's findings of a slow-growing, nontender, symmetric, nodular bony protuberance on the midline of the hard palate are consistent with Torus palatinus, which is a benign lesion that is often discovered on routine dental examination. It is more common in females and in certain populations (eg, Inuit, Asian). Although the etiology is not well understood, both genetic and environmental factors likely play a role. Environmental factors may include masticatory hyperfunction (eg, bruxism), and hence, Torus palatinus can be associated with mandibular tori (bony exostosis along the buccal aspect of the mandible). The Torus palatinus itself is asymptomatic, and treatment (eg, surgical resection) is reserved for those who are symptomatic (eg, interference with speech, eating, fitting of dentures) or for those in whom the lesion progressively enlarges. Although this patient is concerned about its growth during the past year, reassurance and annual monitoring are all that are required. Biopsy is unnecessary due to the characteristic clinical findings, and this practice should be discouraged due to the risk of postprocedure complications (eg, infection, bleeding).

A: Do not intervene; the condition is benign.

Explanation: 

The patient's physical examination findings, specifically the slowly enlarging nontender, symmetric, hard, bony protuberance on the midline of the hard palate, along with the bilateral maxillary tuberosity protuberances, are consistent with torus palatinus and torus mandibularis. These are nonpathogenic hard tissue growths of unknown cause, seen more frequently in women and often first noted in middle age. They are usually discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging for other conditions. Because they are benign and slow-growing, they require no intervention unless they become symptomatic (eg, interfering with speech, swallowing, or fitting of dentures) or their appearance is concerning or unacceptable to the patient. At that point, surgical intervention would be considered.

B: Recommend punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate 

Explanation: Given the possible suspicion for melanoma due to the widened and darkened pigmented band, along with pigment spread to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin, a punch biopsy of the nail bed through the intact nail plate would be the most appropriate next step. This procedure would allow for the evaluation of potential melanoma cells, which could not be effectively done with the other options. Reassuring the patient without further investigation might risk missing a serious condition such as subungual melanoma. While removing the entire nail plate could also allow for broad sampling, it is more invasive and might not be necessary if the biopsy results are benign. Similarly, sending clippings of the free edge of the nail plate may not be sufficiently diagnostic and could delay definitive diagnosis and management.

B: Check for hypertension. 

Explanation: The patient is presenting with signs of hypertensive retinopathy, which include cotton-wool spots and retinal hemorrhages. Further, patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk for portal hypertension, which can also involve the retinal vessels. Checking blood pressure will help to confirm or rule out hypertension and guide further management. The other options may not be immediately relevant. Checking hemoglobin A1c is usually for monitoring diabetes, which the patient has no known history of. Interferon therapy can cause retinopathy, but usually in the form of retinal vein obstruction or ischemic retinopathy, neither of which is apparent from the examination findings. Contacting the patient's hepatologist, though possibly part of interdisciplinary management, does not directly approach the new visual symptoms.

Explanation: Postscabetic acropustulosis is a rare condition that can occur in infants and young children following treatment for scabies. Despite successful treatment of the initial scabies infestation, the child develops a new rash of papules and pustules. The presentation described is consistent with postscabetic acropustulosis, including the history of recent scabies exposure and treatment, the localisation of the lesions predominantly on the back, the relative sparing of other areas of the body, and the persistence and worsening of symptoms despite scabies treatment. The condition is usually self-limiting and typically resolves within a few months of onset.

B: Angioleiomyoma

Explanation: Angioleiomyomas (or vascular leiomyomas) are benign tumors that originate from the smooth muscle cells of vessel walls, typically restricted to subcutaneous tissues of the extremities. In this case, the circumferential configuration of the lesion around the hepatic artery is suggestive of an originating vessel. The histology and immunohistochemical staining are also classic for leiomyoma, with bundles of smooth muscle cells showing strong cytoplasmic staining for desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate filament found in smooth muscle cells. The absence of cytologic atypia, necrosis, and mitotic activity rules out malignant conditions such as leiomysarcoma or angiosarcoma. Furthermore, the absence of S100 staining and normal cells upon fine-needle aspiration makes a neuroendocrine tumor less likely. A hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm would typically appear as a well-defined, saccular, or fusiform outpouching from the artery, not a disperse growth surrounding it. Hence, given these clinical, radiological, and pathological features, the diagnosis of a hepatic artery angioleiomyoma is most consistent.

B: Rectal prolapse. 

Explanation: The symptoms detailed in the case, including an exteriorized mass through the anal canal covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, and absence of digestive lumen inside the mass, along with absence of intestinal gas or stools for 2 days are indicative of a rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse occurs when the rectum, the last part of the large intestine, loses attachment inside the body and protrudes through the anus, effectively turning itself inside out. The presence of vomiting and distended abdomen may indicate bowel obstruction, possibly secondary to the prolapsed rectum. The absence of hernia, neoplasm indications, or hemorrhoid symptoms further support the diagnosis of rectal prolapse. The other mentioned conditions (Hedrocele, Anal neoplasm, External hemorrhoids) typically present differently and their symptoms do not align as well with the patient's presentation.

C: Perform a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm for pathologic evaluation

Explanation: The presentation described is consistent with erythema multiforme (EM), a hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections like Herpes simplex and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as drugs. EM typically presents with targetoid lesions and may also involve mucous membranes, often with oral erosions or ulcerations. It is crucial to confirm the diagnosis through skin biopsy for pathological evaluation. Other tests such as chest radiograph or rapid plasma reagin test are unlikely to be helpful in this case as there is no mention of respiratory or systemic symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or syphilis, respectively. Viral culture from a lip lesion may help identify herpes simplex as a potential trigger, but it would not confirm the diagnosis of EM. Hence, the best next step would be to perform a skin biopsy.

C: Perform a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm for pathologic evaluation.

Explanation: The targetoid lesions and oral ulcers in this patient are suggestive of erythema multiforme (EM), the vast majority of cases being triggered by a previous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or medications. As the patient has no medication history, HSV is the most likely etiologic factor. Given the absence of systemic symptoms such as fever, myalgias and arthralgias, her EM is likely minor. Major EM typically involves at least two mucous membranes and is often associated with systemic symptoms. Although HSV is often implicated in EM, the goals of evaluation are to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other similar appearing conditions: atypical Stevens-Johnson syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, drug reactions, and other bullous disorders. A skin biopsy for pathologic examination will provide the most information in this regard. Ordering a chest radiograph or rapid plasma reagin test should not be prioritized as the presentation is not suggestive of a respiratory or syphilitic infection, respectively. A viral culture from a lip lesion can be performed, but HSV infection is usually diagnosed clinically or via PCR; culture can take longer and is often less sensitive.

C

Explanation: The described clinical presentation strongly suggests erythema multiforme, a self-limiting, immune-mediated condition commonly triggered by an infection such as herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or medications. Erythema multiforme is characterized by targetoid lesions, typically on the palms and soles, face, and extremities. Mucosal involvement may lead to oral, ocular, and genital erosions. If the patient has widespread mucosal involvement and skin detachment, the condition is termed Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, not erythema multiforme. Skin biopsy is the best method for diagnosing erythema multiforme, therefore, choosing option C: Performing a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion for pathologic evaluation is most suitable. Ordering a chest radiograph (option A) is usually done for pulmonary symptoms or signs. Rapid plasma reagin test (option B) is suitable if syphilis is suspected. Viral culture from the lip lesion (option D) can be helpful to identify the trigger (often herpes simplex), but it does not help in confirming the diagnosis.

C

Explanation: Considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to rituximab treatment and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, it's crucial not to exclude any potential cause of the skin lesions. Both bacterial and fungal infections can occur in immunocompromised individuals, so it would be prudent to opt for the most comprehensive testing. Both bacterial and fungal cultures from the affected areas should be obtained and treatment for both bacterial and fungal infections should be initiated until culture results are obtained.
A: Inquire about family cancer history and order genetic testing. 

Explanation: The presence of multiple Pigmented Ocular Fundus Lesions (POFLs), findings consistent with combined retinal-RPE hamartomas and focal macular thickening could be suggestive of syndromes with a recognized increased risk of malignancy, such as Cowden syndrome (CS) or Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS). Thus, it would be prudent to inquire about family cancer history and consider genetic testing to help guide future surveillance for associated malignancies. The other options, B: Offer pars plana vitrectomy and retinal biopsy, C: Offer diode laser treatment to lesions, and D: Metastatic workup, may not be necessary at this stage and could entail unnecessary risks or interventions.

D: Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and medical history, which include prolonged use of minocycline, are consistent with minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (cPAN). This condition is known to often present with erythematous nodules or plaques, ulcers, and livedo reticularis on the lower extremities. The non-indurated, violaceous, reticulated patches overlying the skin on the patient's lower front legs are clinical signs of this condition. Moreover, the ulcer with an erythematous, raised border on the lower part of her right shin and her systemic symptoms such as myalgia, polyarthralgia, and joint stiffness suggests systemic involvement, which is often seen in cPAN. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, both signs of inflammation, and the serum IgG levels also support this diagnosis. In addition, the negative result culture of the lesion and the high titers antinuclear antibody also points to an autoimmune etiology. Minocycline is known to cause drug-induced lupus and vasculitis, especially cPAN.

A: Biliary cystadenomas

Explanation: The patient's age, presentation with dull abdominal pain, and imaging findings of complex multiloculated cystic lesions in the liver point to the diagnosis of biliary cystadenomas. Biliary cystadenomas are rare, benign cystic tumors most typically found in middle-aged women and can cause symptoms due to their size and location within the abdomen. The fact that atypical cells were found on biopsy would also support this diagnosis. By contrast, in the case of an amebic liver abscess, one would expect to see a history of exposure to poor sanitation, diarrhea, or recent travel outside the country. Cystic metastasis and hepatocellular carcinomas usually present with weight loss, loss of appetite, signs of liver failure, or elevated tumor markers, none of which were reported in this case.

B. Spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall

Explanation: The patient's clinical history and findings suggest the development of a spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall. Spindle cell sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that are characterized by the presence of elongated, spindle-shaped tumor cells. These tumors can develop in various parts of the body, but when they occur in the chest wall, they often arise in the context of prior radiation treatment. This seems to be the case for the patient described above, who previously received 60 Gy of radiation treatment to the left breast and axillary basin for the management of an invasive ductal carcinoma. The mass is distinct from the left breast parenchyma, not accompanied by axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and has metabolic activity on PET scan, consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's previous mammogram was unremarkable and distant metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma was ruled out by PET scan. Lastly, desmoid tumors are slow-growing benign fibrous neoplasms and would be unexpected in this clinical scenario.
C: Perform an incisional skin biopsy 

Explanation: Given the patient's the presentation of recurrent painful subcutaneous nodules associated with pancreatitis, and the lab findings of elevated serum levels of lipase and amylase, the most likely diagnosis is pancreatic panniculitis. This is a rare condition, seen in less than 2% of patients with pancreatic disorders. Typically, it appears as erythematous, tender subcutaneous nodules that may ulcerate and extrude an oily, brownish discharge composed of necrotic fat (fat necrosis). Pancreatic panniculitis usually presents on the lower extremities but can be seen on the trunk, upper extremities, scalp, and face. Diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy, which shows lobular panniculitis with anuclear adipocytes (fat necrosis) and ghost cells (saponification of fat necrosis). 

Blood cultures would likely be normal; patients with pancreatic panniculitis are commonly afebrile and without leukocytosis. The lesions are also not infectious. A chest and abdominal CT scan would be unnecessary; apart from the known hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatitis, there is no clinical suspicion for other thoracic or abdominal disease. A PPD test would also be unnecessary as there is no clinical suspicion for tuberculosis. Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient would be to perform a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

C: Erythema chronicum migrans. 

Explanation: The presentation of slowly expanding, hyperpigmented, ringlike lesions with a tendency towards central clearing on the patient's cheek is highly suggestive of Erythema chronicum migrans, which is the early skin manifestation of Lyme disease. The fact that patient's rash was resistant to various treatments but presented some improvement supports this diagnosis. In addition, this presentation doesn't suit well with other choices. Nummular eczema usually leads to coin-shaped lesions which is not mentioned. Erythema annulare centrifugum often has trailing scale which is also not mentioned. While tinea incognito usually responds to antifungal treatments which was not effective here. Thus, Erythema chronicum migrans appears to be the most fitting diagnosis.

A: Glucagonoma

Explanation: Glucagonoma is a rare type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This diagnosis is more likely due to the symptoms of the 66-year-old man which includes diabetes mellitus, diffuse ulcerated skin rash (necrolytic migratory erythema), significant weight loss, and weakness (cachexia). These are common symptoms of glucagonoma syndrome. While other conditions such as skin amyloidosis or VIPoma can present with a skin rash, they don't typically present with the patient’s constellation of symptoms such as diabetes and cachexia. Similarly, insulinomas are usually associated with symptoms of hypoglycemia, which is not indicated in this patient’s history. Thus, the clinical scenario provided points more towards a diagnosis of glucagonoma.

C: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy 

Explanation: The clinical picture and histopathologic findings reveal Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy (also known as calciphylaxis). It is characterized by painful and progressive cutaneous necrosis, which mostly affects patients with end-stage renal disease. Despite the patient's anticoagulant therapy, necrosis and thrombotic tendencies suggest a condition like calciphylaxis. Furthermore, the patient's pronounced weakness and difficulties in mobility are additional symptoms that are commonly associated with this condition. The patient's skin biopsy telling of dermal intravascular thrombi and calcifications also support this diagnosis.

C: Perform angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery.

Explanation: This patient has fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vasculopathy that predominantly affects the renal and internal carotid arteries. The “string of beads” appearance seen on angiography is a characteristic finding in the medial form of FMD, which is the most common type. Patients with FMD often present with hypertension (due to renal artery involvement) and with symptoms related to ischemia distal to the stenosis (eg, claudication due to external iliac artery involvement, as in this patient). Management of the hypertension in patients with FMD includes percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty. In contrast to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, stenting is usually not required in FMD because the disease often affects the mid and distal parts of the renal artery, and the lesions are more responsive to balloon angioplasty alone. Given her lifestyle-limiting exertional buttock and thigh pain due to long-segment external iliac artery stenosis, she should also undergo angioplasty with stenting of these lesions. Although iliac stenting has not been studied specifically in patients with FMD, it is the treatment of choice in patients with atherosclerotic iliac disease and is likely beneficial in patients with FMD.

B: Ecthyma gangrenosum 

Explanation: The presence of skin lesions, leukopenia, and neutropenia in a newborn with a fever strongly suggest a severe bacterial infection, particularly one caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is known to cause ecthyma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a serious skin infection usually associated with immune suppression or severe neutropenia and often occurs in people with poor immunity. The mother's hepatitis C virus infection, drug addiction, and unsupervised pregnancy increase the infant's risk of such an infection. Furthermore, the rapid progression of the skin lesions and their subsequent ulceration and necrosis are indicative of ecthyma gangrenosum. The other conditions listed - Pyoderma gangrenosum, Wegener granulomatosis and Meningococcemia- are less likely in the light of infection markers present and the overall clinical presentation of the newborn.

C: Internal iliac artery aneurysm

Explanation: The patient's physical examination reveals a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant with significant perineal ecchymosis, which suggests a hematoma. His lab results reveal an elevated international normalized ratio, indicating that he has a blood clotting impairment as a result of the warfarin sodium treatment he's been receiving. The patient also has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Given his history and symptomatology, the most likely diagnosis is an internal iliac artery aneurysm. The aneurysm could have burst, leading to a hematoma in the pelvis and causing the displacement of the bladder and rectum observed in the computed tomographic images. The remaining three options are less likely because they do not fully account for the patient's symptomatology and radiographic findings.

A: A. Pulmonary aspergilloma

Explanation: The most plausible diagnosis given the patient history, clinical findings, radiological findings, and surgical findings is pulmonary aspergilloma. This condition is typically characterized by the presence of a fungus ball within a lung cavity. It is often associated with persistent, intermittent, or recurrent cough and hemoptysis, and a history of underlying lung disease, such as the patient's long-standing history of smoking. The characteristic air-crescent sign on the CT scan and the appearance of the ball-like mass with an air crescent sign in the left upper lobe suggest this diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's sputum culture was negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungi, excluding pulmonary tuberculosis and fungal infections. The absence of an endobronchial lesion detected during bronchoscopy makes the possibility of a squamous cell carcinoma unlikely. Pulmonary hydatid cyst, although it may also present with a cavitary lesion, is generally characterized by a completely different clinical and radiological presentation.

C: Postpone treatment; obtain a brain biopsy including the leptomeninges.

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms, along with abnormal laboratory findings, such as high ESR, sIL2R, LDH, anemia, and β2-microglobulin, evidence of multiple brain infarctions, and intracranial vessel irregularities, strongly suggest a systemic disease. Cerebral vasculitis could be a possible diagnosis. However, given the non-specificity of these findings, definitive diagnosis through a brain biopsy including the leptomeninges is necessary before initiating treatment. Biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of isolated central nervous system vasculitis. Another reasonable step might have been option D, particularly if there were systemic symptoms or signs, but given only evidence of central nervous system disease, it seems most appropriate to sample the site of known active disease. Antiplatelet agents might be used in vasculitis, but there are insufficient data to suggest this is the best first step without clear diagnosis. Starting corticosteroids could complicate the interpretation of the biopsy results.

B: Obtain blister fluid culture, Gram stain, and viral polymerase chain reaction assay 

Explanation: The lack of systemic symptoms and the patient's overall wellbeing is inconsistent with a severe drug reaction or systemic disease. However, the annular vesiculobullous morphology and progression suggest a possible infectious cause. Bacterial, herpesvirus, or enterovirus infection can present with vesicles or bullae. Initial management in patients with unclear etiology vesiculobullous eruptions usually involves identification of the possible infectious agent which can include culture, Gram stain and PCR assay of blister fluid. Therefore, it is appropriate to opt for obtaining blister fluid culture, Gram stain and viral polymerase chain reaction assay.

D: Extended workup. 

Explanation: The presence of yellow-white multisized subretinal lesions in the right eye with no inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber or vitreous, along with the history of photopsias and the pattern of vision changes, suggests the presence of a noninflammatory retinal disease. The findings are not consistent with a typical white dot syndrome. An extended workup that includes optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography would be appropriate to better assess and understand the nature of these lesions. There's also a need to exclude any neoplastic or paraneoplastic conditions considering the patient's age and the atypical presentation.

Explanation: Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn is a rare, benign complex cutaneous hamartoma. It is typically present at birth or becomes apparent during early childhood. With the onset of puberty, secondary changes such as an increase in size, change in color, and development of a verrucous texture often occur, consistent with what was observed in this patient. Moreover, its location on the face, specifically the scalp or face, aligns with the typical presentation of Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn. Other options like congenital melanocytic nevus and epidermal nevus generally do not demonstrate significant changes at puberty. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus is usually more inflammatory and pruritic, which was not reported in this case.

B: Ileocecal intussusception

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the findings on abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography suggest the diagnosis of ileocecal intussusception. Intussusception occurs when a segment of the bowel (intussusceptum) telescopes into the adjacent segment (intussuscipiens). The classic "donut sign" on ultrasound and the finding of a tubular thin-walled filling defect in the cecum and ascending colon on CT scan are consistent with this diagnosis. It is usually observed in children, but can occasionally be found in adults. The patient's symptoms, including intermittent, colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and loose stools without any noticeable mucus or blood, are also suggestive of intussusception. Moreover, the absence of any signs of bowel obstruction on imaging supports this diagnosis. The other listed conditions represent possible differentials, however, their typical imaging findings and associated symptomatology do not align as closely with the provided case details as ileocecal intussusception.

C: Type 1 choledochal cyst. Explanation: The Type 1 choledochal cyst typically presents as a cystic dilation of the common bile duct, which can be similar to the cystic abnormality in the region of the porta hepatis noted in this patient's imaging results. Although all options may present with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, the imaging results more likely suggest a Type 1 choledochal cyst than a duplicate gallbladder or a biliary cystadenoma, which are typically associated with gallbladder abnormalities or neoplasms, respectively. Moreover, Hydatid cyst is parasitic infection that is highly unlikely without any related patient's travel or exposure history. Additionally, the mildly elevated amylase level may also be associated with the choledochal cyst.

B: Obtain radiographs of the mandible

Explanation: The woman in question has undergone zoledronate treatment, which is associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Before proceeding with any type of invasive intervention, it's critical to first conduct further investigations to determine the extent of the bone exposure and damage. A radiograph will provide insight into the ∼ degree, severity and location of the lesion, which would then help devising an appropriate treatment plan. Treatment may include symptom management, surgical removal of the affected bone, or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It's also important to manage the patient's expectations as the bone damage caused by ONJ might be irreversible. Treatment usually mitigates symptoms, but may not fully reverse osteonecrosis. Extraction of the teeth followed by gingival graft, right away, without investigating the degree of bone exposure/damage first, may actually worsen the jaw necrosis. So, it is not considered as the initial step. A non-surgical option like prescribing antibiotics and mouthwash could be considered as part of the treatment once the extent of damage is known and depending on the patient's overall health condition.

A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, painless blurred vision, presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and dilated examination findings of the right eye show signs of a possible optic neuritis or other neurological condition that would affect the optic nerve. Thus, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits can provide useful diagnostic information. It can help identify any potential demyelinating diseases, tumours, vascular anomalies or other abnormalities that could be affecting the optic nerve. The other options are less likely: Use of antibiotics would be advised if there were symptoms of an infection, which is not the case. Steroids are a treatment option after diagnostic confirmation for conditions like optic neuritis but are not the first line of action. Serological tests are usually conducted when the cause of symptoms is suspected to be an infectious disease, again, which seems less likely in this context.
C: Proboscis lateralis

Explanation: Proboscis lateralis is a rare craniofacial anomaly characterized by a trunklike structure protruding from the normal location of the nasal cavity, and can occur bilaterally or unilaterally. Other attributes detailed in the case, such as the absence of any other associated craniofacial abnormality and normal nasal cavities, also align with features of proboscis lateralis. Supernumerary nostril often presents with a third nostril, nasal encephalocele often has associated intracranial connections, and cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome is associated with other deformities. Thus, Proboscis lateralis fits best given the information provided.

B: Gossypiboma

Explanation: Gossypiboma, which is a mass resulting from a forgotten surgical textile, can cause symptoms years later or remain asymptomatic. It presents on CT scans as a mass with a usually well-defined, thin, dense, calcium-like wall and an internal heterogeneous appearance. The patient's history of a cesarean section along with the diagnostic findings would highly suggest this condition. The mass, if it contains air bubbles and radiopaque markers, aids the diagnosis. However, the absence of these signs does not rule out a gossypiboma. Given this clinical setting, the other options are less likely.
B

1502
B: Pheochromocytoma

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal distension, early satiety, heat intolerance, and orthostatic hypotension, point towards an underlying endocrine issue. A pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands, can cause these symptoms. The large, heterogeneous, and immobile mass detected during the abdominal exam and visualized on the coronal imaging would be consistent with this diagnosis. The surgical resection further supports the presence of a significant physical tumor. Lymphomas and rhabdomyosarcomas would present with additional systemic symptoms, and pancreatic neoplasms would typically cause pain, jaundice, or digestive problems, which have not been reported in this case. Therefore, the pheochromocytoma is the most probable diagnosis.

1503
B: Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology. 

Explanation:

The history and physical exam findings don't clearly align with a common dermatologic condition, which makes definitive diagnosis and treatment planning challenging without additional information. The lesion manifested after a puncture wound, has been unresponsive to topical corticosteroid, has persisted over the years without remission, and displays distinctive physical characteristics not typically associated with common inflammatory or eczematous skin conditions. In such a situation, a tissue biopsy would offer the most valuable information regarding the pathology of this lesion and subsequently guide its most effective management. Complete excision without biopsy (A) is inadvisable as that might inadvertently discard vital information about the underlying disease process or potential malignancy. Dermatologic ultrasonography (C) may provide additional information, but a biopsy is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Finally, given the lesion's resistance to past topical corticosteroid use, stronger topical steroid treatment (D) is unlikely to be beneficial until a definitive diagnosis is achieved.

A: Broaden coverage with intravenous antibiotics and proceed with cholecystectomy

Explanation: The patient's condition and lab findings indicate a systemic infection with further decline due to loss of blood. His white blood cell count is greatly elevated, indicating a severe infection, and his hemoglobin level has dropped significantly. Moreover, the finding of an abnormal gallbladder on the CT scan might suggest acute cholecystitis, a complication that can occur in critically ill patients and adds another source of infection and sepsis. Broadening the coverage of antibiotics would help to treat the potential gallbladder infection, and cholecystectomy would remove the source of infection. The procedure also has the additional benefit of controlling the possible gallbladder bleeding which might be the source of his blood loss, thereby addressing his anemia. While endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may provide further valuable information, it would not be immediately helpful for his severe sepsis. Immediately proceeding to cholecystectomy after broadening antibiotic coverage would be a direct response to his ongoing symptoms and findings.

1505
C: Linear IgA dermatosis

Explanation: The patient's condition is most likely Linear IgA dermatosis, a rare autoimmune skin disease that typically presents as pruritic, bullous lesions on lower limbs first, making the choice C the most likely diagnosis. The distribution of lesions in the described girl, unsuccessful antibiotic treatment, their tense nature, and the normal results of blood analysis and specific antibody tests make a bacterial infection, celiac disease, and other blistering diseases less likely. Herpetiform dermatitis generally presents symmetrically on extensor surfaces and is associated with gluten sensitivity, but anti-transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies were negative in this patient. Pemphigus could present with such lesions, but the lack of mucosal involvement and the normal lymphocyte count argue against this diagnosis. Erythema multiforme often presents after infection or medication exposure, neither of which was present in this case.

C: Spontaneous rupture of the spleen. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination results, notably severe abdominal pain, left shoulder pain (referred pain due to diaphragmatic irritation), and a distended abdomen with diffused peritoneal signs, along with recent history of a viral illness strongly suggest spontaneous rupture of the spleen. Splenic rupture is often associated with trauma, but can occur spontaneously after a viral illness due to inflammation and splenic enlargement. In this case, while the other options could present with abdominal pain, they are less likely given the patient's presenting symptoms, rapid onset after a viral illness, and absence of other typical features (such as history of atherosclerosis, anterior abdominal mass, jaundice).

B: Acute appendiceal diverticulitis

Explanation: The clinical features and investigative findings characterized by the presence of a thickened wall outpouching from the appendix with an inflamed surrounding fat strongly suggest acute appendiceal diverticulitis. This condition closely mimics acute appendicitis but occurs when a diverticulum of the appendix becomes inflamed or infected. A diverticulum is an outpouching or protrusion from the wall of the organ. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia, and increased levels of C-reactive protein may indicate an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process. Furthermore, the patient showed positive results for the Blumberg sign, which is suggestive of peritoneal irritation, often seen in conditions like appendicitis or diverticulitis.

D

Explanation:
The patient's skin findings and symptoms suggest a serious vascular or hematologic condition which could be related to her chemotherapy or malignancy. These eschars, or dead pieces of skin, suggest underlying ischemia or infarction. Given the history of chemotherapy, drug-induced vasculopathy including calciphylaxis should be in the differential diagnosis. Drug-induced vasculitis is a known side effect of several chemotherapeutic agents, although it is very rare. Oftentimes a skin biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis. So option D: "Perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation" would be the most appropriate next step to identify the underlying cause of her skin lesions. 

CT scan (option A) is not likely to identify the cause of superficial skin condition. Urine toxicology screen (option B) seems inappropriate considering the patient's profile and she already denied the use of illicit substances. Ultrasound of the lower extremities (option C) could be useful if a deep venous thrombosis was suspected, but the symptoms and physical exam make this less likely.
D

1509
B: Obtain a bacterial culture from the pustules. 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of erythematous papules, scalp pustules and hair loss, all following chemotherapy, indicate a likely infection, possibly bacterial folliculitis. Both the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib and erlotinib are known to occasionally cause adverse cutaneous reactions. The failure of the potassium hydroxide prep to detect a fungal infection supports the hypothesis of bacterial folliculitis. A bacterial culture would allow for bacterial identification and appropriate antibiotic treatment. Folliculitis could exacerbate cancer patients’ symptoms and affect quality of life, so this should not be left to resolve on its own. A Tzanck smear is typically used to detect herpesvirus or varicella-zoster virus infections, which seem less likely in this scenario. While a skin biopsy could also diagnose folliculitis, it is more invasive compared to a bacterial culture and could also delay timely treatment.

D: Perform rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing from a vesicle.

Explanation: The vesicular rash in a neonate raises concern for a viral etiology, likely neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. It presents typically with skin, eye and/or mouth disease or as disseminated infection involving multiple organs. In an infant with vesicles, even in the absence of a history of maternal HSV infection, rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing or swab polymerase chain reaction of a vesicle is the preferred diagnostic test. In cases with exposure history, such as genital or orolabial lesions in the birth mother, initiation of empiric acyclovir treatment should not be delayed by testing.

D: Obtain a detailed list of the patient’s medications.
 
Explanation: One of the common causes of acute bilateral angle closure is an anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drug use. This type of glaucoma is more likely to occur in patients who have small, hyperopic eyes in which the lens vault is high and anterior chamber depth is shallow. These medications lead to pupillary dilatation that pushes the peripheral iris forward, thereby closing the angle and raising intraocular pressure. It is hence crucial to obtain a detailed list of the patient’s medications in order to identify whether this could be the cause of her symptoms.

C: Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa

Explanation: The clinical and histopathological features are characteristic of virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS), a disorder associated with polyomavirus infection that predominantly affects immunosuppressed individuals, particularly those with hematologic malignancies or organ transplant recipients. The distinctive clinical features include the appearance of numerous, tiny, spiny papules, particularly on the face, with loss of eyebrows and eyelashes but sparing of the scalp. Histology typically shows dysplastic hair follicle infundibula with excessive maturation of the inner root sheath. Treatment is difficult and often unsuccessful, with various modalities providing inconsistent results. The mainstay of management is reduction of immunosuppression when possible.

A: Acute cholecystitis

Explanation: The clinical scenario of abdominal pain with acute tenderness to palpation localized to the right upper and lower quadrants along with nausea and vomiting typically indicates the gallbladder pathology. Considering the age of the patient, an ultrasonographic finding gives a concern which indicates inflammation of the gallbladder and this suggests acute cholecystitis. Also, acute cholecystitis often requires hospitalization and it is common in older adults who have gallstones. Thus, option A: Acute cholecystitis is the most suitable diagnosis here.

C: Perform laparoscopic appendectomy

Explanation: The clinical presentation, physical examination, laboratory results, and radiological findings suggest acute appendicitis. The patient's symptoms - abdominal pain that increased over time, along with nausea and emesis - combined with physical examination findings of specific localized tenderness and a positive psoas sign suggests a definitive inflamed appendix. Leukocytosis supports the diagnosis as an inflammatory response. While other conditions can lead to similar symptoms and CT findings, acute appendicitis is the most probable diagnosis. An early laparoscopic appendectomy is recommended in the case of uncomplicated acute appendicitis to prevent progression to perforation or abscess formation and to reduce the length of hospital stay.

1515
B: Proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months.

Explanation: This patient’s constellation of findings is consistent with abdominal pseudohernia, a condition characterized by a bulging abdominal wall in the absence of a true hernia noted on imaging or surgery. It is typically a late complication of herpes zoster with abdominal wall involvement, with onset days to weeks following rash development. The T11-T12 dermatomes commonly are affected, as in this patient.

Antiviral agents are not administered after the initial 72 hours of symptoms because their efficacy is most pronounced when initiated within this time frame. However, when a patient is immunocompromised, treatment should be considered even if initiated after 72 hours in order to reduce the risk of complications, including visceral dissemination and chronic pain.

Although not proven, progressive segmental weakness or paralysis of the abdominal wall due to postherpetic poliomyelitis is thought to be the cause. The physical examination findings can be similar to those of a true hernia, with distention or protrusion of the abdominal wall that is typically more prominent on standing, coughing, straining or during Valsalva maneuver. The protrusion often is reducible and may increase in size over months to years, eventually stabilizing and then decreasing. Treatment is expectant, as the condition usually improves over months to years.

D

Explanation: In the given case, the foreign body is likely to be a bullet which was fired into the right mandible and is now lodged in the right chest. The dry cough of the patient indicates possible injury to his airways or lungs. While options A, B, and C may be relevant in some cases, in this situation the foreign body needs to be identified and its relation to vital structures determined before any invasive management is attempted. Therefore, the most immediate step would be to perform a flexible bronchoscopy (Option D), which can confirm whether there is an injury to the airway and can also help in removing the foreign body if it is directly accessible through the bronchus. Thoracotomy (Option C) would be a suitable option if bronchoscopy does not resolve the issue or if the patient's condition worsens dramatically.
C: Order urgent serum titers of IgG and IgM for Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis.

Explanation: Given the detailed physical examination, it's challenging to determine the exact cause of the patient's vision complaints just yet. The unusual visual symptom described by the patient, along with unremarkable anterior segment and dilated examinations, may suggest a disease process affecting the retina or higher visual pathways. Although less likely, an infectious or inflammatory retinal condition should also be considered. The specific serologies requested may suggest a parasitic infection as a potential, if rarer, cause of her symptoms. Opting for Pars plana vitrectomy (A) or Photocoagulation (D) seems too aggressive given the current uncertain diagnostic picture. Systemic anthelmintic therapy (B) may potentially be used but only after an infectious etiology is confirmed. Therefore, further investigation with serologic tests (C) seems to be the most reasoned decision at this moment.
D

1518
D: Rickettsialpox

Explanation: The patient's fever, rash, and city living conditions are indicative of Rickettsialpox, a mite-borne infectious disease caused by the bacterium Rickettsia akari. Disseminated herpes simplex usually has a more severe presentation with multiple vesicles and erosions, usually around the mouth, and the patient likely would have been born to a mother with genital herpes. Primary varicella (chickenpox) typically presents with a characteristic vesicular rash sequence, beginning as red papules and progressing to vesicles then crusts, which also is not seen in this case. Staphylococcal pustulosis is often localized and commonly associated with pus-filled blisters. The histological findings, mild leukopenia, slightly elevated C-reactive protein, and the absence of other symptoms or recent sick contacts further support Rickettsialpox as the most likely diagnosis.

1519
C: Cholecystocolonic fistula 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, coupled with the results of the abdomen/pelvis scan, suggest a diagnosis of cholecystocolonic fistula. Though this condition is rare, it usually affects elderly and multi-morbid patients and can manifest with non-specific symptoms like the ones presented by the patient, making it difficult to diagnose. The presence of a pneumobilia on the scan (air within the biliary tree) is a sign of abnormal communication between the biliary duct and the gastrointestinal tract, which is characteristic of cholecystocolonic fistula. Other options are less likely: there is not enough evidence to suggest a perforated bowel, the patient's symptoms are not specific to Crohn's disease, and no gallstone obstruction has been mentioned.

C: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor

Explanation: The given findings are suggestive of a Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and can present as a large mass, as noted in the case. They can sometimes cause abdominal discomfort, distention, or pain, depending on the size and location of the tumor. While other options like hemangioma, cyst, and neurilemmoma can cause similar symptoms, the imaging findings - a partially well-circumscribed, mixed cystic and solitary mass, likely arising from the stomach - are most consistent with a GIST. Hemangiomas typically appear as highly vascular lesions, cysts show fluid-filled characteristics, and neurilemmomas are usually well-encapsulated lesions that rarely originate in the stomach. Given these factors, GIST seems to be the most probable diagnosis. However, a biopsy would be needed for a definitive diagnosis.

C: Recommend an extended esophagus myotomy.

Explanation: The case presented describes a condition known as nutcracker esophagus or hypertensive peristalsis, which is a type of esophageal motility disorder characterized by a normal frequency but incredibly high amplitude of peristalsis in the distal esophagus. It leads to symptoms such as chest pain, dysphagia, and food impaction, as seen in the patient. In severe cases where medication (like calcium channel antagonists) fails to relieve symptoms, a surgical approach, such as an extended esophageal myotomy, may be recommended. This surgery involves making cuts in the esophageal muscle to prevent excessive muscle contractions, thereby making swallowing easier. Treating only with analgesia and nutritional support or along with calcium channel antagonists may not provide a long term solution, and hence are not optimal options. An esophageal resection would be too radical for this case.

1522
C: Immunohistochemical testing

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic features are consistent with Multicentric Reticulohistiocytosis (MRH), a rare systemic non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The condition is characterized by deposition of multinucleated giant cells and histiocytes in the skin and synovium. Immunohistochemical testing (option C) would be useful in confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other histiocytic disorders. Birbeck granules would be seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and not in MRH, which align with the electron microscopy findings in this patient. Acid-fast staining (option A) tests for mycobacteria, which is not consistent with this presentation. Immunoelectron microscopy (option B) might not give more beneficial information. PAS staining (option D) is just a general stain that highlights carbohydrates, it is not used in diagnosing MRH. Therefore, Immunohistochemical staining is the best next step to confirm diagnosis.

1523
C: Hepatic abscess. 

Explanation: Given the symptoms, clinical history, and imaging findings, the most probable diagnosis is a hepatic abscess. A hepatic abscess is an encapsulated collection of suppurative material within the liver parenchyma, which can often present with systemic symptoms of fever and right upper quadrant pain as seen in this patient. The previous history of infection (pharyngitis with scarlet fever) might have caused transient bacteremia, leading to an abscess. Although the patient received antibiotic treatment for this, it may not have been effective against all germs, allowing them to form an abscess in the liver. The negative cultures might be due to the prior administration of antibiotics. The presence of a hypodense mass with multiple septa, without contrast enhancement, and containing large areas of necrosis, together with systemic inflammatory response and absence of neoplastic or parasitic markers, suggest an inflammatory origin rather than neoplastic or parasitic. Although other diagnoses cannot be completely ruled out without a biopsy or aspirate of the mass, the clinical and imaging findings are highly suggestive of a hepatic abscess. Furthermore, liver abscesses can be initially managed conservatively, with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage if necessary, before considering more invasive procedures if the abscess does not respond to these measures. This approach aligns with the lack of specific findings to suggest other diagnoses.

1524
D: Giant cell tumor

Explanation: The diagnosis in this case is most likely a Giant cell tumor. The presence of numerous osteoclastic giant cells, spindle cell infiltrates, and fragmented trabecular bone seen in the biopsy are typical features of this type of lesion. Moreover, the aggressive proliferation rate of 10%, its extension to the articular surface, and the finding of other similar lesions in the distal femur and mandible also argues towards a Giant cell tumor. This tumor is known for multi-centricity i.e., occurring at different sites, which fits the patient's presentation. The age group 20-40 years is particularly affected, which is consistent with the patient's age. The patient's normal lab results exclude the possibility of primary hyperparathyroidism, the absence of blood vessel proliferative pattern eliminates the possibility of an aneurysmatic bone cyst, and the fibrous tissue and lack of destructive, infiltrative features makes malignancy less likely.
