Title: Coin-Shaped Opacities in the Stomach Case is: A 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital for treatment of calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. His home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.Chest radiograph showing 4 rounded objects in patientâ€™s stomach.What Would You Do Next? A: Administer activated charcoal , B: Arrange endoscopy , C: Perform gastric lavage , D: Provide supportive care. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning: Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis who developed intermittent apneic episodes on hospital day 7. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.

The most likely diagnosis is that the patient has ingested foreign bodies. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of coin-shaped opacities in the stomach, such as gastric bezoars, tumors, and blood clots.

The next step in management is to arrange for endoscopy to remove the foreign bodies. Activated charcoal and gastric lavage are not indicated in this case, as they will not remove the foreign bodies. Supportive care, such as oxygen and naloxone, is also indicated.

**Answer:** B. Arrange endoscopy
api request failed
Reasoning:
The patient has four radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach, which are concerning for foreign bodies. Foreign bodies in the stomach can cause a variety of complications, including obstruction, perforation, and bleeding. The patient's history of intermittent apneic episodes and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus is concerning for a foreign body airway obstruction. Therefore, the next step in management is to arrange for endoscopy to remove the foreign bodies.
