Title: Coin-Shaped Opacities in the Stomach Case is: A 50-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital for treatment of calciphylaxis and foot cellulitis. His home medications included sevelamer and hydrocodone-acetaminophen (10 mg/325 mg) every 8 hours as needed, which was increased to every 4 hours as needed in the hospital. Hydromorphone (0.5 mg intravenously as needed) was added for breakthrough pain. He was prescribed chewable lanthanum tablets (500 mg 3 times daily) for treatment of a blood phosphate level of 8.1 mg/dL (reference, 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).On hospital day 7, the patient developed intermittent apneic episodes, during which his oxygen saturation was 80% on room air; heart rate, 86/min; and blood pressure, 106/45 mm Hg. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi and responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus. A chest radiograph showed 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach (Figure). After administration of oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal cannula and a naloxone infusion, his oxygen saturation increased to 98% and his mental status improved. The patient reported no foreign body ingestion.Chest radiograph showing 4 rounded objects in patient’s stomach.What Would You Do Next?

Title: Pediatric Patient With Persistent Postoperative Fevers After Esophageal Foreign Body Removal Case is: A healthy patient in their teens presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever (38.7 °C), neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count (22 500/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland (Figure, A and B). The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a teenager who presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count. Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done, which showed gas in the thyroid gland.

The most likely diagnosis is emphysematous thyroiditis. Emphysematous thyroiditis is a rare, noninfectious inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland that is characterized by the presence of gas within the thyroid gland. It is most commonly seen in diabetic patients and is thought to be caused by an infection of the thyroid gland with gas-forming bacteria.

The clinical features of emphysematous thyroiditis include fever, neck pain, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made with CT scan, which shows gas within the thyroid gland. Treatment is with antibiotics and steroids. The prognosis is good, with most patients making a full recovery.

**Answer:**
C. Emphysematous thyroiditis

Title: Tzanck Smear of Ulcerated Plaques Case is: A man in his 30s with AIDS presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 30s with AIDS who presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities. The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed.

The Tzanck smear is a simple diagnostic test that can be performed at the bedside to help distinguish between herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections. The test involves scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and placing the contents on a glass slide. The slide is then fixed and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. In the presence of HSV or VZV, the Tzanck smear will show characteristic changes in the keratinocytes, including ballooning of the cells and peripheralization of the nuclear material.

In this case, the Tzanck smear showed the characteristic changes of HSV infection, with ballooning of the keratinocytes and peripheralization of the nuclear material. This finding is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and supports the diagnosis of HSV infection.

Title: Progressive Cranial Neuropathy Case is: A 68-year-old man presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. His symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. He then developed progressive right facial weakness with a droop, slurred speech, and eyelid ptosis. Finally, binocular vertical and horizontal diplopia and periorbital headaches began. Trials of gabapentin and steroids provided no relief. His history was significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking.On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities.Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy. The patient has a history of melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain. The patient's symptoms of right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches are consistent with cranial nerve VII palsy, which can be caused by perineural spread of malignancy. The patient's MRI at presentation shows a mass in the right cavernous sinus, which is a common site for perineural spread of malignancy. The patient's biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic, which is often the case with perineural spread of malignancy. The patient's CSF studies showed mildly elevated protein values, which can be a non-specific finding in patients with perineural spread of malignancy.

He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).A, Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan of the head and neck at presentation showing a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm (arrowhead).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 31-year-old man with a 2-year history of intermittent itching and night sweats. He has a left cervical and inguinal mass, leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and a bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan shows a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7. Left inguinal lymph node biopsy shows partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that are positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Kimura disease, classic Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, lymphoproliferative disorder that is characterized by lymphadenopathy, angioedema, and skin lesions. It is most common in Japan and Southeast Asia, but it has been reported in other parts of the world, including the United States. The etiology of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be a T-cell-mediated disorder. The treatment of Kimura disease is not well-defined, but it may include corticosteroids, surgery, and radiation therapy.

Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are large, atypical cells with a binucleated or multinucleated nucleus. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is most common in adults, but it can occur in children. The etiology of classic Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, but it is thought to be a B-cell-mediated disorder. The treatment of classic Hodgkin lymphoma is typically with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is a type of leukemia that is characterized by the presence of immature T-lymphocytes. T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is most common in children, but it can occur in adults. The etiology of T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. The treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is typically with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions are a group of rare, hematologic disorders that are characterized by eosinophilia and the presence of a specific chromosomal translocation. The translocation involves the FIP1L1 gene and the PDGFRA gene. Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions are most common in adults, but they can occur in children. The etiology of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. The treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions is typically with chemotherapy and targeted therapy.

Based on the information presented in the case, the most likely diagnosis is myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. This is supported by the patient's history of intermittent itching and night sweats, the presence of leukocytosis with eosinophilia, the bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%, the PET/CT scan showing a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7, and the left inguinal lymph node biopsy showing partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that are positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT.

Title: A Rare Case of Idiopathic Lymphadenopathy Case is: A 28-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of painful cervical lymphadenopathy along with fever, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids was started, without improvement of symptoms. She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. Her medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory.On examination, she had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy.On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris (Figure 1). Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies.Well-defined areas of fibrinoid necrosis in paracortical areas (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×20).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: An Elderly Woman With Ventricular Tachycardia Case is: A woman in her 90s presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. She had a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with biopsy findings negative for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation. Initial vital signs included blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Electrocardiogram showed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin (Figure 1). In addition to receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride, she had correction of mild hypokalemia (3.1 mEq/L [reference range, 3.5-5.2 mEq/L]; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0). Successful arrhythmia termination occurred shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remained stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excluded pulmonary embolism but showed pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that had progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram showed severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.Patient electrocardiogram showing monomorphic regular wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block morphology, with a precordial transition at V3 and inferior axis suggesting right ventricular origin.What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient is an elderly woman with a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules. She presents with fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. Her electrocardiogram shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular origin. She has mild hypokalemia, which was corrected. Her chest computed tomographic angiography excludes pulmonary embolism but shows pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that have progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. Her echocardiogram shows severe right ventricular and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic breast cancer with cardiac involvement. The patient's ventricular tachycardia is likely due to the underlying cardiac dysfunction. The next step in management is to perform a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of the cardiac involvement and to determine if there is any evidence of a treatable cause of the ventricular tachycardia, such as a myocardial infarction or an arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. If the cardiac MRI is negative, then an electrophysiology study (EPS) can be performed to assess the patient's risk of sudden cardiac death. If the EPS is positive, then the patient may be a candidate for implantation of a cardiac defibrillator. Genetic testing is not indicated in this patient, as there is no evidence of a genetic predisposition to arrhythmias.

Title: Slow-Growing Left Scalp Mass Case is: A 27-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with primary complaints of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties when driving at night. In addition, the patient described a progressively enlarging lesion on her left scalp, which she had initially noted in high school. She denied any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the scalp lesion, and she only reported pain with prolonged pressure. On her scalp examination, a 7-cm ill-defined spongy and pulsatile mass was noted with an overlying gray patch of hair. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbit was initially performed (Figure, A and B), which demonstrated an ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion in the left frontoparietal region with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension was present. Subsequent catheter angiography (Figure, C) confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.Coronal T2-weighted (A) and postcontrast T1-weighted (B) fat-saturated images show the large left T2 hyperintense scalp lesion (double arrowheads; A and B), with underlying calvarial thickening (asterisk; A and B) without invasion, prominent vascularity (single arrowhead; A), and enhancement (B). Note the preservation of the overlying skin. Catheter angiography (C) shows the hypervascular scalp lesion being supplied by hypertrophied branches arising from the left superficial temporal and occipital arteries, with marked internal vascularity (arrowheads).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 7-cm ill-defined, spongy and pulsatile mass on her left scalp. The mass has been present since high school and has been slowly growing. The patient denies any overlying loss of hair, sharp pain, or bleeding from the lesion. On examination, the mass is noted to be hypervascular and to have underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension is present. Catheter angiography confirms the hypervascularity of the mass, which is supplied by hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries. The patient underwent biopsy, which showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.

The differential diagnosis for a scalp mass in a young adult includes arteriovenous malformation (AVM), solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), diffuse-type neurofibroma (DTN), and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). AVMs are the most common type of vascular lesion in the head and neck, and they are often congenital. SFTs are rare tumors that can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the chest and abdomen. DTNs are a type of neurofibroma that is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). DFSPs are rare, locally aggressive tumors that can occur anywhere in the skin.

The imaging findings in this case are most consistent with a DTN. The mass is ill-defined, hypervascular, and has underlying calvarial thickening. These findings are characteristic of DTNs, which are often associated with NF1. The biopsy findings are also consistent with a DTN, as the lesion showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains, which are also characteristic of DTNs.

Title: Destructive Facial Plaque and Palatal Perforation in a Middle-Aged Woman Case is: A woman in her 30s presented for evaluation of asymptomatic erythematous scaly plaques over the face and proximal extremities. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria.Examination revealed multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage (Figure, A and B). There was cervical lymphadenopathy: multiple, nontender, discrete nodes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm without any surface changes. The results of sensory examination and peripheral nerve examination were within normal limits. Respiratory examination and chest radiography results were normal. Hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin, 10.1 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]); the results of a kidney function test, a liver function test, a fasting blood glucose test, and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. Serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Punch skin biopsy was obtained for histopathologic analysis and culture (Figure, C).A, Multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring, saddle nose deformity, and necrotic lesions on the ear with loss of ear cartilage. B, Perforation of the hard palate. C, Infiltrate of foamy histiocytes and pigmented yeasts without multiaxial septation (Fontana-Masson).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Chromoblastomycosis , B: Hyalohyphomycosis , C: Blastomycosis , D: Phaeohyphomycosis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with chromoblastomycosis, a chronic fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi. The characteristic lesions of chromoblastomycosis are well-defined, brown, erythematous, scaly plaques with central scarring. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the extremities, face, and neck. In advanced cases, the lesions can become necrotic and destructive, leading to disfigurement and functional impairment.

The diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and culture results. Histopathologically, chromoblastomycosis is characterized by an infiltrate of foamy histiocytes and pigmented yeasts. The yeasts are typically round or oval, and have a thick, brown cell wall. They do not have multiaxial septation, which helps to distinguish them from other fungal infections, such as blastomycosis and phaeohyphomycosis.

The treatment of chromoblastomycosis is challenging. There is no single, effective treatment regimen, and therapy must be individualized based on the patient's clinical presentation and response to treatment. The most common treatments include surgery, antifungal therapy, and immunotherapy. Surgery is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue and to improve cosmesis. Antifungal therapy is the mainstay of treatment, and the most commonly used agents include itraconazole, fluconazole, and amphotericin B. Immunotherapy, such as interferon-gamma, has also been shown to be effective in some patients.

Title: Mastoiditis in a Patient With Seizures Case is: A 64-year-old man with a 2-year history of seizure disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) at an outside hospital with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to his ED visit, he had been treated with oral antibiotics when he presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, he denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. He received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B).Hematoxylin-eosin stain (A) and immunohistochemical stain (B) after mastoidectomy for biopsy and culture specimens.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The most likely diagnosis is acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis. This is supported by the patient's history of otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss, as well as the findings on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Mastoiditis is a bacterial infection of the mastoid air cells, which are located behind the ear. It can occur as a complication of acute otitis media, or it can develop as a primary infection. Sigmoid sinus thrombosis is a complication of mastoiditis that occurs when the infection spreads to the sigmoid sinus, a vein that drains blood from the brain. The diagnosis of mastoiditis is made based on clinical findings, including otalgia, otorrhea, and hearing loss, as well as imaging findings, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Treatment for mastoiditis includes antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery.

Title: Uvular Lesion in a 62-Year-Old Man Case is: A 62-year-old healthy man with no recent travel history or sick contacts presented with 2 weeks of midline sore throat without systemic signs, such as fever, myalgia, or rash. A physical examination, including flexible laryngoscopy, revealed cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus and ulceration of the uvula (Figure 1A).A, Nasopharyngoscopic imaging revealed infected nasal surface of uvula. B, Physical examination showed recurrent skin lesions at incision site and in the surrounding skin.Empirical treatment with augmentin and nystatin oral suspension for possible bacterial or fungal pharyngitis was unsuccessful, with symptoms worsening during the subsequent 2 weeks. Results of laboratory testing for group A Streptococcus, COVID-19, and mononucleosis were negative. A tissue biopsy was performed, and results of pathology revealed epithelial hyperplasia with suppurative granulomatous inflammation without evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. There was no evidence of fungal or acid-fast organisms. Tissue culture revealed only normal respiratory flora. Additional treatment with fluconazole, augmentin, doxycycline, omeprazole, prednisone, and bactrim failed to improve symptoms.Further exploration of the patient’s history revealed that 5 years earlier, he had traveled to Guyana in South America. After that trip, he sought medical care for multiple neck subcutaneous nodules as well as for a 4-cm focus of neck cellulitis. After failed treatment with empirical antibiotics, the largest lesion was excised. Findings of pathologic testing revealed dense granulomatous inflammation. However, results of stains for bacteria, fungus, and acid-fast bacillus were negative (Figure 1B). The remaining cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules had resolved spontaneously.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Leishmaniasis , B: Tuberculosis , C: Leprosy , D: Lethal midline granuloma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of travel to Guyana and the presence of a dense granulomatous inflammation on pathologic testing are consistent with a diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with Leishmania protozoa. The disease is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, including South America. Leishmaniasis can present with a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory testing, and/or pathologic testing. Treatment for leishmaniasis depends on the type of leishmaniasis, the severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health. Treatment options include anti-leishmanial medications, such as pentavalent antimony or amphotericin B, and/or surgery.

The patient had previously received 5 cycles of romidepsin with progression of disease, followed by 4 doses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, which was followed by partial response.

The most likely diagnosis is oral involvement of mycosis fungoides. This is supported by the patient's history of mycosis fungoides, the presence of oral lesions that are consistent with mycosis fungoides, and the absence of other findings that would suggest an alternative diagnosis.

Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by oral pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and gastrointestinal polyps. It is not associated with mycosis fungoides.

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can also occur in the oral mucosa. However, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's history and presentation.

Medication adverse effects are a possible cause of oral pigmentation. However, the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with a medication adverse effect.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is oral involvement of mycosis fungoides.

Title: Man With Disappearing Subconjunctival Foreign Body Case is: A 33-year-old man with no prior ocular problems presented to the emergency department in central Florida with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in his left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).Patient cellular phone photograph of the left eye shows an irregular serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia.Exploration of conjunctiva and removal of foreign bodyWhat Would You Do Next?

The patient is a 33-year-old man with no prior ocular problems who presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in his left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye.

A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Subconjunctival foreign body
* Conjunctival foreign body
* Allergic conjunctivitis
* Onchocerciasis

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The parasite is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blackflies. The most common clinical manifestation of onchocerciasis is onchocercal dermatitis, which is a chronic, pruritic skin rash. Onchocerciasis can also cause ocular manifestations, including conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis. In severe cases, onchocerciasis can lead to blindness.

The definitive diagnosis of onchocerciasis is made by finding microfilariae in the skin or eyes. However, microfilariae are not always present in the skin or eyes, so serological testing may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Treatment for onchocerciasis is with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). DEC is a macrocyclic lactone that kills microfilariae. Treatment with DEC can cause an inflammatory reaction, known as the Mazzotti reaction, which can be severe. Therefore, treatment with DEC should be initiated in a hospital setting.

The patient in this case should be treated with diethylcarbamazine. He should also be counseled about the risks of the Mazzotti reaction and should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of the reaction to his doctor.

Title: Gravitational Shifting of a Pigmented Iris Lesion in a Young Boy Case is: A 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion in the left eye. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye were unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt (Video). There was no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.What Would You Do Next?

Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented iris lesion includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including melanocytic nevi, melanoma, and other tumors. The presence of gravitational shifting is a characteristic feature of a cystic lesion, and the absence of other features such as corneal guttatae or edema suggests that the lesion is likely benign.

In this case, the most appropriate next step is to observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention. The lesion is small, asymptomatic, and does not appear to be malignant. There is no evidence of growth or other signs of progression. Observation will allow the lesion to be monitored for any changes over time. If the lesion does change or become symptomatic, further testing or intervention may be necessary.

Title: Amelanotic Fundus Lesion in an Older White Woman Case is: An 81-year-old White woman noted decreased vision in her left eye for 6 months. She was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for suspected choroidal melanoma. She disclosed a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. Medical history revealed cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically.On examination, visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination showed posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation showed macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining her visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness (Figure, A) were seen in the left eye.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is an 81-year-old White woman with a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. She has also had cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically.

On examination, she has visual acuity of 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. External examination shows posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation shows macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining her visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness are seen in the left eye. The mass appears elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks are seen. By ultrasonography the mass is echolucent. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there is an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes choroidal melanoma, choroidal hemangioma, and choroidal metastasis. The most likely diagnosis is choroidal melanoma given the patient's age, history of cutaneous melanoma, and the appearance of the mass on fundus examination, ultrasonography, and MRI.

The next step in management is to obtain a whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan to assess for metastatic disease. If the PET scan is negative, then the patient may be a candidate for plaque radiotherapy. If the PET scan is positive, then the patient may be a candidate for systemic therapy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 30s with progressive, multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin for more than 10 years. On close inspection, milia and a few erosions with partially detached epidermis were identified. There were no abnormalities of the mucous membranes, nails, hair, or teeth. No extracutaneous involvement was observed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD), hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP), epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP), and lichen amyloidosis (LA).

PPPD is a chronic, pruritic, papular eruption that typically affects the pretibial areas. It is more common in women than men, and it usually begins in the third or fourth decade of life. The lesions of PPPD are typically small, erythematous papules that may coalesce to form plaques. They are often pruritic, and they may be associated with xerosis, lichenification, and excoriations. The histopathology of PPPD is non-specific, and it may show spongiosis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and mild acanthosis.

HLP is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules and plaques. It is more common in men than women, and it usually begins in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The lesions of HLP are typically found on the flexor surfaces of the extremities, the trunk, and the oral mucosa. They are often pruritic, and they may be associated with burning and tingling sensations. The histopathology of HLP shows a characteristic lichenoid infiltrate of lymphocytes in the papillary dermis.

EBP is a rare, chronic, blistering skin disease that is characterized by recurrent bullae and erosions. It is more common in children than adults, and it is often associated with atopy. The lesions of EBP are typically found on the hands and feet, but they may also be found on other areas of the body. They are often pruritic, and they may be associated with pain and tenderness. The histopathology of EBP shows a subepidermal blister with a characteristic 'tombstone' appearance of the basal keratinocytes.

LA is a chronic, pruritic skin disease that is characterized by waxy, papular lesions. It is more common in older adults, and it is more common in men than women. The lesions of LA are typically found on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, the trunk, and the neck. They are often pruritic, and they may be associated with burning and tingling sensations. The histopathology of LA shows a characteristic deposition of amyloid in the papillary dermis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is PPPD. The patient's presentation is consistent with the clinical features of PPPD, and the histopathology of PPPD is non-specific. HLP, EBP, and LA are less likely diagnoses because they are not typically associated with milia.

Title: Macular Star, Optic Disc Swelling, and Lethargy in a Child Case is: A 13-year-old girl with a 7-day history of painless vision loss and central scotoma in her left eye was referred to the department of ophthalmology. Three weeks prior, she had presented with mild fever and flulike symptoms, associated with a severe frontal headache that was mildly relieved by analgesics. Her medical history was positive for relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. Findings of an ophthalmological examination 1 year prior were reported as normal.At initial examination, she was conscious but somewhat lethargic. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. Pupillary light responses, extrinsic ocular motility, anterior segment biomicroscopy, and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a bilateral sectorial macular star that was more extended in the left eye, with retinal veins slightly dilated and tortuous, attenuated arterioles, some juxta and peripapillary nerve fiber layer infarcts, and optic disc edema with marked papillary telangiectasia; in addition, some faint, small, tan-yellow dots were observed at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium in the posterior pole, some of them already grayish and with a hypopigmented halo (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography displayed elevated optic discs and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer temporal to the optic disc in both eyes and a macular neurosensory detachment in the left eye. Results of visual field testing were normal in the right eye and showed a central scotoma in the left eye.Fundus image of the right eye (A) and left eye (B) showing slight dilation of retinal veins (magenta arrowheads), intraretinal lipid deposits in the papillomacular bundle and the inferonasal macular quadrant forming an incomplete macular star (yellow arrowheads), optic disc edema and epipapillary telangiectasia (blue arrowheads), nerve fiber layer infarcts or cotton-wool nodules (green arrowheads) over the inferior margin of the optic disc in the right eye and juxta and parapapillary in the left eye, and paramacular temporal light-pigmented subretinal dots at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (white arrowheads) in both eyes, with some already scarred (pigmented dot surrounded by a pale halo; gold arrowhead).What Would You Do Next? A: Prescribe systemic corticosteroids , B: Order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis , C: Rule out brain tumor , D: Check blood pressure. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of relapsing urinary tract infections since early infancy without adequate follow-up. This suggests that she may have a urinary tract infection, which can cause inflammation of the optic nerve and lead to optic disc edema. The patient also has a 7-day history of painless vision loss and central scotoma in her left eye. This is consistent with optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can be caused by a number of things, including infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and demyelination. The patient's symptoms are most consistent with infectious neuroretinitis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve and retina caused by an infection. Infectious neuroretinitis is most commonly caused by viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. It can also be caused by bacteria, such as Lyme disease.

Answer:
The correct answer is B. The patient should be tested for infectious neuroretinitis. This can be done by ordering serologic testing for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Lyme disease. If the patient is found to have one of these infections, she should be treated with antiviral or antibiotic medications.

The other answer choices are not as likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Systemic corticosteroids are not typically used to treat infectious neuroretinitis. Brain tumors can cause optic disc edema, but they are not typically associated with vision loss and central scotoma. Blood pressure can be checked, but it is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Title: A Congenital Tongue Mass Case is: An otherwise healthy 13-month-old male was scheduled to undergo excisional biopsy of a left anterior tongue submucosal intramuscular mass (Figure 1). This firm-to-palpation mass was noted at birth and remained proportional in size with the child’s somatic growth, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter on presentation. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the mass to be uniformly solid and well circumscribed without cystic components or flow voids, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1. His head, neck, and general examination findings were otherwise normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy or additional masses.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Hemangioma , B: Rhabdomyoma , C: Rhabdomyosarcoma , D: Teratoma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is a rhabdomyoma. Rhabdomyomas are the most common benign soft tissue tumors in children, and they are often found in the head and neck region. They are usually well-circumscribed and solid, and they may be hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1-weighted MRI. The patient's history and physical examination are also consistent with a rhabdomyoma.

Answer:
B. Rhabdomyoma

Title: Rash and Poor Wound Healing After Mastectomy Case is: A 42-year-old woman with asthma, seasonal allergies, and invasive ductal breast carcinoma presented to the dermatology clinic for rash and poor wound healing 2 weeks after bilateral mastectomy. Five days after surgery, the patient noted erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites (Figure 1). Two days later, she developed an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her trunk and upper and lower extremities. A skin swab was sent for bacterial culture, and she was prescribed cefadroxil (500 mg twice daily for 1 week). The skin swab bacterial culture result was negative, and her skin findings did not improve with antibiotics. The patient reported having a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation.Erythema and crusting along incision sites surrounded by a papulovesicular rash.Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision sitePrescribe acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days)Start topical steroids and perform a skin patch testTreat with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days)What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **A. Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site.**

Reasoning:

The patient has a history of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy. This suggests that she may have a condition that affects her skin's ability to heal. A skin biopsy can help to identify the cause of the rash and to determine the best course of treatment.

The other options are not as likely to be helpful in this case. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It is not likely to be effective in treating the patient's rash, which is not caused by a viral infection. Topical steroids can be helpful in treating some types of skin rash, but they are not likely to be effective in this case, as the patient's rash is not caused by inflammation. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not likely to be effective in treating the patient's rash, as the skin swab bacterial culture result was negative.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site. This will help to identify the cause of the rash and to determine the best course of treatment.

Title: Scattered Painful Papulonodules in an Older Woman Case is: A 56-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status.Physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A). Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed (Figure, B).A, Physical examination findings demonstrate dusky and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, and extremities.

The histopathologic examination of the skin biopsy specimen revealed a necrotizing vasculitis with leukocytoclasia and perivascular fibrinoid necrosis. The tissue culture grew Fusarium spp., which was identified by lactophenol cotton blue staining of a tissue culture colony.

The clinical presentation of the patient, including the skin lesions, pulmonary infiltrates, and pericardial effusion, is consistent with disseminated fusariosis. The histopathologic findings of the skin biopsy specimen are also consistent with fusariosis. The diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis is confirmed by the growth of Fusarium spp. in tissue culture.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is an elderly man with a 3-month history of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest. He reports that the lesion has been asymptomatic but is increasing in size, with progression from his face to anterior chest. He received a diagnosis of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate 1 year prior and has been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. A partially regressive change of the palatal tumor was noted radiographically during regular follow-up 3 months previously. On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found. An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

The most likely diagnosis is radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma (RIEA). REIA is a rare but aggressive malignancy that can develop following radiation therapy for a variety of cancers. It is most commonly seen in patients who have received radiation therapy to the head and neck region, but it can also occur in other areas of the body. The exact mechanism by which REIA develops is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The clinical presentation of REIA is variable, but it typically presents as a rapidly growing mass with a violaceous or erythematous appearance. The mass may be solitary or multiple, and it may be associated with ulceration, bleeding, and pain. REIA is often misdiagnosed as a benign condition, such as a hemangioma or pyogenic granuloma, which can delay diagnosis and treatment.

The diagnosis of REIA is made by biopsy. The histopathologic features of REIA are characteristic, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with immunohistochemical staining. There is no cure for REIA, and treatment is aimed at palliation and control of the disease. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. The prognosis for patients with REIA is poor, with a median survival of approximately 12 months.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 16-year-old girl with a 6-month history of a red tumor on her right upper arm. The tumor is protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined. It is also bullalike, meaning that it has a fluid-filled blister. Inside the tumor, there is a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule. There is no regional lymphadenopathy. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests are normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination. The histopathologic examination revealed basophilic cells and shadow cells as well as dilated lymphatic vessels.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pilomatricoma. Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare, benign tumor of the hair follicle. It is most common in children and young adults. The tumor is typically located on the head and neck, but it can occur anywhere on the body. The tumor is usually solitary, but it can be multiple.

The clinical presentation of bullous pilomatricoma is variable. The tumor may be asymptomatic or it may cause pain, tenderness, or pruritus. The tumor is typically a small, raised nodule that is often red or purple. It may be cystic or bullous.

The diagnosis of bullous pilomatricoma is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic examination. The tumor is typically excised completely. The prognosis is excellent.

Endoscopy revealed clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a connective tissue disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of dysphagia, Raynaud phenomenon, and a positive antinuclear antibody test are all suggestive of SLE. The patient's pulmonary infiltrates could be due to an underlying infection, such as pneumonia, or they could be a manifestation of SLE.

The next step in management is to perform a percutaneous lung biopsy to obtain a tissue diagnosis. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of SLE and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. If the biopsy results are positive for SLE, the patient will need to be treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 15-year-old male with dysphagia to solid foods and dyspnea when lying on the right side that has been progressive for 8 months. He denies pain, aspiration, noisy breathing, obstructive episodes, dysphonia, and weight loss. A physical examination reveals fullness in the left oropharynx and left level 3 of the neck. Findings of flexible laryngoscopy showed a submucosal mass in the left oropharynx extending inferiorly into the hypopharynx, obliterating the left pyriform sinus, abutting the base of tongue with hooding over the epiglottis. The supraglottis and glottis were unremarkable. Computed tomography imaging with contrast of the neck revealed a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. The most common benign tumors of the oropharynx and hypopharynx are schwannomas, neurofibromas, and hemangiomas. Malignant tumors of the oropharynx and hypopharynx include squamous cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and lymphoma.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing and painless. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. Schwannomas are often solitary tumors, but they can also occur in multiple locations (multifocal schwannomas).

The patient's CT scan findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of schwannoma. Schwannomas are typically well-circumscribed, lobulated masses that enhance with contrast. They are often cystic or have cystic components. Schwannomas typically have clear planes separating them from the surrounding structures, which is what is seen on the patient's CT scan.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is schwannoma.

A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan reveals an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases.

The differential diagnosis for a left shoulder mass in a 46-year-old man includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including:

* Benign:
    * Lipoma
    * Neurofibroma
    * Hemangioma
    * Lymphangioma
* Malignant:
    * Squamous cell carcinoma
    * Basal cell carcinoma
    * Melanoma
    * Merkel cell carcinoma

The most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell carcinoma. This is based on the following findings:

* The patient is a middle-aged man, which is the peak age group for squamous cell carcinoma.
* The lesion began as a maculopapular lesion and progressed over time, which is a typical presentation for squamous cell carcinoma.
* The lesion is located on the shoulder, which is a common site for squamous cell carcinoma.
* The biopsy shows sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells, which is a characteristic finding of squamous cell carcinoma.
* The immunohistochemistry demonstrates SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells, which is a further supportive finding for squamous cell carcinoma.
* The positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan reveals an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, which is consistent with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the diagnosis in this case is most likely squamous cell carcinoma.

Title: “Retinal Vasculitis” With Bilateral Retinal Detachments Case is: A 68-year-old man with a remote history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy, was referred for worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas. The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells.At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. His visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed debris at the vitreoretinal interface (Figure 1B).Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography on presentation demonstrate retinal vasculitis and vitritis (right eye results shown). A, Fluorescein angiography shows dense vitritis, predominantly arteriole leakage (arrowheads), and nonperfusion. Inset is a magnified view, with arrowheads pointing to arteriole leakage.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **A: Vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime.**

The patient has bilateral retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments. The most likely cause of this is a drug reaction to cabozantinib, a medication used to treat renal cell carcinoma. The first step in management is to stop cabozantinib and admit the patient for intravenous solumedrol. However, this patient has already had his cabozantinib therapy discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. In addition, his visual acuity is 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, which suggests that the retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments are already advanced. Therefore, the most urgent intervention is to treat the retinal vasculitis with vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. This will help to prevent further progression of the retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments.

Reasoning:

The patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma, as well as his recent initiation of cabozantinib therapy, are all risk factors for drug-induced retinal vasculitis. The patient's presentation with bilateral retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments is consistent with this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's visual acuity is 20/500 OD and hand motions OS suggests that the retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments are already advanced. Therefore, the most urgent intervention is to treat the retinal vasculitis with vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. This will help to prevent further progression of the retinal vasculitis and retinal detachments.

Title: Radiographic Absence of the Left Humeral Head Case is: A 67-year-old man with thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and history of frequent falls presented to the emergency department with 2 months of left shoulder pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and numbness and paresthesias in his left upper extremity. Ten years prior to presentation, he underwent surgical decompression for syringomyelia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his cervical and thoracic spine performed 2 years prior to presentation revealed a recurrent syrinx extending from C1 to T11, which was not resected because it did not cause symptoms at that time. On physical examination, he had mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder with abduction and flexion limited to 120° (normal range of motion, 180°). The left scapular muscles were atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation were reduced in his proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of his left shoulder. His complete blood cell count, serum glucose levels, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Results of tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative. Left shoulder radiograph showed complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification (Figure 1). A chest radiograph taken 2 years prior revealed a normal left shoulder joint. The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment.Anteroposterior radiograph of the patient’s left shoulder demonstrating complete destruction of the proximal humeral head.What Would You Do Next? A: Obtain MRI of the left shoulder , B: Order serum tumor marker testing , C: Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery , D: Perform an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient has a history of syringomyelia, which is a condition that can cause progressive destruction of the spinal cord. This can lead to weakness, numbness, and pain in the arms and legs. In the patient's case, the syrinx has extended into the cervical and thoracic spine, which is likely causing the symptoms in his left arm.

The patient also has a history of recurrent falls. This is concerning for a number of reasons. First, it is possible that the falls have caused further damage to the spinal cord. Second, the falls may be a sign of instability in the left shoulder joint. Third, the falls may be a sign of underlying medical conditions, such as osteoporosis or Parkinson's disease.

The physical examination findings are consistent with the patient's history and clinical presentation. The patient has mild tenderness to palpation and reduced range of motion of the left shoulder. The left scapular muscles are atrophic, and pain and temperature sensation are reduced in his proximal left arm, and dorsal aspect of his left shoulder. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of syringomyelia.

The laboratory findings are normal. This suggests that the patient does not have an acute infection or inflammatory condition.

The chest radiograph is normal. This suggests that the patient does not have a pulmonary embolism or other thoracic condition.

The left shoulder radiograph shows complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of avascular necrosis of the humeral head.

Avascular necrosis is a condition that occurs when the blood supply to a bone is interrupted. This can lead to the death of bone cells and the collapse of the bone. Avascular necrosis can occur in any bone, but it is most common in the hips, knees, and shoulders.

The most common cause of avascular necrosis is trauma. However, it can also be caused by other conditions, such as alcoholism, steroid use, and certain medications.

There is no cure for avascular necrosis. However, treatment can help to prevent further damage to the bone and improve function. Treatment options include surgery, physical therapy, and medications.

In the patient's case, the best course of action is to obtain an MRI of the left shoulder. This will allow the doctor to better assess the extent of the damage to the humeral head and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

If the MRI confirms the diagnosis of avascular necrosis, the doctor will likely recommend surgery to replace the humeral head. This is a major surgery, but it can be very effective in relieving pain and improving function.

Title: Management of Postpartum Left Main Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Case is: A woman in her early 40s, gravida 3, para 3, with a history of migraines and recurrent preeclampsia and who was 11 weeks post partum presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City. She was noted to have tachycardia (110 beats/min) and hypoxemia (90% receiving room air) with a blood pressure of 106/81 mm Hg. Cardiac, respiratory, and pulse examination results were unremarkable. She denied any clear physical or emotional triggers preceding presentation. Before presentation, the patient reported good health with satisfactory employment-mandated routine physical examinations. She denied a history of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She was not taking hormonal birth control or hormone therapy. Laboratory values demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and metabolic panel. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable. A computed tomographic chest scan excluded pulmonary embolism but suggested pulmonary and interstitial edema. Results of an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions, subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6. Initial high-sensitivity troponin was 110 000 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her early 40s, gravida 3, para 3, with a history of migraines and recurrent preeclampsia and who was 11 weeks post partum presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City.

Results of cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery (Figure 1 and Video).

SCAD is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the wall of a coronary artery causes blood to flow between the layers of the artery wall. This can block the flow of blood to the heart muscle, leading to chest pain, heart attack, and sudden cardiac death.

The management of SCAD is controversial. Some experts recommend immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while others recommend medical management with antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. The decision of whether to proceed with PCI or medical management should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's age, comorbidities, and angiographic findings.

In this case, the patient is a young woman with a history of migraines and recurrent preeclampsia. She is also 11 weeks post partum, which is a time when the risk of SCAD is increased. She presents with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea that started several hours after a flight from Florida to New York City. She has tachycardia, hypoxemia, and a mildly elevated troponin level. Cardiac catheterization reveals SCAD of the left main coronary artery.

Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and angiographic findings, I would recommend immediate PCI. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon catheter into the coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. This can restore blood flow to the heart muscle and improve the patient's prognosis.

In addition to PCI, the patient will also need to be treated with antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. Antiplatelet therapy helps to prevent blood clots from forming, while anticoagulation therapy helps to prevent blood clots from getting bigger. The patient will also need to be monitored closely for signs of heart failure or other complications.

The patient's prognosis is generally good with prompt diagnosis and treatment. However, SCAD can be a life-threatening condition, and the patient should be aware of the risks and potential complications of the treatment.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is most consistent with drug-induced SCLE. This is a rare autoimmune disease that is characterized by annular or polycyclic erythematous plaques on the sun-exposed skin. The lesions are often associated with fever, malaise, and arthralgias. The diagnosis is made by skin biopsy, which shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis. The most common drugs associated with drug-induced SCLE are antihypertensives, such as hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and antibiotics, such as minocycline and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Treatment consists of discontinuing the offending drug and starting systemic corticosteroids.

Title: Progressive Generalized Skin Laxity in a Young Woman Case is: A Chinese woman in her late 20s presented with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. In early childhood, she had developed asymptomatic yellowish coalesced papules confined to flexural areas. Subsequently, severe skin sagging occurred on her abdomen with loss of elasticity, then spread extensively with developmental growth. The results of a physical examination showed thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs (Figure, A), with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The patient had no extracutaneous involvement and was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. However, her younger sister had developed the same skin symptoms. Coagulation-related tests indicated a low clotting activity of factor X (52.2%; reference range, 77%-131%) and a prolonged prothrombin time (12.8 seconds; reference range, 10.4-12.6 seconds). The results of other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results were normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from her neck for histopathologic examination (Figure, B).A, Clinical image of the neck, axillae, and abdomen.

Reasoning:
The patient is a young woman with a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity. She also has a family history of the condition, as her younger sister has developed the same skin symptoms. The physical examination shows thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs, with yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. Coagulation-related tests indicate a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time. The results of other laboratory investigations are unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results are normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from her neck for histopathologic examination, which showed excessive calcification of elastic fiber fragments scattered in the reticular dermis.

Based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is a rare, inherited disorder of connective tissue characterized by progressive calcification of elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. The skin changes are typically the most noticeable feature of PXE, and they can include loose, wrinkled skin, yellowish papules, and telangiectasias. The eye changes can include angioid streaks (linear streaks of blood vessels in the retina), retinal hemorrhages, and cataracts. The cardiovascular changes can include premature coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysms, and mitral valve prolapse.

The diagnosis of PXE is made based on the characteristic clinical findings and confirmed by skin biopsy. There is no cure for PXE, but treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and complications of the disease. This may include treatment for cardiovascular disease, eye disease, and skin problems.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, which are all common hosts for Echinococcus granulosus, the parasite that causes hydatid disease. The patient's clinical presentation is also consistent with hydatid disease, including fever, cough, and lethargy. The CT scan findings of a ruptured pulmonary cyst and multiple liver cysts are also consistent with hydatid disease.

Answer: B. Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies. Serologic testing is the most sensitive and specific test for hydatid disease. A positive serologic test result is highly suggestive of hydatid disease, and can be used to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

If the serologic test result is negative, further testing may be necessary, such as a lung biopsy or liver biopsy. However, serologic testing is the first-line test for hydatid disease.

Title: Heart Failure, Neuropathy, and Spinal Stenosis Case is: A 60-year-old Black patient presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, 3 months of toe numbness, and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months. The patient also had a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. On presentation, blood pressure was 104/73 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, hypoesthesia below the knees, and ankle plantar flexion strength of 3 of 5 based on the Medical Research Council Scale for muscle strength. Laboratory testing revealed a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L (reference, <34 ng/L); brain-type natriuretic peptide, 112 pmol/L (reference, <30 pmol/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 51 U/L (0.85 μkat/L) (reference, 0-35 U/L [0-0.58 μkat/L]); and alanine aminotransferase, 76 U/L (1.27 μkat/L) (reference, 0-45 U/L [0-0.75 μkat/L]). A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly without pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema.An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where electromyography results included reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials, consistent with axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Coronary angiography showed no coronary atherosclerosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Results of serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain testing were normal. A bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99m–labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake (Figure).Anterior (left) and posterior (right) bone scintigraphy scan of the patient.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** Based on the information provided in the case, the most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including heart failure, neuropathy, and spinal stenosis.

To confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis, a bone marrow biopsy is typically performed. This procedure involves removing a small sample of bone marrow from the hip or sternum. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for amyloid deposits.

Genetic testing may also be ordered to look for mutations that are associated with amyloidosis. However, genetic testing is not always necessary to make the diagnosis.

Random skin biopsies are not typically performed to diagnose amyloidosis. However, they may be ordered if there is a suspicion of amyloidosis in a patient with skin lesions.

24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins is not typically used to diagnose amyloidosis. However, it may be ordered if there is a suspicion of multiple myeloma, which is a type of cancer that can cause amyloidosis.

Title: Red Eye and Choroidal Detachment in an Older Woman Case is: A 64-year-old woman presented with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. There was no history of trauma. Her medical history was unremarkable.On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/60 OD and  20/25 OS. The anterior segment showed dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels (Figure 1), a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision were normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy revealed an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes’ extraocular movements were full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination showed a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally (Figure 1), and the fundus in the left eye was unremarkable.Slitlamp photograph of the right eye showing corkscrew episcleral vessels (A) and ultra-wide field imaging of the right eye showing a large choroidal detachment nasally and shallow detachment all around (B).Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiographyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a 360° serous choroidal detachment in the right eye. This is a rare condition that is most commonly seen in patients with uveitis, trauma, or tumors. It is important to rule out these underlying causes in order to determine the best course of treatment.

Answer: D. Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography (MRA or DSA) is the best test to rule out underlying causes of choroidal detachment, such as uveitis, trauma, or tumors. These tests can provide detailed images of the eye and surrounding structures, which can help to identify the cause of the choroidal detachment and guide treatment.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a useful test for evaluating the anterior segment of the eye, but it is not as helpful in diagnosing choroidal detachment. Uveitis workup and steroids are appropriate treatments for uveitis-related choroidal detachment, but they are not necessary in the absence of uveitis. Thyroid profile is not necessary in the diagnosis or treatment of choroidal detachment.

Title: An Unusual Spontaneous Acute Deepening of the Anterior Chamber Case is: A 53-year-old woman presenting with a unilateral mild cortical and nuclear cataract associated with 20/32 visual acuity in her left eye was planning to undergo phacoemulsification. A few days before surgery, she noticed a sudden decrease in her left visual acuity measured at 20/80. Her eye specialist then observed a reverse pupillary block in her left eye and referred the patient to our department. At presentation, no other remarkable medical history was recorded and no precipitating factors identified. Slitlamp examination showed a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis (ie, keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare, 3+) and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. Intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 9 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography images and fundus photographs of both eyes are shown in Figure 1.While anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and fundus imaging were unremarkable for the right eye, the left anterior chamber was substantially deepened with a backbowing of the iris and an apposition to the lens, leading to a disappearance of the posterior chamber on AS-OCT scan. An inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear was present in the left eye (white arrowheads).What Would You Do Next? A: Perform peripheral iridotomy , B: Perform full-thickness sclerectomy , C: Administer intravenous corticosteroids , D: Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is A. Perform peripheral iridotomy.

The patient presented with a sudden decrease in visual acuity in her left eye associated with a reverse pupillary block and an inferior retinal detachment. Slitlamp examination showed a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. Fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear.

The most likely diagnosis is a pupillary block glaucoma secondary to the posterior synechiae. The treatment of choice is a peripheral iridotomy to relieve the pupillary block and allow aqueous humor to flow from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. This will lower the intraocular pressure and prevent further progression of the retinal detachment.

Intravenous corticosteroids may be used to treat the anterior uveitis, but they will not address the underlying cause of the glaucoma. Full-thickness sclerectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat glaucoma by creating a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor. However, it is not the first-line treatment for pupillary block glaucoma. Combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery is a surgical procedure that is used to treat both glaucoma and retinal detachment. However, it is not the first-line treatment for either condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Perform peripheral iridotomy.

Title: A Man With Kaleidoscope Vision Case is: A 63-year-old man with no ocular history and a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was referred for kaleidoscope vision. He received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete.His visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. He received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved.However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration.A, Ultra-widefield fundus photograph of the right eye showing pigmentary abnormalities (arrowhead) within and peripheral to the macula.

Reasoning: The patient's history of cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as his recent treatment with nivolumab and obinutuzumab, make him at high risk for developing posterior uveitis. The patient's presentation with kaleidoscope vision, bilateral panuveitis, and diffuse pigmentary abnormalities is consistent with posterior uveitis. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions, which is further evidence of posterior uveitis. The patient's visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in his left eye, despite receiving a course of oral steroids. This suggests that the patient's posterior uveitis is refractory to treatment with oral steroids. In light of the patient's history, presentation, and laboratory findings, I would recommend performing a pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy and chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells.

Title: Transoral Robotic Surgery for a Parapharyngeal Space Tumor Case is: A 71-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic for evaluation of a parapharyngeal space (PPS) mass that was incidentally found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face. The patient experienced left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort. The MRI results demonstrated a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted imaging, was hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration (Figure 1). A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given her ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of her PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass.Magnetic resonance imaging of the face.

Title: Unusually Unnerved Case is: A 47-year-old woman was seen with left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months. She was diagnosed as having recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and developed these symptoms after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. She was receiving oral antidiabetic agents, and her blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels.The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses (Figure 1).A, Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows T2 heterogeneous soft tissue in the maxillary sinus with perimaxillary inflammatory changes (yellow arrowhead). B, In this axial contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted (T1 + C) image, linear enhancement corresponds to expected course of buccal branch of facial nerve (VII) (white arrow). The enhancement extends medially and involves the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). P indicates parotid gland, and the yellow dashed line outlines the edge of the parotid gland. B and C, The white arrow shows the intercommunication between the auriculotemporal branch of V3 and the intraparotid facial nerve (green marker). C, Additionally, involvement of enhanced thickening is seen up to the left foramen ovale, without involvement of the trigeminal ganglion. D, In oblique sagittal images, the thick enhancing branches of the facial nerves within the left parotid gland are seen (orange arrows). The enhancement of facial nerve extends up to the stylomastoid foramen (SMF) (blue arrow), and there is subtle enhancement along its mastoid segments (MSs). Iodinated contrast medium was used.Fat stranding and enhancing soft tissue was seen in the retroantral spaces bilaterally as well as the pterygopalatine fossae. Anteriorly, enhancing soft tissue was present in premaxillary space, from which contiguous linear enhancement was seen extending to left parotid gland—along the expected course of buccal branch of left facial nerve. The entire extracranial left facial nerve proximal to this showed diffuse enhancement and thickening. Associated stylomastoid foramen widening was present with subtle enhancement along its mastoid and tympanic segments. These features were compatible with perineural extension of disease (Figure 1A and B).Additionally, there was involvement of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve via intercommunication between the auriculotemporal branch of trigeminal nerve and the intraparotid facial nerve. Diffuse enhancement and thickening was seen up to the left foramen ovale, without involvement of the trigeminal ganglion (Figure 1C and D).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary who developed left-sided facial weakness and swelling 2 months after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. She has no history of prior COVID-19 infection. On physical examination, she has left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. MRI of the brain shows no neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions, but does show mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses with perineural spread. Computed tomography sections confirm bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses.

The most likely diagnosis is maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread. This is supported by the patient's history of recurrent ovarian cancer, the presence of left-sided facial weakness and swelling, the MRI findings of mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses with perineural spread, and the CT findings of bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses.

Other possible diagnoses include schwannoma, invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) with perineural spread, and metastases from ovarian primary. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging studies.

Title: Nodule of the Midline Dorsal Tongue Case is: A 46-year-old man presented for an evaluation of a lesion on the dorsal tongue. The patient was asymptomatic and unaware of the lesion prior to it being discovered by his dentist. He underwent incisional biopsy at another institution and presented for a second opinion on the diagnosis. Overall, he was in good health with no underlying systemic diseases. Results of the most recent serologic analysis and urinalysis were also reportedly within normal limits.The extraoral examination was unremarkable, with no skin lesions, asymmetry, redness, swelling, or lymphadenopathy observed. The intraoral examination revealed an erythematous denuded area of the midline posterior dorsal tongue, with a central nodular component (Figure 1A). The nodule was firm to palpation and nontender. The remaining oral soft tissue was unremarkable. Because a biopsy specimen was already obtained, blank slides were requested from the aforementioned institution, and staining was performed in house.A, Clinical examination revealed a pink nodule in the midline dorsal tongue with surrounding atrophic papillae. B, Hematoxylin-eosin stain of the biopsy specimen showed acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules.Histologic evaluation revealed a piece of soft tissue with normal overlying epithelium. In the connective tissue, acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules was noted (Figure 1B).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Fibroma , B: Granular cell tumor , C: Median rhomboid glossitis (nodular variant) , D: Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma). Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The most likely diagnosis is localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma). This is a rare, benign condition that can occur in any part of the body, including the tongue. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the extracellular space. Amyloid is a protein that is normally found in the blood, but it can accumulate in tissues and organs when it is produced in excess. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, depending on the organ or tissue that is affected.

In the case of localized amyloidosis, the amyloid protein is deposited in the connective tissue of the tongue. This can cause a firm, nontender nodule to develop. The nodule is usually pink or red in color and may be surrounded by atrophic papillae. The overlying epithelium is usually normal.

The diagnosis of localized amyloidosis is made by biopsy. The biopsy specimen is typically stained with hematoxylin and eosin, which will show the characteristic amyloid deposits. Other stains, such as Congo red, may also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment for localized amyloidosis is usually surgical removal of the nodule. This is usually curative, although the amyloid protein may recur in the same area or in other parts of the body.

Title: Ecchymotic Plaques on the Scalp of a Man in His 80s Case is: A man in his 80s presented to the emergency department with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on his head. He denied any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use. His medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure.On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques were seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient (Figure, A). On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques were noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque was noted on the left lower back. There was no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood test results revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level was 202 U/L.

The biopsy showed a grenz zone and infiltrate extending into deeper dermis, with a cellular infiltrate of basophilic blastoid cells. The cells were positive for CD123.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes metastatic renal cell carcinoma, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, epithelioid angiosarcoma, and myeloid leukemia cutis. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a common cause of skin lesions in older adults, and it can present with violaceous plaques. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for renal cell carcinoma, and his peripheral blood test results are not consistent with metastatic disease. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that can present with skin lesions. The patient in this case has some clinical features that are consistent with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, such as his age and the presence of violaceous plaques. However, the biopsy results are not diagnostic of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Epithelioid angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that can present with skin lesions. The patient in this case has some clinical features that are consistent with epithelioid angiosarcoma, such as his age and the presence of violaceous plaques. However, the biopsy results are not diagnostic of epithelioid angiosarcoma. Myeloid leukemia cutis is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that can present with skin lesions. The patient in this case has some clinical features that are consistent with myeloid leukemia cutis, such as his age and the presence of violaceous plaques. However, the biopsy results are not diagnostic of myeloid leukemia cutis.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is myeloid leukemia cutis. Myeloid leukemia cutis is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that can present with skin lesions. The patient in this case has some clinical features that are consistent with myeloid leukemia cutis, such as his age and the presence of violaceous plaques. The biopsy results are also consistent with myeloid leukemia cutis, as they show a cellular infiltrate of basophilic blastoid cells that are positive for CD123.

Title: Fever, Pancytopenia, and Tender Erythematous Plaques in a Patient With Multiple Myeloma Case is: A man in his late 60s was referred to the dermatologic clinic with a 10-day history of fever up to 38.5 °C and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. In the previous month, he had received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone to treat a recurrence of IgG-κ multiple myeloma with a 10-year history. Physical examination showed annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present (Figure, A). Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient.

The patient is a man in his late 60s with a 10-year history of multiple myeloma who presents with a 10-day history of fever, pancytopenia, and tender erythematous plaques on the neck and trunk. The patient had recently received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen for his multiple myeloma. The physical examination shows annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—is present. Laboratory investigations find pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results are negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses.

The histopathological examination shows an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells in the superficial and mid dermis. The predominantly infiltrated cells show large, elongated, vesicular nuclei, single inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant, slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. An immunohistochemical image shows myeloperoxidase-positive cells.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma. This is supported by the patient's history of multiple myeloma, the presence of pancytopenia, the clinical presentation of annular erythematous plaques, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings.

Erythema multiforme is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history of multiple myeloma and the presence of pancytopenia. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is also a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history of multiple myeloma and the absence of fever. Cutaneous cryptococcosis is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history of multiple myeloma and the absence of fever and pancytopenia.

**Reasoning:** The patient is a 6-year-old boy who presented with headache for 1 month, seizures followed by altered consciousness for 1 day, and hypertension. The headache was described as new-onset, daily, occipital, mild to moderate in severity, and pulsating. It was occasionally severe and accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. The patient had 4 to 5 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures 1 day prior to admission. He remained unconscious for several hours and spontaneously regained consciousness over 24 hours. There was no history of fever, weight loss, limb weakness, vision impairment, or any strokelike illness. His birth and developmental history were unremarkable.

On examination, the patient's pulse rate was 80 beats per minute (regular) with all peripheral pulses palpable without any radio-femoral delay. His blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg with less than 10 mm Hg difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in other limbs. Abdominal examination revealed an abdominal bruit. Fundus examination revealed papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy. The patient was not oriented to place and time. The cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and autonomic system examination were unremarkable. Meningeal signs were absent. There was no evidence of neurocutaneous markers.

The patient's cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. The patient's computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing. The patient's repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a reversible neurological disorder that is characterized by seizures, headache, altered consciousness, and visual disturbances. It is caused by a sudden increase in blood pressure, which can lead to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels in the brain. This vasoconstriction can lead to ischemia and edema in the brain, which can cause the patient's symptoms.

The patient's imaging findings are also consistent with PRES. The bilateral white matter hyperintensity on the cranial magnetic resonance imaging is likely due to ischemia and edema in the brain. The narrowing of the right renal artery on the computed tomography angiography is likely the cause of the patient's hypertension.

The patient's treatment should be aimed at lowering the blood pressure and treating the underlying cause of the PRES. The patient's blood pressure should be lowered slowly to avoid further damage to the brain. The patient's underlying cause of hypertension, such as renovascular hypertension, should also be treated.

The patient's prognosis is generally good. The majority of patients with PRES make a full recovery. However, some patients may experience long-term neurological sequelae, such as seizures, headaches, and visual disturbances.

**Answer:** The patient's diagnosis is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
The diagnosis is **posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)** in a child with renovascular hypertension.

Reasoning:

* The patient presented with a 1-month history of headache, seizures, and altered consciousness.
* The patient had a history of hypertension.
* On examination, the patient had papilledema and changes of hypertensive retinopathy.
* The patient's cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region.
* The patient's computed tomography angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing.
* The patient's repeat cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities.

These findings are consistent with PRES, a reversible neurological disorder that is associated with hypertension. PRES is characterized by vasogenic edema in the posterior circulation, which can lead to seizures, headache, altered consciousness, and visual disturbances. The diagnosis of PRES is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by neuroimaging. Treatment of PRES is aimed at lowering blood pressure and treating the underlying cause of the hypertension. In most cases, PRES is reversible with treatment.

Atherosclerotic disease is a chronic condition that affects the arteries, causing them to narrow and harden. Atherosclerotic disease can lead to heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. The symptoms of atherosclerotic disease vary depending on the location of the affected artery.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare disorder of the arteries that can cause narrowing or dilation of the arteries. Fibromuscular dysplasia can affect any artery in the body, but it is most common in the renal arteries. The symptoms of fibromuscular dysplasia vary depending on the location of the affected artery.

Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the aorta and its major branches. Takayasu arteritis can cause narrowing, occlusion, or aneurysm formation of the affected arteries. The symptoms of Takayasu arteritis vary depending on the location of the affected artery.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are most consistent with PRES. Atherosclerotic disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, and Takayasu arteritis are less likely diagnoses in this patient.

Answer not available
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a reversible neurological disorder that is characterized by headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. It is most commonly seen in patients with hypertension, but it can also occur in patients with other conditions, such as preeclampsia, eclampsia, and autoimmune disorders. The underlying cause of PRES is thought to be vasospasm of the cerebral blood vessels, which leads to ischemia and infarction of the brain.

The patient's cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are also consistent with PRES. The MRI shows bilateral white matter hyperintensities that are more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. These white matter hyperintensities are thought to be due to ischemia and infarction of the brain.

The patient's repeat cranial MRI showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities. This finding is consistent with the reversibility of PRES.

The patient's computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing. This finding is consistent with renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertension is a condition in which the blood pressure is elevated due to narrowing of the renal arteries. The narrowing of the renal arteries can be caused by atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or Takayasu arteritis.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound revealed a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. This finding is also consistent with renovascular hypertension.

The patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging studies are most consistent with the diagnosis of PRES. PRES is a reversible neurological disorder that is characterized by headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. It is most commonly seen in patients with hypertension, but it can also occur in patients with other conditions, such as preeclampsia, eclampsia, and autoimmune disorders. The underlying cause of PRES is thought to be vasospasm of the cerebral blood vessels, which leads to ischemia and infarction of the brain.

Title: Diffuse Cutaneous Eruption Case is: A 70-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a pruritic exanthem that began on his scalp and face and spread across most of his body over a 2-month period. The patient had no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. He had no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, his temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body with several patches of unaffected skin on his trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure (Figure). He was referred to the emergency department, where laboratory testing revealed a normal complete blood cell count and normal lactate dehydrogenase level. The patient was admitted to the hospital and was treated with intravenous fluids and daily wet-wrap therapy with topical triamcinolone ointment (0.1%) applied to his trunk, arms, and legs, followed by a layer of warm, damp gauze and dry, cotton pajamas.Clinical examination at the time of presentation revealed generalized and coalescing salmon-colored plaques with “islands of sparing” on the abdomen (far left); waxy, exfoliative scale on the palms (center left) and soles (center right); and ectropion (far right).What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case presents with a pruritic exanthem that began on his scalp and face and spread across most of his body over a 2-month period. He has no fever, night sweats, fatigue, recent unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He reported no new prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements prior to the onset of the exanthem. He has no history of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or other skin disorder, and no recent viral or bacterial infection. On presentation, his temperature was 37.1 °C (98.7 °F); blood pressure, 128/86 mm Hg; heart rate, 110/min; and respiratory rate, 30/min. Physical examination revealed confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body with several patches of unaffected skin on his trunk. The patient had waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevented complete eyelid closure.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation is broad and includes a number of autoimmune and non-autoimmune disorders. Some of the more likely possibilities include:

* **Psoriasis:** Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the rapid buildup of skin cells. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including red, scaly patches that can be itchy and painful.
* **Atopic dermatitis:** Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by dry, itchy skin. It is often associated with other allergic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
* **Sjögren's syndrome:** Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva. It can cause dry eyes, dry mouth, and a variety of other symptoms.
* **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE):** SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and joint pain.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):** RA is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the joints. It can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints.
* **Vasculitis:** Vasculitis is a group of autoimmune disorders that affect the blood vessels. It can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which blood vessels are affected.
* **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL):** CTCL is a type of skin cancer that affects the T-cells. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including red, scaly patches.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient would be to obtain a skin biopsy. This would allow the pathologist to examine the skin under a microscope and look for specific changes that are characteristic of certain diseases. In addition, the pathologist could perform T-cell clonality studies, which would help to determine if the patient's skin lesions are caused by an autoimmune disorder.

If the skin biopsy results are inconclusive, the patient may need to undergo additional testing, such as laboratory tests or imaging studies. These tests may help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms and help to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

Once a diagnosis has been made, the patient can be treated with the appropriate therapy. The treatment for this patient will depend on the underlying cause of his skin lesions. For example, if the patient has psoriasis, he may be treated with topical or systemic medications that help to control the inflammation and scaling. If the patient has SLE, he may be treated with medications that suppress the immune system.

**Answer:** The correct answer is **B.** Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies.

Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient has a diffuse cutaneous eruption with several features that are concerning for a systemic autoimmune disease, including the presence of confluent salmon-colored plaques, waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet, and thickened, onycholytic nails. In addition, the patient has a history of psoriasis, which is a well-known risk factor for the development of systemic autoimmune diseases.

Based on these findings, the next step in the evaluation should be to order a myositis-specific autoantibody panel. This panel will test for the presence of antibodies that are associated with myositis, a group of autoimmune diseases that affect the muscles. If the patient is found to have a myositis-specific autoantibody, this would support the diagnosis of a systemic autoimmune disease.

Title: Black Tongue Discoloration Case is: An 80-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever and right shoulder pain. His temperature was 37.9 °C (100.2 °F); heart rate, 74/min; and blood pressure, 90/49 mm Hg. He had tenderness to palpation and decreased range of motion of his right shoulder. Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 ×  109/L (reference, 4.0-9.0 × 109/L); C-reactive protein level, 35.6 mg/dL (reference, <0.3 mg/dL), and creatine kinase level, 1036 U/L (17.30 μkat/L) (reference, 60-270 U/L [1.00-4.51 μkat/L]). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an effusion and synovial thickening with enhancement in the right shoulder joint and inflammation in the right subscapularis muscle. Gram stain of the synovial fluid revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Intravenous cefazolin therapy was initiated, and he underwent right shoulder joint arthroscopic irrigation, synovectomy, and surgical drainage for subscapularis pyomyositis. Blood and synovial fluid cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and intravenous cefazolin was continued. One week after hospitalization, the patient developed asymptomatic black discoloration of the dorsal surface of his tongue (Figure). He reported no prior lingual discoloration and did not smoke cigarettes, use chewing tobacco or illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.Elongated filiform papillae and black discoloration of patient’s tongue.What Would You Do Next? A: Measure serum cortisol level , B: Perform a tongue biopsy , C: Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care , D: Stop cefazolin. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
Black tongue discoloration is a common finding in hospitalized patients, especially those who are critically ill. It is caused by the elongation and hyperpigmentation of the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue. The condition is usually asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously within a few weeks. However, in some cases, it may be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as a nutritional deficiency, medication side effect, or infection.

In this case, the patient has a history of subscapularis pyomyositis, which is an infection of the muscle in the shoulder. The patient is also being treated with intravenous cefazolin, an antibiotic. Both of these factors increase the risk of developing black tongue discoloration.

The patient's black tongue discoloration is asymptomatic and does not appear to be caused by an underlying medical condition. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to provide reassurance and prescribe oral care. This will help to keep the tongue clean and moist, which may help to resolve the discoloration more quickly.

Title: Abnormal Eye Movements in a Young Girl Case is: A 5-year-old girl was referred to ophthalmology care for evaluation of nystagmus. Her medical history included esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. Her ocular history was notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. She had no family history of ocular disease.On examination, her visual acuity was 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction (right eye, −1.50 [2.00] × 180; left eye, −1.00 [1.50] × 180). Pupillary responses were normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus was noted (Figure 1). Specifically, 1 eye was noted to rise and intort while the other would fall and extort, followed by reversal of the vertical and torsional components in the opposite eye (Video). The optic nerve and foveal reflexes were normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe. Results of a previously obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were reported as normal.What Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **A. Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram.**

Reasoning:

* The patient has a history of esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Joubert syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by brain malformations, developmental delay, and eye movement abnormalities.
* The patient's nystagmus is alternating vertical and torsional, which is a characteristic finding of Joubert syndrome.
* The patient's brain MRI was previously reported as normal, but it is important to review the images carefully to look for any subtle abnormalities.
* An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. An abnormal ERG can be a sign of a retinal dystrophy, which is a condition that damages the photoreceptor cells in the retina.

Treatment for Joubert syndrome is supportive and may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct eye movement abnormalities or to treat other complications of the disease.

Title: Nonhealing Cutaneous Ulcers in a Patient With Myelodysplastic Syndrome Case is: A 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. Four years earlier, he started taking lenalidomide, 10 mg/d (28-day cycle), to treat worsening anemia; after 2 cycles of treatment, he became transfusion independent. Since then, he has remained stable with the same dose and schedule of lenalidomide without significant adverse effects. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility.Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable.A, Hematoxylin-eosin staining shows polymorphonuclear neutrophils admixed with scattered histiocytes and vasculatures with a prominent endothelial lining.

He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by painful, necrotic skin ulcers. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune disorders.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The white blood cell count is elevated, with a left shift. The hemoglobin level is low, and the platelet count is normal. These findings suggest an inflammatory process.

The pathologic findings from the skin biopsy are also consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The biopsy shows a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia. These findings are characteristic of pyoderma gangrenosum.

The patient's diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum. The treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum is aimed at controlling the underlying disease and treating the skin lesions. The underlying disease may be treated with medications such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, or biologic therapies. The skin lesions may be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics, as well as debridement and dressings.

Title: A 72-Year-Old Kidney Transplant Recipient With Visual Changes Case is: A 72-year-old woman was referred for an eye examination because of visual changes in the left eye. Her medical history was notable for end-stage kidney disease requiring a kidney transplant at age 50 years and a second transplant at age 65 years. She had received her medical care at outside facilities, the records of which were not available. She could not recall being given any precise diagnosis but reported having proteinuria since age 7 years. Her other medical conditions included hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, and pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection. She was taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. Her family history was unremarkable. She had 2 healthy adult children.One year after the first kidney transplant, she noted an inferior visual field defect in the left eye and was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Several years later, she underwent uncomplicated bilateral cataract procedures.Visual acuity with distance correction was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Color vision was 14/14 plates for each eye. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual field was full for the right eye and demonstrated an inferior defect for the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were notable only for bilateral pseudophakia. Both optic discs were anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye (Figure). The remainder of the posterior pole examination, including the retinal vessels, appeared normal in both eyes.The right optic disc is dysplastic, with a subtle appearance of the peripheral location of blood vessels emanating from the central disc. There is a central excavation of the left optic disc, with peripherally located blood vessels and the absence of central vessels.What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:** The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of end-stage kidney disease requiring two kidney transplants. She has proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex infection, and is taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. She presents with visual changes in the left eye. Her examination is notable for a left relative afferent pupillary defect, inferior visual field defect, and anomalous optic discs with central excavation.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's visual changes includes nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), optic neuritis, and compressive optic neuropathy. NAION is a common cause of sudden vision loss in older adults, and is often associated with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. CRVO is a less common cause of visual loss, but is more likely to occur in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular diseases. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve, and is often associated with multiple sclerosis. Compressive optic neuropathy is a rare cause of visual loss, but is more likely to occur in patients with tumors, orbital masses, or other conditions that can compress the optic nerve.

The patient's history and examination are most consistent with NAION. The presence of a left relative afferent pupillary defect and inferior visual field defect are characteristic of NAION. The anomalous optic discs with central excavation are also suggestive of NAION, but can also be seen in other conditions such as optic neuritis and compressive optic neuropathy.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This will help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's visual changes, such as CRVO, optic neuritis, and compressive optic neuropathy. The MRI scan will also help to assess the extent of the patient's optic nerve damage.

Reasoning:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas that were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. He presents with a tender, enlarging scalp lesion of 6 months’ duration. Skin examination reveals a 5-mm bright pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels located at the crown of the scalp. There was no purulent discharge or overlying skin changes. A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

On histopathologic examination, the lesion is composed of dermal-based tumor cells arranged in a vague nodular configuration. The tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin, consistent with a diagnosis of angioleiomyoma.

Angioleiomyomas are benign tumors of smooth muscle cells. They are typically located in the skin, but can also occur in other soft tissues. Angioleiomyomas are usually solitary lesions, but can be multiple. They are most common in adults, but can occur in children.

The clinical presentation of angioleiomyomas is variable. Some lesions are asymptomatic, while others may cause pain, tenderness, or bleeding. Angioleiomyomas are typically diagnosed on the basis of their clinical appearance and histopathologic findings.

The treatment of angioleiomyomas is usually not necessary, as they are benign tumors. However, if a lesion is symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable, it can be removed surgically.

Title: Multiple Erythematous-Violaceous Patches and Plaques on the Left Upper Arm and Left Side of the Chest Case is: An otherwise healthy female patient in her late 20s was seen with a 2-year history of multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, with occasional slight pain extending from her left upper arm to the left side of her chest. No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions. She denied fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination showed multiple firm, nonscaly, purple erythematous patches and plaques with irregular borders on her left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region (Figure, A). No extracutaneous involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of her chest for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).A, Multiple nonscaly, erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques with irregular borders on the patient’s left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region. B, Irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis (hematoxylin-eosin).

A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of her chest for histopathological examination, which showed irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis. The endothelial cells were plump and positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 31.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of microvenular hemangioma. Microvenular hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that are characterized by the proliferation of small, thin-walled capillaries. They are most commonly seen on the skin, but can also occur in other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lungs. Microvenular hemangiomas are typically asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause pain, swelling, or bleeding. The treatment of microvenular hemangiomas is usually not necessary, but they can be removed surgically if they are symptomatic or if they are cosmetically disfiguring.

Title: Acute Respiratory Distress Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention of Osteal Occlusion of Left Main Coronary Artery Case is: A man in his late 50s was released from a tertiary hospital with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock with onset 6 days before admission. On admission, vital signs showed blood pressure as 98/66 mm Hg while receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine from the referral hospital, a regular heart rate of 90 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peripheral oxygen saturation 96% nasal oxygen at 3 L per minute, and a temperature of 36.7° C. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries.Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields (Figure 1A). While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsaded de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema. Chest computed tomography showed a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields (Figure 1B). In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presented with acute respiratory distress following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of osteal occlusion of the left main coronary artery. He had a history of an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. He was receiving dobutamine and norepinephrine at the time of admission. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricle systolic function (estimated ejection fraction, 34%) and hypokinesia of the anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, and septal walls. Lung ultrasound demonstrated multiple B-lines in both lung fields. Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion in the left main coronary artery. PCI was successful in opening the osteal left main and drug-eluting stents were placed in the left main and left anterior descending arteries.

Following PCI, the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Electrical cardioversion was performed and a loading dose of amiodarone was administered. Chest radiography during the loading dose of amiodarone showed infiltrates in both lung fields. While in the intensive cardiovascular care unit, maintenance doses of amiodarone were continued because of episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. On the third day of hospitalization, despite adequate diuresis, the chest radiography showed persistent pulmonary edema.

In addition, hemodynamic evaluation and lung ultrasound showed no congestion and laboratory markers, including a procalcitonin level of 0.01 ng/mL, and ruled out an infectious etiology.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is used to treat a variety of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and flutter. It is also used to treat cardiomyopathy and to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction. Amiodarone is a lipophilic drug that accumulates in the lungs, liver, and thyroid gland. It can cause a variety of pulmonary toxicities, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary fibrosis, and nodular pneumonitis.

The treatment of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is discontinuation of the drug and administration of corticosteroids. In some cases, lung transplantation may be necessary.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her late 60s who presented to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. She described several other episodes occurring at rest over the past several weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was otherwise in excellent health and not taking any medications. She had no family history of syncope or sudden death. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) results were normal, but premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were noted on telemetry. Shortly thereafter, 2 episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), 30 minutes apart, were recorded, both lasting less than 4 seconds. A repeat ECG showed PVCs. Laboratory test results including serum potassium and magnesium as well as 3 serial troponin levels were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities or valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis was 1.0.

The patient's presentation is concerning for ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening. The PVCs are of particular concern because they are frequent and are associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a type of ventricular arrhythmia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, which can lead to sudden cardiac death.

The patient's coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. This stenosis is not severe enough to cause angina or other symptoms, but it could be a potential source of ventricular arrhythmias.

The patient's treatment should be aimed at preventing ventricular arrhythmias. The first step is to optimize the patient's medical therapy. This includes treating any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the arrhythmias, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and electrolyte abnormalities. In this case, the patient's coronary artery disease is being treated with medical therapy.

If medical therapy is not effective in preventing ventricular arrhythmias, the patient may need to undergo an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). An ICD is a device that is implanted in the chest and can deliver an electric shock to the heart if it detects a ventricular arrhythmia. ICDs are very effective in preventing sudden cardiac death.

In the patient's case, she has had two episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. This is a serious arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Therefore, I would recommend that she undergo an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

A: Implant a defibrillator

Title: Blurred Vision After a Kidney Transplant Case is: A patient in their mid-30s with a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations) presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.Ultra-widefield fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography of a necrotic retinal lesion in the right eye demonstrating (A) multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades with retinal lesions in the temporal periphery (arrowheads) and (B) a cross-section through a temporal lesion along the superior arcade showing full thickness retinitis (arrow).Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulinWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: Left Axilla Adenocarcinoma of Unknown Origin Case is: A 76-year-old woman presented with a palpable left axillary mass. When she was 36 years old, she underwent a hysterectomy due to abnormal uterine bleeding and was taking estradiol to control postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms for the past 20 years. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions (Figure 1A). The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 10 weeks. She then transferred her care to our center for surgical management. We requested the pathology slides for review at our laboratory and additional immunostaining was performed, which revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for PAX8 (Figure 1B), p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3.A, Magnetic resonance image of the breasts shows an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass (arrowhead) but no breast lesions.

Based on the history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary. The patient has a history of hysterectomy, which makes it unlikely that the primary tumor is in the uterus. The positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan showed only high uptake in the left axilla region, which suggests that the primary tumor is located in the left breast. The biopsy examination revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features, which is a characteristic of breast cancer. The additional immunostaining showed that the tumor cells are positive for PAX8, p53, and WT1, which are markers that are typically found in breast cancer cells.

Title: A Hump-like Neck Mass in a Child Case is: A 7-year-old boy presented with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on his left lower neck since birth. His parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (Figure, A). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI (Figure, B). The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis (Figure, C).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging findings, and histopathologic results, the most likely diagnosis is cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnants are rare congenital anomalies that arise from incomplete obliteration of the branchial clefts. They are typically located in the anterior triangle of the neck, and are composed of cartilage, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. The most common presentation is a painless, slowly growing mass. Imaging studies may show a well-defined, lobulated mass with calcification. Histopathologic examination shows cartilage, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. The treatment is surgical excision.

Title: Slow-Growing Pediatric Neck Mass Case is: An 11-year-old girl with no significant medical history was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology department for a painless, left-sided neck mass that had been slowly enlarging for 8 months. On examination, there was an easily palpable 3-cm firm, fixed, well-circumscribed left supraclavicular mass without overlying skin changes or cutaneous involvement. She had no other masses, cervical lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms. In workup for this mass, she initially underwent ultrasound imaging, which demonstrated a hypoechoic mass. Findings from fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy were inconclusive, demonstrating histiocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass of mainly soft tissue density with contrast enhancement (Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging of the left-sided supraclavicular mass. T2 sequencing with contrast demonstrates strong enhancement of the mass.Given persistence of the lesion, and inconclusive biopsies, the decision was made to pursue surgical excision. In the operating room, a well-defined 5.5-cm left level V mass was excised. The mass was found to attach deep to the middle scalene and was fed by several unnamed vessels; however, there was no involvement of the clavicle. Pathology confirmed complete excision of a well-circumscribed lesion with peripheral casing of bone, cyst-like spaces filled with serous fluid, walls of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells, thin trabeculae of woven bone surfaced with osteoblasts, and scattered macrophages. There was local infiltration into surrounding skeletal muscle, but no atypical mitoses or pleomorphic cells were identified. The lesion was positive for USP6 locus rearrangement (17p13.2) on florescence in situ hybridization.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Physical examination revealed an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on his glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures. A biopsy was performed.

The most likely diagnosis is a vellus hair cyst. Vellus hair cysts are the most common type of cyst on the penis. They are caused by the blockage of a hair follicle, which can lead to the formation of a small, fluid-filled sac. Vellus hair cysts are typically asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause pain, itching, or discharge. They are usually treated with incision and drainage, but they may also be treated with topical or oral antibiotics.

Other possible diagnoses include pilonidal sinus, cutaneous larva migrans, and median raphe cyst. Pilonidal sinus is a chronic, inflammatory condition that is caused by the infection of a hair follicle. It is most commonly seen in the sacrococcygeal region, but it can also occur in the groin area. Cutaneous larva migrans is a skin infection that is caused by the larvae of certain types of worms. It is characterized by a linear, serpiginous rash that is often accompanied by itching and inflammation. Median raphe cyst is a type of cyst that occurs in the median raphe, which is the line of fusion of the two halves of the penis during fetal development. It is typically asymptomatic, but it can sometimes cause pain, itching, or discharge.

Title: A Patient With Diabetes and Spontaneous Blistering of the Right Lower Extremity Case is: A 42-year-old man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 25 years, and gastroparesis presented to the emergency department with right lower extremity blisters that had developed spontaneously over the prior 36 hours. He reported a tingling sensation in the affected area but no pruritus or pain. He had no history of leg trauma and no chemical or extreme temperature exposure. Medications included insulin lispro (sliding scale 3 times daily) and insulin glargine (20 units nightly). On physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. His extremities were warm with palpable distal pulses. Hyperpigmented macules were present on the anterior lower legs below the knees, and tense bullae were present on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes (Figure). There was no surrounding erythema or edema, and findings on the remainder of the skin and mucocutaneous examination were unremarkable. Laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 375 mg/dL (20.81 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%.

Reasoning: The patient presents with a history of type 2 diabetes and spontaneous blistering of the right lower extremity. The blisters are tense and have no surrounding erythema or edema. The patient has no history of leg trauma or chemical or extreme temperature exposure. The physical examination is significant for hyperpigmented macules on the anterior lower legs below the knees and tense bullae on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes. The laboratory testing reveals a blood glucose level of 375 mg/dL (20.81 mmol/L) and hemoglobin A1c level of 9.8%. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes diabetic dermopathy, bullous pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris. Diabetic dermopathy is a common skin condition that occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by hyperpigmented macules and patches, which can sometimes develop into bullae. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that can affect the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of tense bullae that are often surrounded by erythema and edema. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of flaccid bullae that are often surrounded by erythema and edema.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's blistering. If the biopsy is consistent with diabetic dermopathy, then the patient can be managed with topical treatment and close follow-up. If the biopsy is consistent with bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris, then the patient will need to be started on systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

Kidney function was within normal limits. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a systemic vasculitis that typically affects patients older than 50 years of age. It is characterized by inflammation of the large and medium-sized arteries, which can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations, including headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, temporal artery tenderness, vision loss, and polymyalgia rheumatica.

The most common cause of vision loss in GCA is arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). AION is caused by occlusion of the posterior ciliary artery, which supplies blood to the optic nerve head. This results in infarction of the optic nerve head and sudden, painless vision loss.

The diagnosis of GCA is based on clinical suspicion and supported by laboratory tests, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies, such as temporal artery biopsy, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

The treatment of GCA is with high-dose corticosteroids. This therapy can help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. In some cases, immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, may be necessary.

The patient in this case should be treated with high-dose corticosteroids. She should also be referred to a rheumatologist for further management.

Title: Acute-Onset Orbital Inflammation in a Patient With Multiple Myeloma Case is: A 72-year-old male patient presented with 2 days of conjunctival injection in the right eye, chemosis, eyelid edema, and pain with eye movements. His medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis, and recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma, and he was taking daratumumab and zoledronic acid. He denied eye trauma, dental surgery, or sinus disease. Examination of the right eye was notable for visual acuity of 20/50, reduced ocular motility in all gazes, proptosis, and chemosis. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the orbits with contrast demonstrated right preseptal edema and intraorbital fat stranding of the extraconal and intraconal fat without sinus disease. Nasal endoscopy performed by the otolaryngology service showed no evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened (Figure 1A).A, External photograph of the right eye demonstrating periocular edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has acute-onset orbital inflammation in the setting of multiple myeloma. The most likely cause is orbital pseudotumor, a noninfectious inflammatory condition of the orbit. Orbital pseudotumor is typically idiopathic, but it can be associated with a variety of systemic conditions, including multiple myeloma. The initial treatment for orbital pseudotumor is corticosteroids. If the patient does not respond to corticosteroids, other treatment options may include orbital biopsy, sinus surgery, or antifungal therapy.

Answer: C. Start corticosteroids.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with orbital pseudotumor, a noninfectious inflammatory condition of the orbit. Orbital pseudotumor is typically idiopathic, but it can be associated with a variety of systemic conditions, including multiple myeloma. The initial treatment for orbital pseudotumor is corticosteroids. If the patient does not respond to corticosteroids, other treatment options may include orbital biopsy, sinus surgery, or antifungal therapy.

In this case, the patient has already been started on antibiotics, but his condition has continued to worsen. This suggests that the patient's orbital inflammation is not caused by an infection. Therefore, the next step in the patient's management should be to start corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for orbital pseudotumor. They are effective in reducing inflammation and relieving symptoms. In most cases, corticosteroids will be effective in controlling the patient's condition. However, if the patient does not respond to corticosteroids, other treatment options may be necessary.

Title: A Case of Acute Chest Pain After Acetazolamide to Treat Uncontrolled Increased Intraocular Pressure Case is: A 61-year-old Black man with hypertension and diabetes presented with decreased vision 3 months after uneventful cataract surgery in his left eye. He had undergone laser retinopexy for retinal tears in his right eye and a scleral buckle and vitrectomy for a retinal detachment in his left eye 1 year earlier. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/40 OD and counting fingers OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mm Hg in the right eye and 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while ophthalmoscopic examination showed vascular attenuation and treated retinal breaks. In the left eye, microcystic corneal edema and Descemet membrane folds limited examination, but no residual lenticular fragments or neovascularization of the iris or angle were seen. The patient was discharged taking timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine, and prednisolone. Twelve days later, the cornea had cleared and IOP in the left eye improved to 32 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed 360° of anterior synechiae and complete angle closure, which was documented on ultrasound biomicroscopy (Figure 1). The patient started treatment with 500 mg of acetazolamide daily and referred to the glaucoma service for surgical evaluation.Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrating angle closure (arrowheads).When the patient returned for his glaucoma evaluation 3 days later, he was noted to have loss of appetite, drowsiness, nausea, and malaise. The patient’s intraocular examination was stable bilaterally. During this visit, the patient developed acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency requiring immediate transfer to the emergency department. He was found to have a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0) and a hematocrit level of 22.1% (to convert to a proportion of 1.0, multiply by 0.01).Obtain blood cultures, perform vitreous tap, and inject antibioticsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency are concerning for a pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition. Blood cultures, vitreous tap, and injection of antibiotics are not indicated in this case. Laser iridotomy is a procedure that is used to open the drainage angle in the eye to reduce intraocular pressure. However, this procedure would not be helpful in the treatment of a pulmonary embolism. Observation is not an appropriate management option for a patient with acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency. The patient should be evaluated immediately by a physician to determine the cause of their symptoms and to receive appropriate treatment.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with metastatic hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. She has locally advanced disease that is invading the skin overlying her right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Her disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. She received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, she developed some redness on her hands and feet that resolved on its own. She then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on her forearms, faces, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. Her palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline. She had a history of substantial sun exposure but no history of skin cancer.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer. This is supported by the patient's history of metastatic breast cancer, the presence of a rash that is consistent with cutaneous metastases, and the lack of response to treatment with topical and systemic corticosteroids.

Other possible diagnoses include inflammation of actinic keratoses, medication hypersensitivity reaction, and discoid lupus erythematosus. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Title: A Nearly Obstructive Intratracheal Mass in a Pediatric Patient Case is: A 12-year-old girl presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of intermittent stridor. Her symptoms were initially most prominent while playing sports and were suspected to be due to asthma or seasonal allergies. However, medical management with albuterol, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine failed to provide relief. More recently, the patient’s parents noted that she developed stridor while sleeping and while at rest, prompting the family to present for medical attention.Previous workup, including pulmonary function testing, was concerning for an upper airway obstructive process, for which she was referred to otolaryngology. In-office flexible videostroboscopy revealed a mass in the distal cervical trachea that appeared nearly obstructive. Chest radiography confirmed the presence of an approximately 1.5-cm, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass within the cervical trachea.Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. This demonstrated an exophytic, pedunculated mass that emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (Figure 1A and B). The patient was intubated via Seldinger technique to bypass the mass, with a 4.0-mm cuffed endotracheal tube loaded over a 0-degree Hopkins endoscope (Figure 1C). With the airway secured, attention was turned to excision of the mass. Lidocaine, 1%, with epinephrine 1:100 000 was injected in a submucosal plane, and laryngeal scissors were used to excise the attachment of the mass from the tracheal wall. The mass was then resected en bloc and removed with laryngeal cupped forceps. The attachment site was then ablated with the Coblator (Figure 1D).Intraoperative photographs demonstrating supraglottic view of intratracheal mass (A); exophytic, pedunculated mass emanating from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea (B); endotracheal intubation via Seldinger technique bypassing the mass (C); and cervical trachea following ablation of attachment site (D).What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The most likely diagnosis is a granular cell tumor. Granular cell tumors are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the larynx and trachea. They are typically benign and slow-growing, but can occasionally be malignant. They are most commonly found in adults, but can occur in children. The typical presentation is with a hoarse voice or stridor. On examination, a mass may be seen or palpated in the larynx or trachea. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Title: Cerebrospinal Fluid in the Middle Ear in a Child Case is: A 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss was referred to a pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeon in a secondary care hospital. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.The patient was referred to our tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule (Figure 1A). There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed (Figure 1B). It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.A, Axial high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bones at the level of the basal turn of the cochlea showed osteolysis involving the petrous part of the right temporal bone. There was associated soft tissue partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. The destructive process did not involve the otic capsule. B, Coronal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and skull base, T2-weighted images showed a hypersignal in the right mastoid and middle ear with suspected communication through the tegmen.

It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.

The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed a proliferation of Langerhans cells in the mastoid bone. The Langerhans cells were positive for CD1a and S-100 protein. The diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) was made.

LCH is a rare, non-malignant disorder of the Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. LCH can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the bones, skin, and lymph nodes. The symptoms of LCH vary depending on the affected organs. In the case of this patient, the LCH involved the temporal bone, resulting in a CSF leak.

The treatment for LCH depends on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, LCH may resolve on its own. In more severe cases, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.

The prognosis for LCH is generally good. With treatment, most patients with LCH have a good long-term outcome.

Title: Numerous Ulcerated Plaques of the Trunk and Extremities in a Patient Receiving Long-term Hydroxyurea Therapy Case is: A woman in her 80s initially presented with numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. She had a medical history of essential thrombocytosis (ET), which was treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years, with a total cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g. She was otherwise reasonably well and denied any other constitutional symptoms. The ulcerations had slowly increased in number and size over several years and were quite painful (Figure, A-C). She did have a medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which had previously been treated surgically. Several tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the patient’s diagnosis.A-C, Clinical findings including widespread photodistributed ulcerated pink papules and plaques on the extremities. D, Histopathologic findings (hematoxylin-eosin stain).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 80s who has been receiving hydroxyurea therapy for essential thrombocytosis for 14 years. She has numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. The ulcerations have slowly increased in number and size over several years and are quite painful. She has a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, which has been treated surgically.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations, hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia, hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption, and iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis.

Hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations are a well-recognized side effect of hydroxyurea therapy. They typically occur in areas of skin that are exposed to sunlight, such as the face, hands, and arms. The ulcerations are often painful and can take several weeks to heal.

Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia is a precancerous condition that can develop in patients who are treated with hydroxyurea. It is characterized by abnormal cells in the skin that have the potential to become cancerous. Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia is usually treated with surgery or laser therapy.

Hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption is a type of allergic reaction that can occur in patients who are exposed to sunlight after taking hydroxyurea. The eruption is characterized by redness, swelling, and blisters on the skin. It is usually treated with topical steroids and antihistamines.

Iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a rare condition that can develop in patients who are treated with hydroxyurea. It is characterized by multiple, wart-like lesions on the skin. The lesions are usually treated with topical or oral medications.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations. This is because she has a history of hydroxyurea therapy and the ulcerations are located in areas of skin that are exposed to sunlight. The ulcerations are also painful and have been slow to heal.

Title: Long History of Multiple Painless Scalp Nodules in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A woman in her late 40s was admitted to the hospital with a 40-year history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp. At 5 years of age, the patient had developed multiple subcutaneous masses in the occipital and bilateral temporal regions. At age 10, she was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and underwent surgical resection of the tumors at a local hospital. Tumors recurred 5 years after surgery, with their size and number gradually increasing with age. Physical examination revealed scalp masses from 4 to 6 cm in diameter, with hard textures and smooth surfaces (Figure, A), and subcutaneous nodules of 1 × 1 cm to 2 × 2 cm with hard textures on the hands (Figure, B), feet, trunk, and lower extremities. The patient had no tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations. The patient had consanguineous parents, but no other family member, including her children, had the disease.A, Multiple subcutaneous masses in the occipital and bilateral temporal regions. The diameter of the scalp masses varied from 4 to 6 cm, with hard textures and smooth surfaces. B, Subcutaneous hard nodules on the hands, ranging from 1 × 1 cm to 2 × 2 cm.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a middle-aged woman with a 40-year history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp. She was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at age 10 and underwent surgical resection of the tumors at a local hospital. Tumors recurred 5 years after surgery, with their size and number gradually increasing with age. Physical examination revealed scalp masses from 4 to 6 cm in diameter, with hard textures and smooth surfaces, and subcutaneous nodules of 1 × 1 cm to 2 × 2 cm with hard textures on the hands, feet, trunk, and lower extremities. The patient had no tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations. The patient had consanguineous parents, but no other family member, including her children, had the disease.

The most likely diagnosis is neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors, including neurofibromas, which are the most common type of tumor associated with the disorder. Neurofibromas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most commonly found on the skin, nerves, and bones. The tumors can be small and harmless, or they can be large and cause significant problems.

The patient's history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp, which began in childhood and have gradually increased in size and number, is consistent with a diagnosis of NF1. The patient's physical examination findings, including the presence of scalp masses and subcutaneous nodules, are also consistent with NF1. The patient's family history is also significant, as she has consanguineous parents. This increases the risk of her having a genetic disorder, such as NF1.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's presentation includes other conditions that can cause multiple hard nodules on the skin, such as juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, lipoid proteinosis, and Mafucci syndrome. However, these conditions are less likely than NF1 in a patient with the patient's history and physical examination findings.

**Answer:**
The diagnosis is neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning: The patient's history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp that began at a young age and gradually increased in size and number is consistent with a diagnosis of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF). JHF is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple subcutaneous nodules. The nodules are typically painless and firm, and they may occur on any part of the body. JHF is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the protein SMAD3. This mutation leads to the accumulation of abnormal amounts of hyaline material in the skin and other tissues.

Title: A Woman With Recurrent Torsade de Pointes Case is: A woman in her mid-40s presented to the emergency department after a fall with head trauma. A head computed tomography showed a 0.9-cm left subdural hematoma with a mild left to right midline shift. Her ethanol level was 202 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.2171); magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.4114); potassium, 4.4 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); and ionized calcium, 4.6 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). The patient developed cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias in the emergency department and was successfully resuscitated. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no regional wall motion abnormalities. She subsequently underwent embolization of the middle meningeal artery. After embolization, however, a worsening rightward midline shift was discovered. As a result, on the 11th day of her hospitalization, she had a burr hole evacuation. During day 15 of admission, the patient had 3 episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) while receiving 50 mg of metoprolol succinate daily, and her 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.The 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained on day 15 of admission. Alternans in T-wave polarity is evident in most leads (especially V3-V6) while alternans in T-wave amplitude is seen in leads II and aVF.What Would You Do Next? A: Discontinue metoprolol, start sotalol , B: Start intravenous amiodarone , C: Start intravenous magnesium , D: Emergent implantable cardioverter defibrillator implant. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of torsade de pointes, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. She is currently taking metoprolol, a beta-blocker that can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsade de pointes. The patient's ECG shows T-wave alternans, a non-specific finding that can be seen in patients with torsade de pointes.

Answer:
The best next step is to discontinue metoprolol and start intravenous magnesium. Magnesium is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can help to shorten the QT interval. Intravenous amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can also be used to treat torsade de pointes, but it is associated with a number of potential side effects, including pulmonary fibrosis and liver toxicity. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that can be implanted in the chest to deliver an electric shock to the heart if it starts to beat irregularly. An ICD is not a first-line treatment for torsade de pointes, but it may be necessary in patients who have recurrent episodes of the arrhythmia despite treatment with other measures.

The correct answer is: C. Start intravenous magnesium.

Title: A Young Woman With Dyspnea During Cardiac Catheterization Case is: A woman in her mid-20s was evaluated for a history of dyspnea on exertion for 2 years. On physical examination, her pulse was 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. The cardiovascular examination showed a loud S1, normal S2, and an opening snap along with a mid-diastolic, soft, rumbling murmur at the apex of the heart. The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement. The echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 0.9 cm2 with a mean (SD) gradient of 20 (4) mm Hg. There was no evidence of any subvalvular thickening, leaflet calcification, or mitral regurgitation. The patient was taken for balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). A 6F pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle via the right femoral artery. The interatrial septum was punctured using a Mullins sheath and Brockenbrough needle via the right femoral vein. Entry into the left atrium was made and confirmed with a dye injection. However, suddenly, the patient developed acute onset of dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain. Her blood pressure at the time of the event was 100/60 mm Hg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The catheter was pulled back into the right atrium, and chest fluoroscopy was performed (Figure; Video).The fluoroscopy image of the patient at the time of dyspnea.What Would You Do Next? A: Pericardiocentesis , B: Intravenous thrombolysis , C: Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy , D: 100% Oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's acute onset of dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain after entry into the left atrium is concerning for cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis is the most definitive treatment for cardiac tamponade, as it allows for the removal of pericardial fluid and the relief of tamponade physiology. Intravenous thrombolysis and catheter-directed thromboembolectomy are not indicated in the setting of cardiac tamponade, as they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. 100% Oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position are supportive measures that may be used while awaiting definitive treatment. However, they are not likely to be effective in relieving the patient's symptoms in the setting of cardiac tamponade.

Title: Pigmented Corneal Lesions After Cataract Surgery Case is: An 81-year-old woman was referred to our service for assessment of 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions (Figure 1A). Two years ago, she underwent uncomplicated right cataract surgery at a different center. Her postoperative course had been complicated by persistent low-grade anterior uveitis for which she received maintenance loteprednol, 0.5%, eye drops on alternate days. She also used latanoprost eye drops at night in both eyes for primary open-angle glaucoma. Her medical history was only significant for hypertension, which was well controlled with ramipril. She denied any ocular trauma or recent travel outside of the country. Review of systems was unremarkable.Slitlamp photographs of the right eye showing 2 darkly pigmented corneal lesions (A) and the location of the lesion on the right corneal endothelium and stroma (B). The third lesion is covered by the upper eyelid.On examination, her visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressures measured 17 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. The right sclera and conjunctiva were white with 3 distinct hyperpigmented corneal lesions affecting the corneal endothelium and stroma (Figure 1B). There were 2+ cells in the anterior chamber and 1+ vitritis. Dilated fundus examination showed a normal retinal appearance.Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reactionWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of uncomplicated cataract surgery two years ago, but has since developed persistent low-grade anterior uveitis. She also has three darkly pigmented corneal lesions. The most likely cause of these lesions is fungal infection. Fungal infections can occur after cataract surgery, especially in patients with uveitis. To confirm the diagnosis, it is important to obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This will allow the identification of the specific fungal species responsible for the infection. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient can be treated with appropriate antifungal medications.

Title: A Case of Multiple Hemorrhagic Friable Nodules Case is: A man in his 50s presented with bleeding wounds and nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms. He previously received failed systemic and radiation therapy for tumor stage mycosis fungoides (MF). He had received 11 courses of extended beam radiation therapy, including 3 courses of total skin irradiation of 24 to 30 Gy, and focal irradiation to the left posterior thigh and hip/buttock with 2.5/3 Gy to 12.5/24 Gy, respectively, and the right posterior thigh and hip with 2 Gy to 20 and 26 Gy, respectively. Seven years before this visit, he underwent a reduced-intensity, matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). His post-transplant course was complicated by severe chronic graft vs host disease of the skin, eyes, and gut, for which he received systemic corticosteroid therapy, tacrolimus, methotrexate, and long-term extracorporeal photopheresis. Three years after the HSCT, he developed chronic ulcerations on the hips, back, and arms at the site of previously irradiated tumors, as well as multiple friable, hemorrhagic, and bleeding nodules on bilateral hips and his forearms while receiving treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal photopheresis. He underwent several debulking procedures and excision biopsies of the nodules, which revealed granulation tissue on histology. In this latest visit, physical examination revealed recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his left lateral hip and left lateral buttock (Figure 1). Similar nodules were noted on his right hip and forearm. The patient underwent repeated debulking and biopsy. He was also treated with micafungin, amphotericin B, levofloxacin, dapsone, acyclovir, pentamidine, penicillin VK, and posaconazole. Positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) results did not show evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease.Recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: Orbital Proptosis and Sinusitis in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 48-year-old woman presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. She also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Active medical issues included hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. Her brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling. Vital signs were unremarkable, and examination of the right eye showed moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. She had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus (Figure 1B). Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis (Figure 1C). Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.A, Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. She presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. She also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. On examination, she had moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. She had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus. Initially she was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis. Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into various organs, including the orbit. Orbital involvement in IgG4-RD can present with a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, eyelid swelling, diplopia, and vision loss. The diagnosis of IgG4-RD is based on a combination of clinical features, imaging findings, and laboratory results. Imaging studies typically show enlargement of the involved organs with diffuse or nodular soft tissue masses. Laboratory studies may show elevated levels of IgG4, IgG, and acute phase reactants. Treatment for IgG4-RD is typically with corticosteroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive medications may be necessary.

The other possible diagnoses in this patient are Graves disease, invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension, and sarcoidosis. Graves disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including hyperthyroidism, proptosis, and eyelid retraction. Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension is a rare but serious infection that can occur in patients with underlying immunosuppression. It can cause severe orbital inflammation and infection, leading to proptosis, vision loss, and even death. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect any organ in the body, including the orbit. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, eyelid swelling, and vision loss.

In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-RD. The patient's history of hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma places her at increased risk for developing IgG4-RD. The patient's presentation with right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia is consistent with IgG4-RD. The patient's imaging studies show bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding, which are also consistent with IgG4-RD. The patient's laboratory results show elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels, which are also consistent with IgG4-RD. The patient's biopsy results show nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis, which are also consistent with IgG4-RD.

Title: Lip Squamous Cell Carcinoma With Spontaneous Eruption and Drainage Case is: A 69-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed T3N2cM0 poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV) of the lower lip mucosa presented to the medical oncology clinic 3 days after initiating neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy with redness and swelling of the tumor site. Four days after treatment, a white head formed overlying the tumor that erupted through the skin surface (Figure 1). Thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10, at which point the drainage stopped spontaneously. Throughout, the patient reported no pain and remained afebrile. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth. No antibiotics were administered. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications.This photo documents clinical tumor behavior after neoadjuvant immunotherapy treatment.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Infection and suppuration , B: Immunotherapy-related inflammation , C: Tumor progression , D: Allergic reaction. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presented with redness and swelling of the tumor site 3 days after initiating neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. This is a known side effect of this type of treatment, and is thought to be due to an inflammatory response of the immune system to the tumor cells. The white head that formed overlying the tumor and erupted through the skin surface is also a common finding with this type of treatment, and is thought to be due to the breakdown of the tumor tissue as the immune system attacks it. The thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10 is also a common finding, and is thought to be due to the healing process. The patient reported no pain and remained afebrile, which suggests that the inflammation is not severe. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth, which suggests that the inflammation is not due to an infection. No antibiotics were administered, which further supports the diagnosis of immunotherapy-related inflammation. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications, which suggests that the treatment was effective.

Answer:
B. Immunotherapy-related inflammation

The patient's presentation is consistent with a known side effect of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, and the other possible diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination.
B

The differential diagnosis for a painful bruise that persists for more than 2 weeks includes pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma, hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor, pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor), and angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma.

Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma is a rare, benign neoplasm of melanocytes that typically presents as a solitary, blue-black papule or nodule on the skin. It is most common in middle-aged adults and is more common in women than men. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical appearance and histopathologic findings. Treatment is typically excision.

Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm of fat and fibrous tissue that typically presents as a solitary, painless mass on the skin. It is most common in adults, and there is no gender predilection. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical appearance and imaging findings. Treatment is typically excision.

Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) is a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm of melanocytes that typically presents as a solitary, blue-black plaque or nodule on the skin. It is most common in young adults and is more common in men than women. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical appearance and histopathologic findings. Treatment is typically excision with wide margins.

Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma is a rare, benign neoplasm of fibroblasts and histiocytes that typically presents as a solitary, painful mass on the skin. It is most common in adults, and there is no gender predilection. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical appearance and imaging findings. Treatment is typically excision.

In this case, the patient is a woman in her 30s with a painful bruise on her hand that initially appeared a few days after she sustained a twisting injury to the affected hand while participating in acroyoga 2 years before. Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain have persisted despite icing and resting the area. She denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand. Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor). This is supported by the patient's age, gender, and clinical presentation. The imaging findings are also consistent with this diagnosis. Treatment is typically excision with wide margins.

Title: One Beat Is All It Takes—Wide Complex Tachycardia in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A man in his mid-50s with a medical history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) reported new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke him from sleep. Emergency medical services found him to be in a wide complex tachycardia. He was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate his arrhythmia. He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B.

**Reasoning:**

The patient in this case has a history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on ECG, which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. He presented with new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke him from sleep, which are typical symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome. He was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia. He was administered a 150-mg bolus of intravenous amiodarone, which failed to terminate his arrhythmia. He ultimately required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J. On arrival to the emergency department, his vital signs were stable. Serum electrolyte levels were within normal range and C-reactive protein was less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). High-sensitivity troponin peaked at 1078 pg/mL. His initial 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1A. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry, as shown in Figure 1B. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments.

Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is a genetic disorder that affects the right ventricle. It is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, and fibrosis of the right ventricular myocardium. The arrhythmias associated with ARVC can be life-threatening, and sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in patients with ARVC.

The management of ARVC is aimed at preventing sudden cardiac death. This includes implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which is a device that can deliver an electric shock to terminate ventricular arrhythmias. Other treatment options for ARVC include medications to control ventricular arrhythmias and lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.

In this case, the patient should be discharged home after implantation of an ICD. He should also be started on medications to control ventricular arrhythmias and be advised to make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death.

Title: Severe Cervicodynia in a Patient With Pustules on the Palms Case is: A 51-year-old previously healthy man was admitted with severe neck pain for 6 days. In the past month, he felt neck stiffness, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, which could be transiently relieved by taking oral ibuprofen. Six days before admission, the patient’s neck stiffness transited to an endurable dull ache. When turning his head, there was severe burning pain in the posterior neck and occiput, followed immediately by an electric shocklike numbness on ipsilateral side tongue, which led to a forced head position. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with gadolinium on admission revealed signal abnormality in C1/C2 vertebrae (Figure 1A). In the past 3 days, with the intensification of neck pain, the patient found pustules on both hands, which gradually increased. He had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse. On examination, he was afebrile. There was tenderness in the right sternoclavicular articulation, upper neck, post aurem, and occiput. Multiple pustules were seen in the palm and back of both hands (Figure 1B). Complete blood cell count and liver and kidney function yielded normal results, except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 93 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.5 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10).

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of oral candidiasis, a fungal infection of the mouth. Oral candidiasis is a common infection, especially in people with weakened immune systems. It is most often caused by the fungus Candida albicans. The most common symptoms of oral candidiasis are white, curd-like plaques on the tongue, gums, or inside of the cheeks. The plaques can be painful or itchy, and they may bleed if they are scraped off. Oral candidiasis can also cause a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and bad breath.

The most common treatment for oral candidiasis is topical antifungal medication, such as nystatin or clotrimazole. Oral antifungal medication, such as fluconazole, may be necessary for more severe cases. In some cases, oral candidiasis may be caused by a systemic fungal infection, such as candidemia. Candidemia is a serious infection that requires hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antifungal medication.

In this case, the patient has a history of sexual contact with a male partner. This puts him at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including syphilis. Syphilis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Syphilis can also cause serious complications, such as heart disease, stroke, and blindness.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that cause syphilis. If the patient is found to have syphilis, he will need to be treated with antibiotics.

Title: An Amelanotic Choroidal Lesion in a 68-Year-Old Man Case is: A 68-year-old man with a history of keratoconus was referred for evaluation of a choroidal lesion in his left eye. He reported intermittent dull pain in his left eye for 1 month that improved with acetaminophen. His family history was significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (mother) and leukemia (mother and maternal grandfather). On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/200 OS, limited by keratoconus. Extraocular movements were full, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. There was no proptosis. Anterior segment examination demonstrated keratoconus with corneal scarring in both eyes and Descemet folds in the left eye. Both eyes had mixed cataract. There were no signs of anterior segment or vitreous inflammation. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an amelanotic area of choroidal thickening (confirmed by optical coherence tomography) overhanging the inferonasal margin of the optic disc with associated subretinal fluid and scattered areas of hyperpigmentation (Figure 1A). There was an additional, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypocyanescent lesions inferonasal to the disc and at the fovea.A, Montage color fundus photograph of the left eye demonstrating a 14 × 12 × 2.0-mm nasal peripapillary lesion with mottled overlying areas of hyperpigmentation (arrowheads).

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of keratoconus who presents with a choroidal lesion in his left eye. The lesion is amelanotic, which suggests that it is not a melanoma. The patient also has a family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia, which increases his risk of developing a secondary malignancy. The most likely diagnosis in this case is choroidal metastasis.

The next step in management is to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis. FNAB is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed in the office under local anesthesia. The biopsy sample can then be sent to a pathologist for evaluation.

If the biopsy results are positive for choroidal metastasis, the patient will need to be referred to a medical oncologist for further management. Treatment options for choroidal metastasis include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy.

Title: Ocular Tumor in a Woman With Breast and Kidney Carcinomas Case is: A 54-year-old White woman with a history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy as well as chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma treated with partial nephrectomy was referred for evaluation of an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in her left eye, suspicious for metastatic disease. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU and intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes at 10 mm Hg. Slitlamp biomicroscopy of the anterior chamber was within normal limits in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in the right eye and clear vitreous with a subretinal mass in the left eye inferior to the optic disc and measuring 3 × 2 mm in base. Color fundus photography of the left eye (Figure, A) showed an amelanotic lesion under the retina inferior to the optic disc and 3 mm from the foveola surrounded by a subtle orange halo. Fundus autofluorescence (Figure, B) showed the lesion to be hyperautofluorescent. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the lesion showed the mass was primarily in the sclera and pushed and thinned the overlying choroid (Figure, C).A, Color fundus photography of the left eye showing a 3 × 2-mm yellow lesion with orange halo 0.5 mm inferior to the optic disc.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 54-year-old White woman with a history of lobular breast carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy as well as chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma treated with partial nephrectomy. She is now being evaluated for an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in her left eye.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic disease from her previous breast or kidney cancer. The differential diagnosis also includes primary choroidal tumors, such as melanoma or lymphoma.

The next step in the evaluation is to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the mass. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and will also provide information about the tumor's histology and cytogenetics.

If the FNAB is positive for metastatic disease, the patient will need to be treated with systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. If the FNAB is negative, the patient will need to be monitored closely for the development of metastatic disease.

The core biopsy from the lymph node is shown in the Figure, C.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous angiosarcoma. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive malignant tumor of endothelial cells. It most commonly occurs in the skin of the head and neck, but it can also occur in other parts of the body, including the chest wall. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is typically seen in older adults, with a median age of diagnosis of 65 years. The most common presenting symptom is a rapidly growing, painless mass. Other symptoms may include bleeding, ulceration, and lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma is made on biopsy. The tumor cells are typically pleomorphic and spindle-shaped, with a high mitotic rate. Immunohistochemical staining may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor, with a median survival of 12 months. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The differential diagnosis for cutaneous angiosarcoma includes other malignant tumors of the skin, such as melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. It is important to note that cutaneous angiosarcoma can also occur in the setting of a pre-existing condition, such as lymphedema or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Surgery was approached like a neck dissection. The entire specimen was removed, including its capsule, which measured 17.0 × 14.0 × 5.0 cm. Six months later, a postsurgical magnetic resonance imaging scan showed that the fat prominence had largely been resected.

The most likely diagnosis is familial lipomatosis. Familial lipomatosis is a rare disorder characterized by the excessive accumulation of fat in the neck, trunk, and extremities. It is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The cause of familial lipomatosis is unknown, but it is thought to be due to a mutation in a gene that codes for a protein involved in fat metabolism.

The clinical features of familial lipomatosis vary depending on the extent of the fat deposition. Patients may present with a painless, slowly enlarging neck mass. The mass may cause dysphagia, airway obstruction, and cosmetic deformity. In some cases, the fat deposition may extend to the mediastinum and cause respiratory compromise.

The diagnosis of familial lipomatosis is made based on the clinical features and imaging studies. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, can show the extent of the fat deposition. There is no specific treatment for familial lipomatosis. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and improving the cosmetic appearance. Surgical removal of the fat may be necessary in some cases.

**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case presents with generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous white spicules and comedo-like plugs that were in a linear distribution on his face, trunk, and extremities since birth. Some of the eruptions on his trunk had spontaneously resolved with developmental growth. There was nonconsanguineous marriage of his parents, and no family members had similar lesions. The patient was otherwise in good general health and without developmental delay. Physical examination showed generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with numerous central small filiform keratotic white spicules and brown plugs on the head, face, neck, trunk, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figure, A and B), including his palms and soles along Blaschko lines, accompanied with alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. The examination of nails, mucosae, and teeth was unremarkable. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. Dermoscopic examination showed many central white spines on the face (Figure, C) and brown cores surrounded by yellow crater-like rings on the right palm. A skin biopsy specimen was taken from the hyperkeratotic papules with white spicules on his right thigh (Figure, D).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and dermoscopic findings, the most likely diagnosis is inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN). ILVEN is a rare, congenital skin disorder characterized by linear verrucous papules and plaques that are often associated with alopecia. The lesions are typically distributed along Blaschko lines, which are lines of skin development that are determined by the person's genes. ILVEN is thought to be caused by a mutation in the genes that control keratinocyte differentiation.

The diagnosis of ILVEN is made clinically based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. A skin biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of linear verrucous lesions, such as linear epidermal nevus sebaceus or epidermal nevus with verrucous features.

There is no cure for ILVEN, but the lesions can be treated with topical medications, such as corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions. ILVEN is a lifelong condition, but the lesions typically improve with age.

Histopathological examination of the area with intact epidermis shows dense infiltration of the ulcer bed by atypical cells. These cells were large and had characteristic grooved vesicular nuclei and moderate amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry shows diffuse positivity for CD1a in the lower epidermis and dermis.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of dendritic cell. The most common presentation of LCH is skin lesions, which can be seen in up to 80% of patients. These lesions can vary in appearance, but they are often described as reddish papules or plaques that may ulcerate. Other common features of LCH include lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone lesions. The diagnosis of LCH is made based on clinical findings and the results of histopathological and immunohistochemical testing.

The treatment of LCH depends on the extent of disease involvement. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. However, in more severe cases, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. The prognosis for patients with LCH is generally good, with most patients experiencing long-term remission.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass graft 10 years ago. He presents with recurrent presyncope and bradycardia. Review of prior physician encounters revealed reports of lightheadedness and electrocardiograms (ECGs) with atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute. Current medications include carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB). Telemetry revealed heart rates of 50 to 60 beats per minute, which did not change with activity. Findings of echocardiography were unremarkable. We reviewed a prior ECG (Figure, B).

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome is a disorder of the sinus node, the heart's natural pacemaker. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including palpitations, lightheadedness, and syncope. The diagnosis is made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as an ECG.

The ECG in Figure, A shows atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute. There is also right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB). These findings are consistent with sick sinus syndrome.

The treatment for sick sinus syndrome depends on the severity of the patient's symptoms. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In more severe cases, treatment may include medications to increase the heart rate, a pacemaker, or a combination of both.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe enough to warrant treatment. The most appropriate treatment option is a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest. It sends electrical signals to the heart to keep the heart rate at a safe level.

Title: Progressive Camptocormia With Head Drop and Dysphagia Case is: A 72-year-old man presented with mild proximal weakness developing into progressive camptocormia, head drop, and prominent dysphagia over a 2-year period. He reported a 20-kg weight loss and numbness to the ankles. His medical history was significant for thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy resulting in a chronic left accessory nerve injury, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. His medications were metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. He had no history of smoking and drank 3 glasses of wine per week. His family history was unremarkable.Examination revealed significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles with a flexed spine posture in the upright position (Figure 1A).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a 2-year history of progressive camptocormia, head drop, and dysphagia. He also has a history of thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy, resulting in a chronic left accessory nerve injury. His medical history is also significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and gout. His medications are metformin, allopurinol, perindopril, thyroxine, and rabeprazole. He has no history of smoking and drinks 3 glasses of wine per week. His family history is unremarkable.

On examination, the patient has significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles with a flexed spine posture in the upright position. He has symmetric Medical Research Council grade 4/5 weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally. He has weakness of left shoulder elevation and winging of the left scapula secondary to the accessory nerve injury. His deep tendon reflexes are normal and symmetric. Pinprick sensation is reduced in both feet.

Metabolic, endocrine, autoimmune, and infectious screens had unremarkable findings. Creatine kinase levels were normal. A myositis panel demonstrated low-positive Mi2 antibodies. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation identified a small immunoglobulin G (IgG) κ paraprotein with normal findings on bone marrow biopsy. A whole-body positron emission tomography scan was normal. Nerve conduction studies revealed a mild axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Concentric needle electromyography showed no spontaneous activity with widespread small, brief, polyphasic units, particularly in proximal and axial muscles, consistent with a myopathic process. An initial deltoid muscle biopsy did not show evidence of myopathy. Because the patient’s symptoms were worsening, a second muscle biopsy of vastus lateralis was performed. This revealed atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance (Figure 1B).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen-storage disease type 2), myasthenia gravis, paraneoplastic myositis, and sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy.

Late-onset Pompe disease is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissue. It typically presents in infancy or early childhood with hypotonia, weakness, and respiratory failure. However, late-onset Pompe disease can also present in adults with more subtle symptoms, such as muscle weakness and fatigue. The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of acid maltase activity in serum or leukocytes. Treatment is with enzyme replacement therapy, which can improve symptoms and prolong life.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness and fatigue due to the destruction of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. It typically presents in young adults with fluctuating weakness of the eyelids, face, arms, and legs. However, myasthenia gravis can also present in older adults with more generalized weakness. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptors in the blood or by a positive edrophonium test. Treatment is with anticholinesterase medications, which improve the function of the neuromuscular junction. In some cases, immunosuppression may also be necessary.

Paraneoplastic myositis is a rare condition that occurs in association with certain cancers. It is characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of antibodies to muscle-specific antigens in the blood. Treatment is directed at the underlying cancer. In some cases, immunosuppressive therapy may also be necessary.

Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of nemaline rods in muscle tissue. It typically presents in adults with muscle weakness and fatigue. The diagnosis is confirmed by muscle biopsy. There is no specific treatment for sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and assistive devices.

In the patient described above, the most likely diagnosis is sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy. This is supported by the patient's age, history of progressive camptocormia, head drop, and dysphagia, the findings on physical examination, and the results of the muscle biopsy. The other possible diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Title: Home Sleep Apnea Testing for the Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Case is: A 50-year-old woman with hypertension and epilepsy reported loud snoring associated with a 22.7-kg (50-lb) weight gain over the past 2 years. She described infrequent abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness but reported no witnessed apnea. She had fatigue but no headaches or excessive daytime sleepiness. Her blood pressure was 182/97 mm Hg, oxygen saturation was 98%, and body mass index was 51.3 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). The remainder of her physical examination findings were normal. Laboratory evaluation revealed a serum bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L (reference range, 23-29 mEq/L). The patient underwent home sleep testing using a home sleep test device. Results are presented in the Table.Advise use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position.What Would You Do Next? A: Advise use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position. , B: Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. , C: Perform laboratory-based polysomnography. , D: Repeat the home sleep apnea test.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of hypertension and epilepsy, and she has recently gained weight. She also reports loud snoring, infrequent abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness, fatigue, and a serum bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L. These findings are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Home sleep testing is a reliable method for diagnosing OSA, and the patient's home sleep test results show an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 15.5 events per hour. This is a high AHI, and it is consistent with a diagnosis of OSA.

Answer: The next step in the management of this patient is to initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. CPAP is a treatment that delivers pressurized air through a mask that is worn over the nose and mouth. The pressurized air helps to keep the airway open during sleep, which prevents apneas and hypopneas. CPAP is a safe and effective treatment for OSA, and it can improve sleep quality, reduce daytime sleepiness, and improve quality of life.

The other options are not appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Option A, advising use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position, is not a definitive treatment for OSA. Option B, initiating CPAP therapy, is the most appropriate next step. Option C, performing laboratory-based polysomnography, is not necessary because the patient has already undergone a home sleep test. Option D, repeating the home sleep apnea test, is not necessary because the patient's home sleep test results are consistent with a diagnosis of OSA.

Title: A Case of Unilateral Intraocular Pressure Elevation in a Patient With Glaucoma Case is: A 52-year-old man with a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids presented with an IOP above target of 19 to 23 mm Hg OS. He also had mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes.During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye (Figure 1).A, A 24-2 Humphrey visual field (HVF) of the left eye after tube shunt showed superior and inferior arcuate defects.

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids. He also has mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery has been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes.

During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye.

The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for a systemic cause of his glaucoma progression. The facial edema, erythema, and sinus congestion suggest an underlying inflammatory condition, such as sarcoidosis or Wegener's granulomatosis. These conditions can cause inflammation of the optic nerve and lead to glaucoma.

It is important to perform a systemic workup, including chest imaging, to rule out a systemic cause of the patient's glaucoma progression. If a systemic cause is found, it can be treated to improve the patient's glaucoma control.

Title: Acute Unilateral Proptosis After Blunt Orbital Trauma in an Adolescent Patient Case is: A 16-year-old male patient developed acute-onset right-sided periorbital swelling several days after being hit in that area by a snowball. The swelling worsened over the following 3 weeks despite use of warm compresses and a course of doxycycline prescribed by his outside eye care professionals. He had progressive binocular diplopia and right periorbital pain, swelling, and redness. Blurriness of the right eye that started the week before presentation eventually caused enough concern that the patient presented to his local emergency department where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed an intraconal mass (Figure, A). He then came to our institution’s emergency department for urgent ophthalmology consultation.A, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) axial T1 orbit fat-suppressed postcontrast image shows a right retro-orbital intraconal lesion (asterisk) with intrinsic T1 hyperintensity but without fat saturation or enhancement. The lesion causes proptosis (difference between the dotted lines) and posterior globe flattening (white arrowheads). B, B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye shows a well-circumscribed and homogenous lesion with low internal reflectivity (asterisk) sitting directly behind the globe (left). There is a possible thin septation (white arrowheads).His examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, intraocular pressures of 24 mm Hg and 17 mm Hg in the right and left eyes, respectively, and a normal pupil examination without a relative afferent pupillary defect. His right eye had 5-mm relative proptosis, hyperglobus, supraduction deficit, conjunctival injection, grade IV optic disc edema, and choroidal folds. An ultrasonography examination revealed a 2.0 × 2.5-cm echolucent avascular lesion (Figure, B). MRI of the orbits was reviewed by the on-call pediatric radiologist whose leading diagnosis was dermoid/epidermoid cyst.Admit to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibioticsOrder a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid testPerform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **D. Perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy.**

Reasoning:

The patient has a right retro-orbital intraconal lesion that is causing proptosis, hyperglobus, supraduction deficit, conjunctival injection, grade IV optic disc edema, and choroidal folds. These findings are concerning for a mass lesion that is compressing the optic nerve and the globe. The most likely diagnosis is a dermoid/epidermoid cyst. These cysts are typically benign, but they can cause significant visual loss if they are not treated.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy. This will allow for definitive diagnosis of the lesion and removal of any mass that is compressing the optic nerve and the globe.

A course of intravenous antibiotics is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of infection. Ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test is also not necessary, as these tests are used to diagnose pheochromocytoma, which is a rare tumor that is not likely in this patient. Starting high-dose steroids is also not necessary, as this will not improve the patient's visual acuity or relieve the pressure on the optic nerve.

Title: Cervical Lymphadenopathy and Airway Masses in a Child Case is: A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of nasal obstruction, progressive dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck with contrast at his initial hospital admission was concerning for suppurative lymphadenitis. Despite incision and drainage, and intravenous ampicillin and sulbactam, his cervical lymphadenopathy persisted. Results of subsequent workup—including Haemophilus, tetanus, and pneumococcal antibody titers; QuantiFERON-TB Gold test; serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels; absolute lymphocyte count; neutrophil phenotype and function; angiotensin-converting enzyme level; HLA-B27 test; and antinuclear antibody level—were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with gadolinium contrast demonstrated bilateral, bulky, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, as well as enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle (2.3 × 1.6 × 1.2 cm), right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall (0.6 × 0.4 cm). Findings from nasal endoscopy, awake flexible laryngoscopy, and operative microlaryngoscopy revealed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, as well as left vocal cord paresis (Figure, A). Biopsies were taken of the tracheal, laryngeal, and nasal cavity masses, and an excisional biopsy was taken of a left cervical lymph node (Figure, B). Histopathologic examination revealed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining in these cells was positive for S100 and negative for CD1a.A, Awake flexible laryngoscopy showing a yellow mucosal mass in the left laryngeal ventricle.

Based on the patient's history and presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Rosai-Dorfman disease. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of benign-appearing histiocytes with emperipolesis, a characteristic finding in which histiocytes contain intact lymphocytes within their cytoplasm. Rosai-Dorfman disease is typically multifocal, involving the lymph nodes, skin, bone, and other organs. The disease is usually self-limited and resolves spontaneously, but in some cases it can be progressive and life-threatening.

The differential diagnosis for Rosai-Dorfman disease includes other histiocytic disorders, such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and juvenile xanthogranuloma. However, the characteristic histopathologic findings of Rosai-Dorfman disease, including emperipolesis, are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 19-year-old male with a 3-month history of painful lesions on the tongue. He has no other significant medical history. He denies any enlarged lymph nodes, fevers, fatigue, rash, weight loss, or abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms. He reports mild alcohol consumption, denies any cigarette or illicit substance use, and endorses engaging in oral and anal intercourse.

On physical examination, the patient has bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue; it is larger on the right side than the left and has a slightly hairy appearance. The lesion is tender to touch and could not be scraped off. The lips and oral mucosa are without lesions, masses, or ulcers. The patient has no cervical lymphadenopathy. The findings of the physical examination are otherwise unremarkable.

A biopsy procedure of the right oral tongue lesion was performed, and hematoxylin-eosin staining of the specimen revealed dense perivascular plasmacytic infiltration and neutrophilic inflammation.

Based on the history, physical examination, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is oral hairy leukoplakia. Oral hairy leukoplakia is a white, raised lesion that occurs on the tongue or other areas of the oral mucosa. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a common virus that most people are infected with by the time they reach adulthood. Oral hairy leukoplakia is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS.

The treatment for oral hairy leukoplakia is not always necessary. If the lesion is small and not causing any symptoms, it may be monitored without treatment. If the lesion is large or causing symptoms, it can be treated with topical or oral antiviral medications.

Answer: A. Oral hairy leukoplakia

Title: Seeing Blue Dots After COVID-19 Infection Case is: A healthy 12-year-old female individual received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and reported visual symptoms 2 days later, with bilateral blurry vision, large blue paracentral scotomata, and a migraine without a scintillating scotoma. On clinical examination, visual acuity measured 20/70 + 1 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye, while she previously had visual acuity of 20/25 in each eye on examination 8 years prior. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination results were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes. The optic discs, vessels, and periphery were normal. Near-infrared (IR) imaging highlighted the irregularities in both eyes (Figure 1).Near-infrared imaging of the right eye (A) and left eye (B) demonstrates juxtafoveal irregularity. The foveal regions have subtle juxtafoveal geographic areas (white arrowheads), mostly nasal to the foveal center in both eyes (A > B).What Would You Do Next? A: Genetic testing , B: Electroretinogram , C: Optical coherence tomography , D: Fluorescein angiography. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)

Dilated fundus examination revealed subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes. The optic discs, vessels, and periphery were normal. Near-infrared (IR) imaging highlighted the irregularities in both eyes.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of post-COVID-19 retinopathy. Post-COVID-19 retinopathy is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19 infection that can cause permanent vision loss. The exact mechanism of post-COVID-19 retinopathy is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by inflammation and damage to the retinal blood vessels.

The first-line treatment for post-COVID-19 retinopathy is optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to visualize the retina and identify areas of damage. OCT can be used to monitor the progression of post-COVID-19 retinopathy and to assess the response to treatment.

If OCT shows evidence of significant damage to the retina, then other treatments may be necessary, such as laser therapy or anti-inflammatory medication. Laser therapy can be used to seal off leaking blood vessels and to prevent further damage to the retina. Anti-inflammatory medication can be used to reduce inflammation and to protect the retina from further damage.

The prognosis for patients with post-COVID-19 retinopathy varies depending on the severity of the damage. In some cases, vision loss may be permanent. However, in many cases, vision loss can be stabilized or even improved with treatment.

Title: Progressive Hair Loss With Short Hair in a Child Case is: A school-aged girl presented to the dermatology clinic with a 6-year history of hair loss and short hair. Her scalp hair was relatively normal in terms of density and length at birth. Since the age of 1 year, the girl had begun to have frequent hair loss without pulling. Her mother also found that her hair grew to approximately the same maximum length down to the upper neck without trimming. On clinical examination, diffuse, short, sparse, lanugolike, black hair over the scalp was found (Figure, A and B). The surface of the scalp was smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. No involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair was found. Her intellectual performance was normal at presentation and no developmental delay had ever been noted. She denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. Family history regarding hair loss was unremarkable.A and B, Diffuse, sparse, and abnormally short hair over the entire scalp is shown.

A: Short anagen syndrome , B: Loose anagen syndrome , C: Trichodental dysplasia , D: Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The girl's hair loss is diffuse, sparse, and abnormally short. The surface of the scalp is smooth without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. No involvement of eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair is found. Her intellectual performance is normal at presentation and no developmental delay had ever been noted. She denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. Family history regarding hair loss is unremarkable. The hair pull test was positive with predominately anagen hair extracted. Light microscopy of scalp hair shafts revealed no structural abnormalities, such as cuticular damage, twisting, bending, or miniaturization. Blood levels of ferritin, zinc, and hemoglobin are normal. A punch biopsy from the alopecic area of the scalp shows a mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and increased telogen hair with decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of short anagen syndrome (SAS). SAS is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by diffuse, permanent hair loss that begins in childhood. The hair loss is caused by a shortening of the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle. This results in small, thin hairs that do not grow to their full length. SAS is typically diagnosed in children who are 2-5 years old. There is no cure for SAS, but treatment can help to slow the progression of hair loss and improve the appearance of the hair.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a middle-aged woman with a 3-month history of rapidly spreading, intensely pruritic papules on her extremities. The lesions are scattered, erythematous, and annular, measuring up to 5 mm wide. There are also a few asymptomatic brown flat papules scattered on her face. The patient has no remarkable medical or family history and is not concurrently being treated with any medications. She has been previously diagnosed with eczema and treated with topical steroid ointments and oral compound glycyrrhizin tablets, which had no obvious effect. Laboratory investigations, including routine blood, liver and kidney function, antistreptolysin O, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor tests, disclosed no abnormal findings. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic examination.

The most likely diagnosis is annular lichen planus. Annular lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by the development of flat-topped, violaceous papules that often form annular or polycyclic lesions. The lesions are typically pruritic and may be associated with burning or stinging sensations. Lichen planus can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the extremities, particularly the wrists and hands. The cause of lichen planus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no cure for lichen planus, but the symptoms can be treated with topical steroids or oral medications.

The differential diagnosis for annular lichen planus includes a number of other conditions, such as perforating granuloma annulare, eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis, and atypical pityriasis rosea. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of annular lichen planus.

Title: Primary Prevention Management of Elevated Lipoprotein(a) Case is: A South Asian male individual in his early 40s with a strong family history (FHx) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including premature cardiovascular events in multiple family members presented to establish care for cardiovascular risk stratification. He had no traditional risk factors for ASCVD and no cardiac symptoms or limitations. He had never smoked, was physically active, and did not take any medications. His 10-year ASCVD risk was estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, he had 2 risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. His father had a myocardial infarction at age 39 years, and, importantly, his older brother had angioplasty with multiple stents at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on his father’s side had coronary artery disease, the details of which were unspecified.Owing to his striking FHx of premature ASCVD, he underwent screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and obtained a coronary calcium score. His Lp(a) level was elevated at 136 nmol/L and his coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units was notable and placed him in the 94th percentile for his age (Figure 1). He returned to the office for further counseling on what to do next about these findings.Coronary computed tomography calcium scan showing calcified plaque in the left anterior descending artery territory.Counsel on lifestyle modifications and initiate cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a)Start high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, dailyAddress all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiate cascade screening and high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, dailyStart PCSK9 inhibitor therapy such as evolocumab or alirocumab to lower Lp(a) levelWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: This patient has a strong family history of premature ASCVD, including a myocardial infarction in his father at age 39 years and angioplasty with multiple stents in his older brother at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on his father’s side have coronary artery disease. The patient himself has no traditional risk factors for ASCVD, but he does have two risk-enhancing factors: South Asian ancestry and a FHx of premature ASCVD. His 10-year ASCVD risk is estimated at 1.6% (low risk) based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs); however, his Lp(a) level is elevated at 136 nmol/L and his coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units is notable and placed him in the 94th percentile for his age.

Given the patient’s strong family history of premature ASCVD and his elevated Lp(a) level, I would recommend starting high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily. I would also counsel the patient on lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation, weight loss, and exercise, to further reduce his risk of ASCVD. Additionally, I would recommend cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a).

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety who presents with progressive imbalance while walking and intense fear of falling for the past 14 years. She has become progressively disabled and has been using a wheelchair for 4 years prior to presentation. Her neurological examination shows gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus in both directions along with slow saccades and gaze restriction in both vertical and horizontal planes. There is ataxic dysarthria. Tone is normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes are absent and plantar fascia are mute. Limb power is normal. Ataxia is seen on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests. Chorea is present in both legs. Ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes is noted. Electromyography reveals sensory neuronopathy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse cerebellar atrophy is noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus. Psychiatric treatment was commenced for her severe anxiety but did not relieve the fear of falling.

The most likely diagnosis is Friedreich ataxia (FA). FA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, spasticity, and sensory loss. The diagnosis is usually made in childhood or adolescence, but it can present in adults. There is no cure for FA, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms.

The other possible diagnoses are Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), and mitochondrial ataxia. FXTAS is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. It is characterized by progressive ataxia, tremor, and cognitive impairment. NPC is a rare, fatal, lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the NPC1 gene. It is characterized by progressive ataxia, seizures, and hepatosplenomegaly. Mitochondrial ataxia is a group of disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by progressive ataxia, weakness, and vision loss.

In this case, the patient's age, history, and clinical presentation are most consistent with FA. The MRI findings of diffuse cerebellar atrophy and T2 hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus are also consistent with FA. The patient's psychiatric treatment for her severe anxiety did not relieve her fear of falling, which is a common symptom of FA.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Friedreich ataxia.

Title: Abdominal Pain in a 15-Year-Old Adolescent Girl Case is: A 15-year-old adolescent girl who was taking an oral contraceptive presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain that had developed gradually over a 3-day period. She had no associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, bloating, or anorexia. She reported no precipitating factors for the pain and had no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or abdominal trauma. Over the previous 2 years, the patient had experienced similar intermittent episodes of abdominal pain lasting approximately 1 week. Results from laboratory tests, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and an abdominal computed tomography scan performed 1 year prior to presentation were normal.In the emergency department, her vital signs were normal and her body mass index was 20.4 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Abdominal examination revealed no rigidity or guarding; however, a 1-cm point of maximal tenderness was identified in the left lower abdominal quadrant (Figure). During palpation of this 1-cm area, the pain increased when she lifted her head and tensed her abdominal muscles. She experienced cold hypoesthesia when an alcohol gauze pad was applied to this area and severe pain when the skin was pinched.Point of maximal tenderness (black “X”), confined to an area no larger than a fingertip on the left side of the abdomen.Inject a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tendernessWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This can cause pain, infertility, and other problems.

A local anesthetic injection into the area of maximal tenderness is a diagnostic test that can be used to confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis. The injection of the local anesthetic will block the pain receptors in the area, and if the pain resolves, it is a strong indication that the patient has endometriosis.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 6-year-old boy with a history of fever, cough, and vesiculobullous skin lesions. The physical examination reveals bilateral exudative conjunctivitis, white exudates on the tongue, posterior pharynx, and buccal mucosa, erosions with overlying dried blood around the eyes, lips, and anal mucosa, targetoid erythematous papules on the face, and vesiculobullous lesions on the torso and extremities. Laboratory testing shows a white blood cell count of 15,000/μL (82% neutrophils), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 39 mm/h, and C-reactive protein level of 57.1 mg/L. A computed tomography scan of the chest reveals bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Azithromycin (10 mg/kg daily, intravenously) was started.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Mycoplasma pneumonia: This is a common respiratory infection that can cause fever, cough, and pneumonia. The white blood cell count is typically normal or elevated with a left shift. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are usually elevated. Chest X-ray findings can be normal or show diffuse interstitial infiltrates.
* Kawasaki disease: This is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, heart, and other organs. The classic presentation includes fever, rash, conjunctivitis, oral lesions, lymphadenopathy, and changes in the extremities. The white blood cell count is typically elevated with a left shift. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are usually elevated. Echocardiogram findings can show coronary artery aneurysms.
* Behçet disease: This is a chronic, relapsing, multisystem inflammatory disorder that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, eyes, joints, and other organs. The classic presentation includes recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. The white blood cell count is typically normal or elevated. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are usually elevated. Pathergy test is positive in about 80% of patients with Behçet disease.
* Monkeypox: This is a rare viral zoonosis that can cause fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to other parts of the body. The rash can be vesicular, pustular, or both. The white blood cell count is typically normal or slightly elevated. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are usually normal. Monkeypox virus can be detected in the blood, skin lesions, or oropharyngeal swabs.

In this case, the most likely diagnosis is Mycoplasma pneumonia. The patient has a history of fever, cough, and pneumonia. The physical examination reveals bilateral exudative conjunctivitis, white exudates on the tongue, posterior pharynx, and buccal mucosa, erosions with overlying dried blood around the eyes, lips, and anal mucosa, targetoid erythematous papules on the face, and vesiculobullous lesions on the torso and extremities. Laboratory testing shows a white blood cell count of 15,000/μL (82% neutrophils), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 39 mm/h, and C-reactive protein level of 57.1 mg/L. A computed tomography scan of the chest reveals bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.

The next step in management is to obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels. These levels can help to confirm the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia. If the patient is found to have Mycoplasma pneumonia, he can be treated with azithromycin or clarithromycin.

The patient in this case is a 62-year-old woman with a history of kidney failure due to IgA nephropathy who is undergoing peritoneal dialysis. She presents with a 1-day history of severe abdominal pain and cloudy PD fluid. Seven days prior, she inadvertently broke aseptic technique when tightening a leaking connection of her PD catheter tubing. On presentation, she is afebrile and has normal vital signs. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness. Cloudy fluid that was drained from her PD catheter was sent for laboratory analysis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to administer empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics. This is because the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of peritonitis, which is a serious infection of the peritoneal cavity. Peritonitis can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics will cover a wide range of potential pathogens and help to prevent the spread of infection.

Intravenous antibiotics may also be necessary in some cases. However, intraperitoneal antibiotics are the preferred treatment for peritonitis in patients who are undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This is because intraperitoneal antibiotics have better access to the peritoneal cavity and are less likely to cause systemic side effects.

Blood cultures should also be sent to identify the specific organism causing the infection. This information will be helpful in selecting the most appropriate antibiotics for treatment.

In conclusion, the next step in the management of this patient is to administer empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics. Intravenous antibiotics may also be necessary in some cases. Blood cultures should also be sent to identify the specific organism causing the infection.

Title: Delayed-Onset Bilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis Following Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion Surgery Case is: A 68-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and obesity had undergone C5 anterior corpectomy and fusion (C4-6) with expandable cage, autograft, and anterior instrumentation and posterior spinal decompression and fusion (C4-7) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Five months after surgery, he presented to the otolaryngology clinic with 3 weeks of mild odynophagia and dysphagia. It was noted that the patient had a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform (Video 1). During the next 6 months, he gradually developed shortness of breath and stridor, and eventually presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress requiring intubation for 2 days. Shortly after extubation, laryngeal examination showed fullness of the posterior pharyngeal wall and severely limited vocal fold abduction bilaterally (Figure 1A; Video 1). A modified barium swallow study showed intermittent laryngeal penetration without aspiration (Video 2). Although the patient was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging, a soft tissue computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed a well-positioned plate with no evidence of fluid collection in the setting of a normal leukocyte count. One month later, a neuromuscular specialist investigated potential underlying neurological causes; however, results of nerve conduction, antiacetylcholine receptor, antimuscle-specific kinase, methylmalonic acid, HIV, rapid plasma reagin, vitamin B-12, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, copper, creatine kinase, and immunofixation studies were all unremarkable.Maximum abduction of vocal folds on laryngoscopic examination 11 months after placement of anterior cervical spinal plate (A) and 2 months after removal (B)What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Arnold-Chiari malformation , B: Spinal abscess causing laryngeal edema , C: Idiopathic bilateral vocal fold paralysis , D: Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis. He underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery 5 months prior to presentation with symptoms of odynophagia, dysphagia, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are consistent with vocal fold paralysis, which can be caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The recurrent laryngeal nerves are responsible for innervating the vocal folds, and damage to these nerves can result in paralysis of the vocal folds. In this case, the patient's vocal fold paralysis is likely due to damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves during the anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.

Answer:
D. Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis.

Title: A Pigmented Iris Lesion Case is: A patient in their mid-60s was referred for evaluation of a left iris pigmented lesion. The mass had been present for decades and multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists, most recently 4 years prior, showed the mass remained stable in size.The patient’s ocular history included cataract extraction with intraocular lens placement and retinal tear of the right eye and cataract of the left eye. Review of systems was negative for any recent changes in health, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/25+ OS. Intraocular pressures were normal.Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, and the left eye had a raised pigmented iris lesion without prominent internal vasculature and with mammillations on the surface (multiple small smooth dome-shaped protuberances on the surface of the tumor). There were large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and on the adjacent iris surrounding the mass (Figure 1A). There was no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. There were mild nuclear sclerotic changes across the lens in the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor with a height of 1.4 mm and basal diameter of 4.1 mm, without angle or ciliary body involvement (Figure 1B).Color slitlamp photograph shows a pigmented iris mass (note both the mammillations [black arrowheads] as well as the pigment granules stuck on the tumor surface [white arrowheads]) (A); ultrasound biomicroscopy shows solid, echogenically homogeneous iris stromal tumor with high internal reflectivity (B).What Would You Do Next? A: Observation , B: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy , C: Plaque brachytherapy , D: Iridectomy for excision of the lesion. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case has a pigmented iris lesion that has been present for decades and has shown no change in size over the past 4 years. The lesion is non-vascular and has no ectropion uvea or iris neovascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy shows that the lesion is a homogeneous intrinsic iris solid tumor without angle or ciliary body involvement. These findings are consistent with a benign nevus.

Given the patient's age, the history of the lesion, and the benign appearance on imaging, observation is the most appropriate management at this time. The patient should be followed closely with annual eye exams to monitor for any changes in the lesion. If the lesion does change in size or appearance, then further management, such as a biopsy or excision, may be necessary.

Title: Generalized Cutaneous Nodules on the Trunk and Extremities Case is: A 61-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. He denied systemic complaints such as weakness, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Oral glucocorticoids did not show any therapeutic effect. His medical history was remarkable for mild anemia because of untreated hemorrhoids. Physical examination revealed numerous symmetrically distributed, well-defined, erythematous skin nodules on his back, buttocks, and limb extensors (Figure, A). Prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes were noted, with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 5 × 2 cm. Laboratory tests were significant for atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (count up to 6%), an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio (9.21; normal range, 0.7-3.1), moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.7 g/dL; normal range, 11.5-15.0 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35 mm/h; normal range, 0-25 mm/h), and cryoglobulins composed of mixed polyclonal immunoglobulins.

A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule was sent for histopathologic examination.

The histopathologic findings showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes with proliferation of high endothelial venules. In situ hybridization was positive for EBV in the skin.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects middle-aged and older adults. It is characterized by a widespread, multisystem inflammatory disorder with a predilection for the lungs, skin, and central nervous system. The disease is often fatal, with a median survival of only 2-3 years.

The treatment of lymphomatoid granulomatosis is challenging and there is no standard approach. Treatment options include corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The choice of treatment depends on the extent of disease, the patient's age and overall health, and the response to previous therapy.

He reported occasional alcohol intake, and there was no history of tobacco-related habits or oral trauma. The results of laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count, serum chemistry panel, liver and kidney function test, C-reactive protein levels, lipid profile, and serum and urine electrophoresis disclosed no abnormalities. With the clinical suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma, an incisional biopsy was performed. The histopathologic findings show circumscribed eosinophilic, amorphous fissured masses in the subepithelial connective tissue.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes verrucous xanthoma, colloid milium–classic adult type, nodular amyloidosis, and nodular colloid degeneration.

Verrucous xanthoma is a rare, benign, inflammatory skin lesion that is characterized by verrucous papules or plaques. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly men, and is associated with hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and liver disease. The lesions are typically located on the extremities, but can also be seen on the trunk and face. Histologically, verrucous xanthoma is characterized by a proliferation of foamy macrophages in the papillary dermis.

Colloid milium–classic adult type is a rare, benign, developmental anomaly of the skin that is characterized by multiple, small, white papules. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women, and is associated with chronic sun exposure. The lesions are typically located on the face, neck, and upper trunk. Histologically, colloid milium is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophilic, amorphous material in the dermis.

Nodular amyloidosis is a rare, systemic, amyloidosis that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the skin, kidneys, heart, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly men, and is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. The lesions are typically located on the extremities, but can also be seen on the trunk and face. Histologically, nodular amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the dermis and subcutis.

Nodular colloid degeneration is a rare, benign, degenerative condition of the skin that is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophilic, amorphous material in the dermis. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women, and is associated with chronic sun exposure. The lesions are typically located on the face, neck, and upper trunk. Histologically, nodular colloid degeneration is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophilic, amorphous material in the dermis.

In this patient, the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of verrucous xanthoma. The lesions are located on the tongue, which is a common site for verrucous xanthoma. The histopathologic findings show a proliferation of foamy macrophages in the papillary dermis, which is a characteristic finding of verrucous xanthoma.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 70s who presents with a 6-month history of a rash on the left forearm, which gradually increased in severity. The rash started on the dorsal aspect of his hand and spread to the forearm. The lesions are large, firm, mildly swollen, erythematous plaques with purulent discharge and crusting. There is no history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens. The patient denied any systemic symptoms and concerns. Physical examination revealed large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques on the back of the left forearm with purulent discharge and crusting. Results of routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and chest radiography, were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination. The histopathology showed hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and a small amount of multinucleated giant cells in the dermis. Periodic acid–Schiff staining showed the presence of fungal elements. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of fungal hyphae.

The most likely diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis. Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic, granulomatous fungal infection that is caused by dematiaceous fungi. The most common species involved are Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, and Cladosporium carrionii. The disease is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, but it can also occur in temperate areas. The infection is acquired through traumatic inoculation of the skin with contaminated soil or wood. The lesions are typically solitary, but they can be multiple. They are often located on exposed areas of the skin, such as the hands, feet, and arms. The lesions are initially papular or nodular, and they may ulcerate. They are often hyperpigmented and have a verrucous or papillomatous appearance. The diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis is made based on the clinical presentation, the histopathology, and the culture of the organism. The treatment of chromoblastomycosis is challenging. The drugs that are most effective are amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole. The treatment may be prolonged, and relapses are common.

Title: A Recurrent Orbital Hemorrhage in an Older Adult Case is: A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with a unilateral painless right proptosis, first noticed 3 days prior. There was no contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery. Visual acuity (VA) was 20/32 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior-segment and fundus examination results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a right retro-orbital hemorrhage. No etiology could be identified on the image. Systemic corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg per day) was prescribed for 48 hours. The proptosis decreased, and the patient was discharged.After 6 months, complete ophthalmologic examination was performed again; VA was 20/20 OU, and there was no remaining proptosis. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED for another episode of acute, painless, right proptosis, and the VA had decreased to 20/40 OD. MRI showed a right retrobulbar hemorrhage. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was again prescribed for 48 hours with rapid resolution of the visual impairment but incomplete resolution of the proptosis.One month later, the patient presented to our ophthalmology department. The VA was 20/20 OU, with a persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze.

Title: Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma With Orbital Extension Case is: A 72-year-old homeless man was referred for management of a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. On review of history, maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast done 5 months prior to presentation showed a 5.9 × 5.3 × 3.7-cm mass centered at the right temple that tracked along the right lateral orbital wall as well as an enhancing right intraparotid lymph node. The patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 5 months later with an enlarged crusting and ulcerating lesion of the right temple/brow (Figure 1A). On ocular examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/125 OS due to cataracts, pupils reacted normally without afferent pupillary defect, and ocular motility was full. He had mild proptosis in the right eye and right lower eyelid retraction. Orbicularis strength was intact and symmetric in both eyes. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck with and without contrast showed a 6.1 × 5.7 × 4.0-cm mass with erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus (Figure 1B).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow with orbital extension. He is strongly against an orbital exenteration. The best option for treatment is neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass.

Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody) is a promising new treatment for locally advanced or metastatic SCC. It works by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, which allows the body's immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. In clinical trials, neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy has been shown to improve survival and response rates in patients with SCC.

Globe sparing orbitotomy is a surgical procedure that can be used to remove a tumor from the orbit while preserving the eye. This procedure is often used in patients with SCC of the orbit because it allows for a more complete resection of the tumor while minimizing the risk of damage to the eye.

Surgical excision of the mass is the final step in the treatment of this patient. This procedure will remove any remaining tumor cells that were not killed by the neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy.

On examination, the patient has a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS, unremarkable anterior segment findings, and intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OU. A fundus examination in the right eye reveals scarce pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation in the inferior temporal arcade corresponding to the CNV. Optical coherence tomography imaging reveals a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, compatible with the described epiretinal membrane.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented epiretinal membrane includes:

* Epiretinal membrane
* Choroidal neovascularization
* Macular degeneration
* Central serous chorioretinopathy
* Retinal detachment

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a pigmented epiretinal membrane. This is supported by the patient's history of cataract surgery in the right eye, followed by an asymptomatic vision loss that was attributed to the presence of CNV. The CNV was treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, but the patient's vision did not improve. The fundus examination reveals a dark-pigmented epiretinal membrane, which is consistent with a pigmented epiretinal membrane. The optical coherence tomography imaging reveals a hyperreflective structure on the surface of the inner retina with increased macular thickness, which is also consistent with a pigmented epiretinal membrane.

The treatment for a pigmented epiretinal membrane is typically observation. However, if the patient experiences significant vision loss, surgery may be considered. The goal of surgery is to remove the epiretinal membrane and improve the patient's vision.

In this case, the patient's vision is not significantly impaired. Therefore, I would recommend close observation. I would also recommend that the patient see an ophthalmologist for regular follow-up exams.

Title: Subacute Abdominal Pain in a Patient With Chronic Liver Disease and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Case is: A 66-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with subacute epigastric pain. Three years prior, she was diagnosed with a solitary HCC and underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated HCC, 16 cm in largest dimension, with large vein involvement (T3bNXM0, R0 resection). The patient underwent expectant observation. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, laboratory results revealed an elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP), and cross-sectional imaging revealed multiple lung nodules consistent with metastases. She was treated with nivolumab every other week and attained a biochemical (baseline, 212.2 ng/dL; best response, 3.3 ng/dL) and radiographic complete response.In the current presentation, the patient reported nonradiating epigastric pain of moderate intensity for 1 month. Associated symptoms included nausea, anorexia, and water brash without emesis.

Title: Patient With Hearing Loss and a Middle Ear Mass Case is: A 65-year-old patient was referred to the ear, nose, and throat department with left-sided hearing loss during the past 6 months without evident cause. He had a medical history of myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, Ménière disease, and congenital cataract. Furthermore, he did not report otalgia, otorrhea, a recent episode of Ménière disease, or other ear, nose, and throat or systemic symptoms. The patient used atorvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid, did not smoke, and reported drinking 2 glasses of wine daily. Otoscopy of the left ear revealed a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. The lesion was hard and painful during palpation (Figure 1A). Otoscopy results for the right side were normal.Conductive hearing loss of the left ear because of a middle ear mass, seen on otoscopy (A) and on computed tomography (CT) (B).Pure-tone audiometry results showed a left-sided mixed hearing loss with a pure tone average of 110 dB HL and bone conduction levels at approximately 60 dB HL. The tympanogram showed a normal A-type curve with a normal to low middle ear compliance of 0.5 mm on the left side. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the middle ear showed a heterogeneous hyperdense round mass of 5.5 mm in the left middle ear with a close relation to the malleus, eardrum, and tegmen (Figure 1B).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, Ménière disease, and congenital cataract. He presents with left-sided hearing loss for the past 6 months without evident cause. Otoscopy reveals a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. The lesion is hard and painful during palpation. Pure-tone audiometry results show a left-sided mixed hearing loss with a pure tone average of 110 dB HL and bone conduction levels at approximately 60 dB HL.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the middle ear shows a heterogeneous hyperdense round mass of 5.5 mm in the left middle ear with a close relation to the malleus, eardrum, and tegmen. There were no other abnormalities in the mastoid, ossicular chain, facial nerve canal, or surrounding blood vessels.

The most likely diagnosis is cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is a benign, but locally aggressive, epithelial tumor that arises from the ectodermal lining of the middle ear. It is thought to develop as a result of eustachian tube dysfunction, which leads to negative pressure in the middle ear and subsequent retraction of the tympanic membrane. This retraction can create a space in the middle ear that is lined with ectodermal cells, which can then proliferate and form a cholesteatoma.

The classic presentation of cholesteatoma is with conductive hearing loss, otalgia, and otorrhea. However, up to one-third of patients with cholesteatoma may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis is made on otoscopy, which reveals a white, pearly mass in the middle ear. CT imaging can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the disease.

The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgical removal. The goal of surgery is to remove the entire cholesteatoma and to prevent recurrence. This may be accomplished with a simple mastoidectomy or with a more extensive procedure, such as a canal wall up or down mastoidectomy.

Answer: A. Cholesteatoma

Title: Pediatric Cystic Deep Neck Mass Presenting With Stridor and Dysphagia Case is: A 6-month-old girl presented to the emergency department for evaluation of fever and was noted to have mild inspiratory stridor. Her parents stated that her stridor began acutely at 4 months of age without any inciting illness or event. The stridor was worse with agitation but was without positional exacerbation. The family reported that the stridor had remained stable since onset. Her parents noted mild dysphagia but denied shortness of breath, cyanosis, or apnea. Laboratory test results revealed acute COVID-19 infection. Physical examination was unremarkable other than mild inspiratory stridor. Findings from bedside flexible laryngoscopy revealed intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence. No supraglottic or glottic masses were identified. Anterior-posterior neck and chest radiography demonstrated narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet and diffuse patchy heterogenous airspace opacities (Figure, A). Subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan demonstrated a 3.2 × 2.0-cm low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx (Figure, B-D). Operative laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is a foregut duplication cyst. Foregut duplication cysts are congenital anomalies that arise from abnormal embryologic development of the foregut. They are most commonly located in the neck, but can also occur in the abdomen or chest. Foregut duplication cysts are lined with epithelium and may contain fluid, mucus, or air. They can be asymptomatic or may present with symptoms related to compression of adjacent structures, such as stridor, dysphagia, or recurrent respiratory infections. The diagnosis of a foregut duplication cyst is made with imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.

Title: Postauricular Cyst in a 15-Year-Old Girl Case is: A 15-year-old girl presented to the otorhinolaryngologic department for a right-side postauricular mass. The mass had been present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. There were no fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal (EAC), and there were no additional cysts, sinuses, or fistulas at the right neck from the hyoid bone and chin to the EAC. On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (Figure, A-D). In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris (Figure, E). There was no recurrence 6 months after surgery.A-D, Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, oval cystic mass at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images (in order from the left).

Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is an epidermoid cyst. This is a benign, slow-growing, keratin-containing cyst that arises from the epidermis. It is the most common type of cyst in the head and neck region. Epidermoid cysts are typically located in the skin, but they can also occur in the subcutaneous tissue, muscles, or bones. They are usually round or oval, and they can range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. The cyst wall is composed of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, and the cyst contents are typically keratinous debris. Epidermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic, but they can become infected or inflamed. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Title: A Swollen Supraglottis Case is: A 28-year-old White woman with no remarkable medical history presented with difficulty phonating and singing for the past 15 months. She also reported odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids. The patient had been treated previously with steroids and amoxicillin for the presumptive diagnosis of chronic laryngitis but reported no improvement in symptoms. Laboratory workup was positive for elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and was consequently referred to our institution.On presentation, the patient had only minimal dysphonia. She underwent a transnasal flexible laryngoscopy that demonstrated a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids (Figure, A). The vocal folds were difficult to visualize but seemed normal in appearance and mobility. Stroboscopy could not be performed because of obstruction from the prolapsing arytenoids. Interestingly, the patient denied any shortness of breath. Results of laboratory testing revealed normal levels of all components of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The patient’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated to 75 mm/h (reference range, 0-15 mm/h). Findings of chest radiography were normal. An esophagram showed no evidence of reflux esophagitis and a computed tomography of the neck showed edema of the supraglottis with some edema in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall.A, Awake flexible laryngoscopy image of the edematous epiglottis, arytenoids, and posterior pharyngeal wall. B, High-magnification of hematoxylin-eosin staining reveals well-formed noncaseating granulomas (arrowheads) with lymphoid reaction visible around the granulomas.Subsequently, the patient underwent a direct laryngoscopy with laryngeal biopsy. Pathology results demonstrated hyperplastic squamous mucosa with submucosal chronic inflammation and fibrosis and were negative for high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma; scattered nonnecrotizing granulomas in the subepithelium were also observed (Figure, B).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Laryngopharyngeal reflux , B: Laryngeal sarcoidosis , C: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis , D: Laryngeal tuberculosis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is most consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. This is a multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in multiple organs. The most common sites of involvement are the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. Laryngeal involvement is seen in about 5% of patients with sarcoidosis.

The patient's symptoms of difficulty phonating and singing, odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids are all consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. The findings on flexible laryngoscopy of a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids are also consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. The elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are non-specific findings that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including sarcoidosis. The normal chest radiography, esophagram, and computed tomography of the neck do not provide evidence of other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, laryngeal cancer, or tuberculosis.

The pathology results of hyperplastic squamous mucosa with submucosal chronic inflammation and fibrosis, scattered nonnecrotizing granulomas in the subepithelium, and negative for high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma are also consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Title: Generalized Nodules in an Older Adult Man Case is: An otherwise healthy man in his 60s presented to our department with an 8-month history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on his extremities and trunk. The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching. Physical examinations revealed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as his medical and family histories were unremarkable. Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative. A biopsy specimen was taken from one of the skin lesions on his right forearm for histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing (Figure, C and D).A and B, Clinical images showed disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the back, waist, and extremities.

Reasoning:
The patient is an otherwise healthy man in his 60s who presented with an 8-month history of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on his extremities and trunk. The patient had been initially diagnosed with nodular prurigo at a local hospital and treated with various topical steroids and oral antihistamines for 2 months, without significant improvement. The skin lesions continued to progress and worsened after scratching.

On physical examination, the patient was found to have disseminated erythematous papules, hypertrophic plaques approximately 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and dome-shaped nodules with excoriated whitish or pink centers on the scalp, chest, abdomen, back, waist, and extremities. Subsequent examinations of the mucosal membranes appeared normal. Other physical examinations as well as his medical and family histories were unremarkable.

Peripheral eosinophils, serum total immunoglobulin E level, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for HIV, and results of other routine laboratory tests were within normal ranges or negative. A biopsy specimen was taken from one of the skin lesions on his right forearm for histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing.

The histopathological examination showed marked hyperkeratosis, acanthosis with irregular elongation of the rete ridges, fibrotic dermis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. The DIF testing revealed linear deposition of immunoglobulin G along the basement membrane zone.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigoid nodularis. Pemphigoid nodularis is a rare autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the formation of subcutaneous nodules that may ulcerate. The disease is most commonly seen in older adults, and women are more commonly affected than men. The exact cause of pemphigoid nodularis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the basement membrane zone, which is the area where the epidermis (top layer of skin) meets the dermis (underlying layer of skin).

The treatment for pemphigoid nodularis is typically with systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone. In some cases, other immunosuppressive medications, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, may also be necessary. The prognosis for pemphigoid nodularis is generally good, with most patients responding well to treatment. However, the disease can be chronic and relapsing.

Title: Numerous Angiomatous Lesions in an Infant Case is: A 3-month-old boy was referred for evaluation of multiple cutaneous red papules. The guardian reported first noticing the papules at birth. During the following months, the papules grew in number and size, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown.Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale (Figure, A and B).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 3-month-old boy with multiple cutaneous red papules. The lesions were first noticed at birth and have since grown in number and size. They are located on the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. Some of the lesions are associated with ulceration and bleeding. The patient was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery; the birth mother had not received prenatal care. Neither the birth mother nor the infant had any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances. The paternal family medical history was unremarkable; maternal family medical history was unknown.

Physical examination revealed numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques ranging in size from 1.0 × 1.0 mm to 2.2 × 2.3 cm, many of which had hemorrhagic crust and dark scale. Additional examination findings included retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia.

A low-power view of histopathology findings demonstrated epidermal hyperplasia and an upper dermal vascular proliferation.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes multifocal infantile hemangioma, bacillary angiomatosis, multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia, and congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma.

Multifocal infantile hemangioma is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors of infancy, occurring in approximately 10% of infants. They are characterized by rapid growth during the first few months of life, followed by spontaneous involution over a period of several years. Multifocal infantile hemangiomas are present in approximately 10% of infants with hemangiomas.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare infection caused by Bartonella henselae. It typically occurs in immunocompromised patients, but can also occur in immunocompetent patients, particularly those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Bacillary angiomatosis is characterized by the development of multiple vascular lesions, which can be papular, nodular, or plaque-like. The lesions are often violaceous or red, and may ulcerate. Bacillary angiomatosis can be associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia is a rare disorder characterized by the development of multiple lymphangiomas and thrombocytopenia. Lymphangiomas are benign tumors of lymphatic vessels. They can be localized or multifocal. Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia is typically seen in children, and is often associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, a life-threatening condition characterized by thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and organomegaly.

Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is a rare disorder characterized by the development of multiple pyogenic granulomas at birth. Pyogenic granulomas are benign tumors of the skin that are characterized by rapid growth and ulceration. Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is typically seen in infants born to mothers with diabetes mellitus.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is multifocal infantile hemangioma. The patient's history, physical examination, and histopathology findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Title: A Conflicting Case of Ophthalmoparesis Case is: A 37-year-old Asian nonsmoking man with no known medical or drug history presented with an insidious onset of left-eye ptosis (only brought to attention by his friends on review of recent photographs) and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year. He did not complain of headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness. There was no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms.Neurological examination revealed a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction (Figure 1) with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor.Top left (looking right and up), middle left (looking right), bottom left (looking right and down), center (primary position), top right (looking left and up), middle right (looking left), and bottom right (looking left and down). The images demonstrate left-eye hypotropia and left-eyelid ptosis at the primary position and impaired left-eye supraduction worse at lateral gaze on extraocular movements.Laboratory evaluation showed a normal fasting serum glucose level, thyroid function test result, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anti–double-stranded DNA, antinuclear antibodies, and HIV test results were negative. Repetitive nerve stimulation did not show any decremental response and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative. A computed tomography (CT) angiography of the circle of Willis did not show any aneurysms and a routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain did not show any infarcts or masses.

Lumbar puncture was acellular with normal glucose and protein levels, and multiple microbiological test results were negative.

The most likely diagnosis is neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve. This is supported by the patient's history of insidious onset of left-eye ptosis and subsequent painless vertical diplopia for 1 year, as well as the findings on neurological examination. The ptosis and hypotropia are likely due to compression of the oculomotor nerve by an adjacent blood vessel, while the nonreactive pupil is likely due to involvement of the sympathetic fibers that supply the pupil. The absence of other cranial nerve deficits and the normal laboratory and imaging studies support the diagnosis of neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve.

Title: A White Retinal Lesion With Calcification in an 11-Year-Old Boy Case is: An 11-year-old boy was referred to assess a retinal mass in the left eye found on his first routine ophthalmic evaluation. He reported no present or past ocular symptoms and had negative findings on a review of systems. His history included full-term birth by cesarean delivery from an uncomplicated pregnancy. He had healthy, nonconsanguineous parents.The ocular examination showed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU with no anterior segment abnormalities. Findings of dilated fundus examination of the right eye were within normal limits. In the left eye, a white, translucent solid lesion with calcification was noticeable in the inferonasal quadrant (Figure, A). The lesion measured approximately 1.6 mm in height, exhibited mild underlying chorioretinal changes, and had associated 3 vitreous seeds (Figure, A). There were no signs of internal vascularization or vitritis. Optical coherence tomography confirmed an intraretinal location and calcified deposits within the lesion (Figure, B).A, Left eye fundus photograph showing the white retinal lesion and vitreous seeds (arrowheads). B, Optical coherence tomography confirming an intraretinal tumor with calcification (asterisks). Scan noise due to the lesion’s peripheral location.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The white retinal lesion with calcification in an 11-year-old boy is most likely a retinal astrocytoma. Retinal astrocytomas are rare, benign tumors of the retina that most often occur in children. They are typically located in the periphery of the retina and are often asymptomatic. However, they can cause vision loss if they grow large enough to obstruct the macula or optic nerve.

The most common treatment for retinal astrocytomas is observation. This is because the tumors are often slow-growing and may not require treatment. However, if the tumor is growing or causing vision loss, it may need to be removed surgically.

In this case, the patient is an 11-year-old boy with a white retinal lesion with calcification in the left eye. The lesion is located in the inferonasal quadrant and measures approximately 1.6 mm in height. There are no signs of internal vascularization or vitritis. Optical coherence tomography confirms an intraretinal location and calcified deposits within the lesion.

Given the patient's age, the location of the lesion, and the absence of other findings, the most likely diagnosis is a retinal astrocytoma. The next step in management is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the orbit to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the tumor. If the tumor is small and asymptomatic, it can be observed closely. However, if the tumor is large or growing, it may need to be removed surgically.

Title: A Young Boy With Changes in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium Case is: A 9-year-old boy was referred to a pediatric retina specialist for evaluation of changes in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium. Ocular history included high hyperopia and amblyopia, and abnormal foveal contour was discovered when he was aged 3 years. Family history was noncontributory. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left. Pupils were round and reactive to light, and intraocular pressure and anterior segment examination were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed blunted foveal reflexes and abnormal vasculature in the inferonasal quadrant of the right eye. Fluorescein angiography displayed symmetric bilateral circular areas of hypofluorescence around the macula and irregular fovea with no leakage (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium in the periphery (Figure 1B). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer.What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 9-year-old boy with changes in the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography on initial examination showed an abnormal foveal contour with loss of the foveal pit and intraretinal cystoid cavities within the inner nuclear layer.

The most likely diagnosis is Best disease, an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium cells. Best disease is caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene, which encodes a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin is essential for the function of the retinal pigment epithelium, which is responsible for maintaining the health of the photoreceptors.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of Best disease. Genetic testing will also help to determine the type of Best disease the patient has, as there are several different subtypes. The subtype of Best disease can affect the rate of progression of the disease and the response to treatment.

Once the diagnosis of Best disease is confirmed, the patient should be monitored regularly for signs of progression of the disease. This includes regular visual acuity testing, fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography. Treatment options for Best disease are limited, but there are a few medications that can help to slow the progression of the disease.

The patient should also be educated about the risks of Best disease, including the potential for blindness. He should be advised to avoid activities that could damage his eyes, such as contact sports and smoking. He should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of retinal detachment, which is a serious complication of Best disease.

Title: Numerous White Retinal Lesions Following Cataract Surgery Case is: A 74-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of retinal lesions in her left eye. Her ocular history was notable for recent cataract surgery 5 weeks prior to presentation that was complicated by endophthalmitis. A normal funduscopic examination was documented prior to cataract surgery. At the time of initial presentation to her local retina specialist 1 week following her cataract surgery, the patient had severe pain and redness. Her visual acuity was light perception. An examination revealed a 2-mm hypopyon and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina. She was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with a vitreous tap and intravitreal injections of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL), ceftazidime (2.2 mg/0.1 mL), and dexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 mL). The vitreous sample obtained at the time of treatment grew Staphylococcus caprae susceptible to vancomycin.At time of examination in our clinic 4 weeks following treatment, the patient was receiving topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. Her best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/70. Examination showed a deep and quiet anterior chamber with a well-positioned intraocular lens without any plaques or deposits on the lens capsule. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated improvement in the vitreous debris with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions (Figure 1B).A, Fundus photograph of the left eye at presentation shows vitreous debris with numerous white lesions throughout the retina.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery, which was treated with intravitreal antibiotics. The patient's visual acuity has improved to 20/70, but there are numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula. These lesions are consistent with retinal infiltrates, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infectious endophthalmitis, non-infectious endophthalmitis, and inflammatory conditions such as posterior uveitis.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's retinal lesions, it is necessary to perform a pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy. This procedure will allow for the removal of vitreous fluid and tissue for culture and pathological examination. The results of these tests will help to determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

Title: A Pruritic Eyelid Lesion Followed by Conjunctival Swelling Case is: An otherwise healthy 54-year-old woman presented with an erythematous right lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, accompanied by pruritus and pain (Figure 1A). The lesion resolved after 1 month, but she developed redness and swelling of the inner part of her right conjunctiva the next day (Figure 1B). She denied any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or diarrhea. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation, where she had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats. She had not traveled to any other countries.Painful and pruritic lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance (arrow) (A). This was followed by an elevation in the bulbar conjunctiva with whitish linear opacities within the lesion (B).Ophthalmological examination showed a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 OU and intraocular pressures of 17 OD and 18 OS. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. On slit-lamp examination of the right eye, there was diffuse conjunctival vasodilation and hyperemia that was worse nasally. There was a cystic elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva nasally with whitish linear opacities within the lesion (Figure 1B). The cornea was clear. There was no anterior chamber or vitreous inflammation.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a history of a pruritic eyelid lesion followed by conjunctival swelling. The lesion resolved after 1 month, but the conjunctival swelling has persisted. The patient has no vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms. The patient has recently immigrated from rural Moldova, where she had exposure to farm animals.

The differential diagnosis for a pruritic eyelid lesion includes viral conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and herpes zoster conjunctivitis. The differential diagnosis for conjunctival swelling includes viral conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and foreign body in the eye.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is viral conjunctivitis. This is because the patient has a history of a pruritic eyelid lesion, which is a common presentation of viral conjunctivitis. The patient also has no vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, which are all more common in bacterial conjunctivitis. The patient's recent immigration from rural Moldova, where she had exposure to farm animals, is also a risk factor for viral conjunctivitis.

The next step in management is to perform a conjunctival biopsy. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the conjunctival swelling. The biopsy should be taken from the area of the conjunctiva that is most swollen. The biopsy should be sent for histopathologic examination and flow cytometry.

Title: Parotid Mass in an 81-Year-Old Woman Case is: An 81-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in her left cheek. She denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space (Figure 1). The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.Axial view of the contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrating the left cheek mass (arrowhead).What Is Your Diagnosis?

On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.

The differential diagnosis for a spindle cell neoplasm of the parotid gland includes myopericytoma, synovial sarcoma, neurofibroma, and solitary fibrous tumor. Myopericytoma is a rare mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in the extremities. It is composed of spindle cells that are positive for vimentin, desmin, and muscle-specific actin. Synovial sarcoma is a malignant mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in young adults. It is composed of spindle cells that are positive for CD99, SYT-SSX, and TLE1. Neurofibroma is a benign mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. It is composed of spindle cells that are positive for S100 protein. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare mesenchymal tumor that can occur anywhere in the body. It is composed of spindle cells that are positive for CD34 and bcl-2.

In this case, the patient is an elderly woman with a slow-growing mass in her parotid gland. The mass is abutting the parotid duct, which does not appear dilated. The core biopsy demonstrates a spindle cell neoplasm that is negative for CK8/18, S100, and SOX10, and positive for STAT6. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor.

Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological analysis and tissue cultures. Tissue culture results at 2 weeks remained negative, and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result was negative.

The differential diagnosis for a rapidly enlarging facial abscess includes pyoderma gangrenosum, lupus vulgaris, coccidioidomycosis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, noninfectious skin disease characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune disorders. Lupus vulgaris is a chronic, granulomatous skin disease that is a form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. It is most commonly seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that is endemic to the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and parts of the Caribbean. It is caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin, kidneys, lungs, heart, and other organs.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is pyoderma gangrenosum. This is supported by the patient's history of underlying systemic disease (immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance), the rapid progression of the lesion, the presence of suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis on biopsy, and the negative results of tissue culture and QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing.

Title: Supraventricular Tachycardia Following Mitral Valve Surgery Case is: A man in his mid-50s with a history of mitral valve repair presented to the emergency department with complaints of recent-onset palpitation within the last hour. On physical examination, the patient showed a rhythmic tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable (Figure 1A). The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained.

The correct answer is: **C. Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone.**

Reasoning:

The patient presented with a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves were recognizable. The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). PSVT is a common arrhythmia that can occur in people of all ages. It is usually caused by a re-entrant circuit in the heart. The most common type of PSVT is atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). AVRT occurs when there is an accessory pathway between the atria and the ventricles. This accessory pathway allows electrical signals to bypass the AV node, which is the normal pathway for electrical signals to travel from the atria to the ventricles. This can result in a rapid heart rate.

The treatment of PSVT depends on the patient's symptoms and the type of PSVT. In general, PSVT can be treated with medications, electrical cardioversion, or ablation. Medications that are used to treat PSVT include adenosine, verapamil, and digoxin. Electrical cardioversion is a procedure that uses an electric shock to stop the arrhythmia. Ablation is a procedure that uses heat or radiofrequency energy to destroy the accessory pathway.

In this case, the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not have any symptoms of heart failure or ischemia. Therefore, the first-line treatment would be to start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone. Low-molecular-weight heparin is an anticoagulant that can help to prevent blood clots. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can help to slow the heart rate.

If the patient does not respond to medical therapy, then electrical cardioversion or ablation may be necessary. Electrical cardioversion is a quick and effective way to stop PSVT. However, it is not a permanent solution. Ablation is a more permanent solution, but it is a more invasive procedure.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **C. Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone.**

The patient is a 31-year-old man with insidious onset of limited mobility of joints. He found his palms could not make full contact with each other (the “prayer sign”) 6 months prior, and has not been able to fully clench his fists for 2 months or squat for the past 10 days. No erythema, edema, or sclerotic skin plaque had been found on his limbs or trunk. No Raynaud phenomenon had occurred. His medical and family histories were unremarkable.

On examination, he showed bilateral limited mobility of interphalangeal (hands), metacarpophalangeal, wrist, interphalangeal (feet), metatarsophalangeal, and ankle joints. No muscular atrophy or sclerodactyly was found. The prayer sign (Figure 1A) and the “groove sign” (Figure 1B) were observed.

Blood test results indicated eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count, 1300 μL; reference, <500μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 31 mm/h; reference, <15 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 3.01 mg/dL; reference, <0.8 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase level, electrolyte level, thyroid function, globulin concentration, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) level were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram, cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, and plain radiographs of hands, wrists, feet, and ankles were normal. Nerve conduction studies performed in all 4 limbs were normal. Electromyography (EMG) showed spontaneous activities in muscles of limbs, including fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves (1+ or 2+). Myotonic discharges were seen in bilateral extensor digitorum.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with eosinophilic fasciitis, a rare, idiopathic inflammatory disorder characterized by skin thickening, eosinophilia, and pain. The most common presenting symptom is pain, which is typically described as deep, aching, and non-radiating. The skin thickening is usually symmetrical and involves the proximal extremities, trunk, and face. Eosinophilia is a characteristic finding in eosinophilic fasciitis, with absolute eosinophil counts typically greater than 1000 cells/μL. Other laboratory findings may include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may show thickening of the fascia and subcutaneous tissues. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) are typically normal.

The treatment of eosinophilic fasciitis is typically with corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, may also be used. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on nerves or tendons.

The prognosis for eosinophilic fasciitis is variable. Some patients have a complete remission with treatment, while others have a more chronic course. The disease can be associated with significant morbidity, including pain, disability, and cosmetic deformity.

Title: An 18-Year-Old Woman With Recurrent Skin, Nail, and Oral Mucosal Abnormalities Case is: An 18-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities. At age 4 years, she developed white oral plaques that resolved with oral nystatin. Approximately 6 months later, the oral plaques recurred, her toenails became thickened and yellowed, and red plaques appeared on both feet and lower legs. After 3 months of daily oral itraconazole, her skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities resolved for approximately 1 year. Over the following years, she received intermittent 3- to 6-month courses of daily itraconazole for recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities, which typically recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. Her last dose of itraconazole was approximately 2 years prior to presentation. On physical examination, the patient had white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures (Figure, left panel). She also had thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet bilaterally (Figure, right panel). Results of complete blood cell count with differential were normal, as were results of measurement of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels and analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets. Potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements. Fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans.Patient presentation. Left, White plaques in the oral mucosa and angular cheilitis. Right, Thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on both lower legs and feet.What Would You Do Next? A: Administer oral cefazolin , B: Prescribe hydrocortisone cream , C: Restart daily oral itraconazole , D: Treat with oral terbinafine. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of recurrent candidiasis, which is a fungal infection. Candidiasis can affect the skin, nails, and oral mucosa. The patient's current presentation is consistent with candidiasis, as she has white plaques in her oral mucosa, thickened and yellowed toenails, and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet. The potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings from the lower extremities demonstrated fungal elements, and the fungal culture of the skin scrapings grew Candida albicans. This confirms the diagnosis of candidiasis.

Oral itraconazole is the first-line treatment for candidiasis. Itraconazole is an antifungal medication that works by interfering with the fungal cell membrane. Itraconazole is available as a capsule, oral solution, and intravenous solution. The recommended dose of itraconazole for candidiasis is 200 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days.

In this case, the patient has a history of recurrent candidiasis. This suggests that she may have a chronic infection or an underlying condition that makes her more susceptible to candidiasis. It is important to treat candidiasis effectively to prevent complications, such as spread of the infection to other parts of the body and development of resistance to antifungal medications.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer in remission for which she was undergoing tamoxifen therapy, and prior bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis surgery. She presents with a 2-month history of increasing right-sided blurry vision and a sensation of eye dryness. She was found to have incomplete eyelid closure by her primary care physician, who initiated artificial tear lubrication and bedtime eyelid taping with partial symptom improvement.

On examination, she is noted to have right upper eyelid retraction with substantial static upper eyelid lag on downgaze. She has 1-mm right lagophthalmos with incomplete blink. Frontalis and orbicularis oculi strength are intact. She is measured to have a 2-mm relative right enophthalmos and no resistance to retropulsion. A review of patient photographs from 2 years prior showed symmetric bilateral eyelid appearance without retraction.

The differential diagnosis for right upper eyelid retraction includes:

* Graves' disease
* Thyroid ophthalmopathy
* Myasthenia gravis
* Orbital pseudotumor
* Orbital neoplasm
* Trauma
* Post-surgical

The most likely diagnosis in this case is Graves' disease. This is supported by the patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma, which is a known risk factor for Graves' disease. Additionally, the patient's presentation is consistent with Graves' disease, including right upper eyelid retraction, right lagophthalmos, and relative right enophthalmos.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order serum thyroid laboratory testing. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of Graves' disease and to assess the severity of the patient's hyperthyroidism. If the patient is found to have Graves' disease, she will be treated with a combination of medications to control her hyperthyroidism and to reduce her eyelid retraction.

Title: Pigmented Corneal Mass in a 59-Year-Old Man With Cutaneous Melanoma Case is: A 59-year-old man with history of cutaneous melanoma of the trunk was referred for evaluation of a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye. He denied any changes in vision, flashes, floaters, eye pain, or eye redness. He denied a history of trauma, intraocular surgery, or inflammation in the eyes. He had a history of stage 3B melanoma treated with ipilimumab complicated by grade 3 colitis refractory to high-dose corticosteroids and infliximab requiring colectomy and stomal hernia after hernia repair. Serial positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans showed no evidence of metabolically active disease. His medical history was notable for hypertension controlled with metoprolol. His mother had a history of breast cancer but otherwise family history was unremarkable.Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination showed inferior corneal endothelial pigmentation in the right eye (Figure, A) and trace nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes. He did not have ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels. Dilated ophthalmoscopy was unremarkable. Four-mirror gonioscopy in the right eye showed an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle (Figure, B). Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the right eye was unremarkable and did not show any masses.Prednisolone 4 times a day in the right eyeWhat Would You Do Next? A: Corneal biopsy , B: Surgical excision , C: Observation with close follow-up , D: Prednisolone 4 times a day in the right eye. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of cutaneous melanoma who presents with a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye. The lesion is well-demarcated and does not extend into the angle. There is no ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels. Dilated ophthalmoscopy is unremarkable. Four-mirror gonioscopy shows an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is unremarkable and does not show any masses.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented angle lesion includes a nevus, melanoma, and metastatic carcinoma. A nevus is a benign lesion that is typically small and flat. Melanoma is a malignant lesion that can be superficial spreading, nodular, or lentigo maligna melanoma. Metastatic carcinoma is a malignant lesion that has spread from another part of the body to the eye.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a nevus. The patient has a history of cutaneous melanoma, but the lesion in the right eye is small, well-demarcated, and does not extend into the angle. There is no ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels. Dilated ophthalmoscopy is unremarkable. Four-mirror gonioscopy shows an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is unremarkable and does not show any masses.

The next step in management is to observe the lesion with close follow-up. The patient should be seen every 3-6 months for a dilated eye examination and gonioscopy. If the lesion changes in size, shape, or color, or if there is any evidence of inflammation, then a biopsy should be performed.

Title: Persistent Vascular Lesion in a Young Boy Case is: A 3-year-old boy presented with a vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face. He had a pink macule on his left cheek at birth, which became raised and discolored around age 3 to 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with a capillary hemangioma, and propranolol was started at age 1 month with progression despite dosage increases. Topical timolol was tried without improvement; oral prednisolone decreased the size of the lesion, but was poorly tolerated and discontinued. An ophthalmic evaluation at an outside hospital was concerning for amblyopia because of anisohypermetropia, greater on the left, and a left esotropia and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image revealed an orbital mass surrounding the left lateral rectus muscle with mass effect on the globe and extension into the eyelid, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek.Given the risk of amblyopia, the patient underwent 2 embolization and debulking procedures of the orbital and cheek components of the lesion, which were positive for glucose transporter 1 on pathology. However, the esotropia abruptly worsened after the second debulking. At age 3 years, he presented to the clinic with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle showed inability to abduct past midline (Figure 1A). A repeated magnetic resonance image showed persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe (Figure 1B).Infantile hemangioma prior to treatment. A, Left abduction deficit (asterisk) from complex infantile hemangioma involving the orbit, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. Arrowhead indicates cheek component of hemangioma. B, Magnetic resonance imaging orbits axial image (postgadolinium, T1) showing enhancing orbital component (arrowhead).What Would You Do Next? A: Repeated trial of oral prednisolone , B: Interventional radiology embolization and debulking , C: Pulsed dye laser therapy , D: Oral sirolimus. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient has a complex infantile hemangioma involving the orbit, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. He has already undergone two embolization and debulking procedures, which were successful in reducing the size of the lesion but did not improve the esotropia. The patient now has a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle shows inability to abduct past midline. A repeated magnetic resonance image shows persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe.

Based on the information provided, the best course of treatment for this patient is oral sirolimus. Sirolimus is a medication that inhibits the growth of blood vessels. It has been shown to be effective in treating complex infantile hemangiomas that are resistant to other treatments. In a study of 12 patients with complex infantile hemangiomas, sirolimus was found to be effective in reducing the size of the lesions and improving vision.

Title: Saddle-Nose Deformity in the Setting of Diffuse Cutaneous Lesions in an African American Man Case is: A 66-year-old African American man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a several-month history of severe nasal congestion. Five years before this otolaryngology evaluation, the patient developed diffuse skin plaques with erythema and was subsequently diagnosed with hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The patient was treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. Owing to significant worsening of his symptoms 4 months before his evaluation, a biopsy of his cutaneous lesions was performed to rule out progression of CTCL (Figure 1). Physical examination demonstrated large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There were also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.A, Fite acid-fast stain of cutaneous lesion identifying pink bacilli (original magnification ×100).

The nasal septum demonstrated an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.

The differential diagnosis for saddle-nose deformity in the setting of diffuse cutaneous lesions includes sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lepromatous leprosy, and progression of mycosis fungoides.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in various organs. The most common sites of involvement are the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. Sarcoidosis can present with a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, weight loss, and skin lesions. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for sarcoidosis is typically aimed at relieving symptoms and controlling the disease activity.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels. The most common sites of involvement are the lungs, kidneys, and upper respiratory tract. GPA can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, blood in the urine, and skin lesions. The diagnosis of GPA is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for GPA is typically with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.

Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic, progressive form of leprosy that is characterized by the widespread dissemination of Mycobacterium leprae. The most common sites of involvement are the skin, nerves, and eyes. Lepromatous leprosy can present with a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, nerve damage, and eye problems. The diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and skin biopsy. Treatment for lepromatous leprosy is typically with multidrug therapy.

Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that is characterized by the development of skin lesions. The most common initial lesions are small, scaly patches or plaques. Mycosis fungoides can progress to involve deeper layers of the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides is made based on clinical findings, biopsy of a skin lesion, and immunophenotyping of the tumor cells. Treatment for mycosis fungoides depends on the stage of the disease. Early-stage disease may be treated with topical or systemic chemotherapy. More advanced disease may be treated with radiation therapy, bone marrow transplantation, or other aggressive therapies.

In the case presented, the patient has a several-month history of severe nasal congestion. He also has a history of hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). Physical examination demonstrates large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There are also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrates an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages were obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is progression of mycosis fungoides. The patient's history of CTCL, the presence of skin lesions consistent with CTCL, and the development of new symptoms, such as nasal congestion, are all consistent with progression of disease. Other possible diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lepromatous leprosy, are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

**Answer:**
The answer is D. Progression of mycosis fungoides.

Title: Progressive Hoarseness and Laryngeal Obstruction in an Elderly Man Case is: An otherwise healthy man in his 60s presented to a tertiary otolaryngology clinic reporting a 1-year medical history of progressively worsening hoarseness and dyspnea. He denied any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, cough, or reflux symptoms. There was no prior history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. He was treated for asthma with inhaled steroids by his primary care physician without improvement in symptoms. On physical examination, the patient was stridulous and considerably hoarse. His neck examination was unremarkable. Subsequent videostroboscopy revealed severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions (Figure 1A). There was right true vocal fold immobility with compensatory squeeze of the false vocal folds and an absent mucosal wave. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with contrast showed irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds but no evidence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy.

Laryngeal biopsy findings are shown in Figure 1, B and C.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is **tuberculosis**. Tuberculosis is a chronic, granulomatous infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is the most common cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. The disease is spread through the inhalation of airborne droplets from an infected person. The most common sites of infection are the lungs, but it can also affect other organs, including the larynx.

The clinical features of laryngeal tuberculosis include hoarseness, dyspnea, stridor, and hemoptysis. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy of the laryngeal mucosa. Treatment consists of a combination of anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. The prognosis for patients with laryngeal tuberculosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment.

The most likely diagnosis is **keloidal scleroderma**. Keloidal scleroderma is a rare, chronic, fibrosing skin disease that is characterized by the formation of keloids, which are hard, raised scars. The disease is most commonly seen in people of African descent, but it can occur in people of all races. The exact cause of keloidal scleroderma is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

The clinical features of keloidal scleroderma are variable. The most common presentation is the development of one or more keloids on the skin. The keloids are usually firm, red-brown, and raised. They may be pruritic or painful. In some cases, the keloids may become infected. Keloidal scleroderma can also cause fibrosis of the skin and underlying tissues. This can lead to the development of contractures, which are permanent tightening of the skin and underlying tissues. Contractures can limit range of motion and cause pain.

There is no cure for keloidal scleroderma, but there are treatments that can help to control the disease. Treatment typically involves the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids, as well as laser therapy or surgery. In some cases, a combination of treatments may be necessary.

Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain demonstrated diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes giant cell arteritis, anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis, immunoglobulin G4–related disease, and myasthenia gravis.

Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis that typically affects the temporal arteries. It can present with headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and vision loss. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. Treatment is with high-dose steroids.

Anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis is an autoimmune disease that affects skeletal muscle. It can present with proximal muscle weakness, fatigue, and muscle pain. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and elevated muscle enzymes levels. Treatment is with steroids and immunosuppressants.

Immunoglobulin G4–related disease is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, eyes, and kidneys. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, fever, and joint pain. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, such as elevated immunoglobulin G4 levels. Treatment is with steroids and immunosuppressants.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that affects the neuromuscular junction. It can present with fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles, particularly the muscles of the eyes, face, and limbs. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and a positive Tensilon test. Treatment is with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and immunosuppressants.

In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is giant cell arteritis. This is supported by the patient's history of headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness, as well as her elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. The diagnosis is confirmed by the findings on magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the brain, which demonstrate diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally.

Title: Bilateral Refractory Neurosensory Retinal and Pigment Epithelial Detachments Case is: An 88-year-old woman presented with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Ocular history included presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. Central serous chorioretinopathy was also suspected secondary to the presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye.Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. She had pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye. Fundus examination was remarkable for macular PEDs and SRF in each eye. There was an epiretinal membrane in the left eye.Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye disclosed a central PED with SRF that extended beyond the inferior border of the PED (Figure, A). Hyperreflective foci, suggestive of vitelliform material, were visible on the photoreceptors. OCT in the left eye demonstrated 2 PEDs in the parafovea (Figure, B). SRF was present with overlying thickening of the photoreceptors. The choroid was thin in each eye. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate hyperfluorescent staining within the body of the PEDs in each eye. There was no evidence of leakage in either eye. Fundus autofluorescence displayed dispersed, speckled hyperautofluorescence corresponding to the potential vitelliform material and SRF in the right eye. Review of the autofluorescence 3 years prior revealed boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence located in the most inferior aspect of the SRF in the right eye.Optical coherence tomography with corresponding autofluorescence image is shown in each eye. A, A 3000-μm-diameter pigment epithelial detachment with a 30-μm layer of subretinal fluid overlying the pigment epithelial detachment and a 140-μm layer of subretinal fluid inferior to the pigment epithelial detachment. Hyperreflective deposits on the photoreceptors are suggestive of vitelliform deposits (arrowheads). There are hyporeflective pockets within the pigment epithelial detachment possibly representing fluid. B, Two 500-μm pigment epithelial detachments with subretinal fluid and thickening of the photoreceptors in the left eye. An epiretinal membrane is visible.What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient has bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments. She has a history of presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. She has received 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but her condition has not improved.

The patient's visual acuity is 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. She has pseudophakia with an otherwise normal anterior segment examination in each eye. Fundus examination is remarkable for macular PEDs and SRF in each eye. There is an epiretinal membrane in the left eye.

Review of the autofluorescence 3 years prior revealed boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence located in the most inferior aspect of the SRF in the right eye.

The patient's condition is likely due to exudative age-related macular degeneration. The PEDs and SRF are caused by the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the choroid. The anti–VEGF injections have not been effective in treating the patient's condition.

The next step in the patient's management is to start photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that uses a light-activated drug to destroy abnormal blood vessels. It is a safe and effective treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration.

Title: Progressive Vision Loss in a Child With Cognitive Impairments Case is: A 9-year-old girl was referred to the pediatric retina service to evaluate progressive vision loss. Her medical history included neonatal seizures. She was initially evaluated at an outside institution and was found to have bilateral symmetric vision loss with nyctalopia. The onset of the symptoms was unknown. At that time, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/70 OU. The patient did not receive any ophthalmological care until 2 years later, when she was seen for marked vision loss and was noted to have a BCVA of light perception in both eyes.When she presented to the pediatric retina service, she demonstrated poor mentation and was unable to recall simple things such as the name of her siblings. Her BCVA was light perception. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Fundus autofluorescence disclosed attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence (Figure 1A). Color fundus photography showed optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography displayed decreased retinal thickness, more prominent in the inner layers, and hyper-reflective dots in the outer retinal layers. Family history included unilateral vision loss in her paternal grandmother in her late 20s. Both parents were healthy and denied consanguinity. The patient has 3 half sisters, all of whom are healthy.A, Fundus autofluorescence discloses attenuated, narrow vasculature and diffuse peripheral patchy hypoautofluorescence. B, Color fundus photograph displays optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation.What Would You Do Next? A: Electroretinogram , B: Genetic testing , C: Observation , D: Muscle biopsy. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has progressive vision loss with nyctalopia, poor mentation, and a family history of vision loss. The fundus examination shows optic disc pallor, attenuated retinal vasculature, prominent choroidal markings, and central retinal atrophy with diffusely mottled pigmentation. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). LCA is a rare, inherited retinal disorder that causes progressive vision loss from birth. There is no cure for LCA, but there are treatments that can help to slow the progression of the disease. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of LCA and help to identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the disease. This information can be used to provide genetic counseling to the patient and their family, and to identify other family members who may be at risk for LCA.

Answer: B. Genetic testing is the next step in the evaluation of this patient. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of LCA and help to identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the disease. This information can be used to provide genetic counseling to the patient and their family, and to identify other family members who may be at risk for LCA.

Title: Recurrent and Recalcitrant Salivary Gland Swelling in a Woman Case is: A 32-year-old Black woman presented with a 1-year history of facial swelling, predominantly in the right preauricular and left submandibular regions. Her symptoms began after relocation to California and occurred more frequently at her home. However, she could not discern any environmental or dietary triggers. She reported pruritus and swelling, which were usually moderate but occasionally severe, prompting several emergency department visits. During an emergency department visit, she was diagnosed with acute parotitis based on clinical and radiographic findings of diffuse gland edema, without salivary stones or masses. Her symptoms responded to oral prednisone bursts and diphenhydramine, but not to second-generation antihistamines or montelukast.Her workup included immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, all of which were within normal limits. A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils (normal, <6%) and an absolute eosinophil count 500/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Titers for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) were negative.Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures. Concurrent steroid irrigation did not provide any substantial benefit. An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma. Given the frequency and severity of her symptoms along with multiple treatment failures, she opted to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy, which proceeded without complications. Further histologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, as seen in the Figure.Medium-powered (A) and high-powered (B) field from the superficial parotid gland (hematoxylin-eosin).What Is Your Diagnosis?

The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic sialodochitis. Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder of the salivary glands that is characterized by periductal eosinophilic infiltration. The exact cause of eosinophilic sialodochitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The most common symptoms of eosinophilic sialodochitis are recurrent swelling and pain of the salivary glands. Other symptoms may include itching, fever, and fatigue. The diagnosis of eosinophilic sialodochitis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Imaging studies, such as sialendoscopy and CT scan, may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Treatment of eosinophilic sialodochitis typically involves a combination of oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected salivary gland.

Title: Congenital Cystic Neck Mass in a 2-Month-Old Infant Case is: A 2-month-old, full-term female presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. Her parents reported no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion (Figure, A and B). Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure (Figure, C); the capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. A, Axial: the blue arrowhead indicates extension into the tongue musculature, the yellow arrowhead indicates focally thickened capsule posteriorly, and the white arrowhead indicates a displaced sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Based on the history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a branchial cleft cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are congenital anomalies that arise from the remnants of the branchial arches. They are most commonly located in the lateral neck, but can also occur in the anterior neck or mediastinum. Branchial cleft cysts are typically lined by squamous epithelium and may contain serous or mucinous fluid. They can be asymptomatic or may present with a mass, pain, or infection. The treatment of branchial cleft cysts is surgical excision.

Reasoning:
The patient is an otherwise healthy man in his early 70s who presented with a 2-year history of a mildly pruritic, erythematous, and gradually enlarging lesion on the proximal portion of his left calf. The lesion had appeared without an identifiable cause, and for the previous 2 months, the patient had applied topical corticosteroids and antifungals with no improvement. Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque that was slightly raised but with an atrophic appearance. A skin biopsy was obtained for histopathology examination.

The histopathology findings showed a band-like vascular proliferation in the upper dermis with no grenz zone, round vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelial cells without atypia, and CD34 immunostaining labeling endothelial cells. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of acquired elastotic hemangioma.

Acquired elastotic hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that typically occurs in older adults. It is characterized by a band-like proliferation of ectatic capillaries in the upper dermis. The lesion is usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis is made on clinical and histopathologic grounds. Treatment is not usually necessary, but topical corticosteroids or laser therapy may be helpful in some cases.

Title: A Young Man With Syncope Case is: A man in his early 20s presented with suspected syncope and shaking with no significant medical history. The patient fell asleep and his girlfriend tried to wake him, but he started shaking and slumped over on the ground. He denied confusion afterward but did not feel well with nausea, flushing, chest tightness, and a rapid heart rate. About 10 minutes later, he had a second syncopal episode for 2 to 3 minutes with more than 20 muscle jerks. On presentation at the emergency department, he was afebrile, blood pressure was 120/59 mm Hg, heart rate was 85 beats per min, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. His cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs.The electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed early on arrival in the emergency department (Figure). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 54%, mild right ventricular (RV) dilation (RV diameter, 4.1 cm), and no significant valvular abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. Neurology consultation was obtained with concern for an epileptic seizure event surrounding the recurrent syncopal episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram  were obtained, both of which results were normal. On further questioning, patient reported having a second cousin with sudden cardiac death of uncertain etiology in his early 20s.Initial electrocardiogram on presentation in the emergency department.What Would You Do Next? A: 30-Day ambulatory event monitor , B: Electrophysiology study , C: Implantable cardioverter defibrillator , D: Ventricular ablation. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is a young man with a history of syncope and shaking. He has a family history of sudden cardiac death. His physical examination and initial laboratory tests are normal. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block and nonspecific ST-segment changes. The transthoracic echocardiogram shows mild right ventricular dilation. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging shows no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function. The neurology consultation was unrevealing.

The differential diagnosis for syncope includes cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, seizures, and psychogenic syncope. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a cardiac arrhythmia as the cause of his syncope. The ECG shows a right bundle branch block, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias. The transthoracic echocardiogram shows mild right ventricular dilation, which can be a sign of a cardiac arrhythmia. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging shows no RV abnormalities and qualitatively normal RV function, which makes it less likely that the patient has a right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The neurology consultation was unrevealing, which makes it less likely that the patient has a seizure disorder.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a 30-day ambulatory event monitor. This will allow for continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and will help to identify any arrhythmias that may be causing his syncope. If an arrhythmia is identified, then the patient may need to be treated with medication or a pacemaker. If no arrhythmia is identified, then the patient may need to undergo further testing, such as an electrophysiology study or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

Title: Bilateral Papilledema and Intact Vision With Normal Intracranial Pressure Case is: A 23-year-old woman presented with 6 months of intermittent bilateral retro-orbital pain associated with blurred vision and wavy lines in the vision of both eyes, followed by worsening numbness and tingling of her hands and legs. Medical history was notable for mild obesity (body mass index of 30 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]).Visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with briskly reactive pupils OU and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OU. Ishihara color plates were 13/13 OU. Extraocular movements were full. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed blurring and elevation of the nasal margins of the optic disc consistent with grade 1 optic disc edema in both eyes (Figure). Optical coherence tomography showed an elevated mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of 170 μm OD and 150 μm OS. Automated visual fields demonstrated subtle enlargement of the blind spots.Fundus photography demonstrating bilateral grade 1 optic disc edema.On neurologic examination, she had moderate weakness of dorsiflexors at the ankles bilaterally as well as toe extensors and everters. There was large and small fiber sensory loss distally in the legs.Findings of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR venography of the head were unremarkable. Electromyography suggested a brachial plexopathy. Lumbar puncture showed a normal opening pressure of 170 mm Hg with a cerebrospinal fluid protein of 113 mg/dL and 2 nucleated white blood cells. Serum studies were notable for a thrombocytosis of 479 × 103/μL (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) and an elevated quantitative monoclonal IgA λ-protein level of 492 mg/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01).What Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presented with bilateral papilledema and intact vision with normal intracranial pressure. This is a classic presentation of pseudotumor cerebri, a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion. The most common cause of pseudotumor cerebri is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), which is a diagnosis of exclusion. Other potential causes of pseudotumor cerebri include venous sinus thrombosis, medications (e.g., steroids, oral contraceptives), and neoplasms.
The initial diagnostic workup for pseudotumor cerebri typically includes a head CT scan, MRI of the brain, and lumbar puncture. The head CT scan is typically normal in IIH, but it may show evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or a mass lesion. The MRI of the brain may show evidence of optic nerve sheath enlargement or meningeal enhancement, but it is also typically normal in IIH. The lumbar puncture is typically performed to measure the opening pressure and to assess the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for evidence of infection, inflammation, or malignancy. The opening pressure in IIH is typically elevated, but it may be normal in up to 20% of cases. The CSF protein level is typically normal or mildly elevated in IIH, and the CSF cell count is typically normal.
In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of IIH. The patient's head CT scan, MRI of the brain, and lumbar puncture are all normal. Therefore, the next step in management is to start acetazolamide, a medication that is used to lower intracranial pressure. Acetazolamide is typically started at a dose of 250 mg twice daily and can be increased as needed to control the patient's symptoms. Other treatment options for IIH include weight loss, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and lumboperitoneal shunt placement.

Title: An Unusual Case of Severe Bilateral Extraocular Muscle Enlargement Case is: A 47-year-old woman with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) status in remission after liver transplant was hospitalized for workup of a new pancreatic mass concerning for recurrence. Several days into her hospital course, she developed acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia as well as occasional flushing and palpitations. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. She had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes (Figure 1A).

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of serology-negative thyroid eye disease (TED). TED is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles and tissues around the eyes. It is characterized by proptosis, periorbital edema, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia. In most cases, TED is associated with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. However, it can also occur in patients with no history of thyroid disease.

The patient's laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of TED. Her thyrotropin, T3, and T4 levels are all within normal limits, which suggests that she does not have Graves' disease. Her thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody, antimicrosomal antibody, IgG4, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies are all negative, which further supports the diagnosis of TED.

The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of TED. The MRI shows bilateral and symmetric tendon-sparing extraocular muscle enlargement with nodular heterogenous enhancement. This is a characteristic finding of TED.

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of serology-negative TED. The next step in management is to start intravenous corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for TED. They help to reduce inflammation and swelling of the extraocular muscles.

Title: Elevated Intraocular Pressure With Visual Deterioration in a Pseudophakic Eye Case is: A 78-year-old White man was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unexplained subjective decrease in vision for more than 6 months, more pronounced in the right eye, and insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). Local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker was used regularly in both eyes owing to long-standing primary open-angle glaucoma. Uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and in-the-bag insertion of an intraocular lens was performed 10 years earlier in both eyes.  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and 0.5 (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 and 20/40) OD and OS, respectively. His manifest refraction revealed a difference of −0.75 D sphere compared with his own preexisting glasses in the right eye. IOP was 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye.Slitlamp examination revealed a milky substance in the retrolental space, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure) but evident in both. The rest of the slitlamp examination was unremarkable with moderate superficial punctate keratitis owing to ocular surface disease, an anterior chamber depth of Van Herick grade 4 (peripheral anterior chamber depth >1 corneal thickness), an absence of anterior chamber inflammation, and a moderate amount of Elschnig pearls in both eyes.Right eye with milky-opaque substance (between white arrowheads) in the retrolental space and distension of the capsular bag.

The correct answer is D: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics.

The patient has a milky substance in the retrolental space, which is more pronounced in the right eye. This is consistent with a diagnosis of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). PCO is a common complication of cataract surgery, and it can cause blurred vision and glare.

The patient's IOP is 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. This is elevated, and it is likely contributing to the patient's visual symptoms.

The patient is currently being treated with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker. This is a standard treatment for glaucoma, but it is not effective in treating PCO.

The patient's IOP is not controlled with medical therapy, and he has visual symptoms from PCO. The next step in management is to perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can remove the milky substance from the retrolental space and restore the patient's vision.

Reasoning:

* The patient has a milky substance in the retrolental space, which is consistent with a diagnosis of PCO.
* PCO is a common complication of cataract surgery, and it can cause blurred vision and glare.
* The patient's IOP is 24 mm Hg in the right eye and 18 mm Hg in the left eye. This is elevated, and it is likely contributing to the patient's visual symptoms.
* The patient is currently being treated with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker. This is a standard treatment for glaucoma, but it is not effective in treating PCO.
* The patient's IOP is not controlled with medical therapy, and he has visual symptoms from PCO. The next step in management is to perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics.

Title: Sudden-Onset Monocular Blurry Vision in a Young Woman Case is: A 32-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital for fever, flulike symptoms, and altered mental status developed sudden-onset blurry vision in her right eye. Her history was notable for phthisis in her left eye due to a left orbit clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease, after surgical excision and radiation, with recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol. After completing 2 days of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antivirals for presumed septic meningitis, her laboratory and imaging results returned negative and she was transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg). One day later, her mental status improved, and she reported central blurry vision in her right eye. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 in this eye, she had normal intraocular pressure, and there was no evidence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Dilated fundus examination revealed segmental areas of venous sheathing (Figure 1A) in the right eye and was not possible in the left eye owing to phthisis. An optical coherence tomography scan of the right eye revealed hyperreflective changes along the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and especially the interdigitation zone (Figure 1B).A, Color fundus photograph of the right eye at the time of presentation demonstrating segmental areas of venous sheathing (white arrowheads).

Reasoning:
The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a rare but potentially devastating complication of immunotherapy. PRES is characterized by headache, seizures, encephalopathy, and visual changes, including blurry vision. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment for PRES is supportive, and the prognosis is generally good with early recognition and treatment.

In this case, the patient's blurry vision is a new symptom that developed after she was started on intravenous methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, including PRES. However, corticosteroids can also worsen PRES, so it is important to consider this possibility when evaluating a patient with blurry vision who is taking corticosteroids.

The patient's history of clear cell sarcoma and recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol also raises the possibility of PRES. Clear cell sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the eyes, bones, and other organs. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. PRES has been reported in patients with clear cell sarcoma who are treated with immunotherapy.

In order to make a diagnosis of PRES, it is important to obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol that the patient is receiving. This information will help to determine if the patient is at risk for PRES and will guide treatment decisions.

Title: Cervical Lymphadenopathy in an Elderly Man Case is: A White man in his 70s with a medical history notable only for mitral valve repair was incidentally found to have cervical lymphadenopathy on magnetic resonance imaging while undergoing workup for shoulder pain. A fine-needle biopsy of an enlarged left-sided cervical lymph node yielded benign results. One month later, he presented to a local emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Symptoms began 6 weeks earlier and had been intermittent in nature. He had also experienced fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss for 6 weeks. He otherwise denied having fevers, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or easy bruising. Physical examination revealed bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in addition to mild diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory results revealed a hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), a white blood cell count of 6.4 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 404 × 103/μL  (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1) in addition to negative results for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays. Additional workup results were notable for elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10 (1091 pg/mL), IL-6 (3.1 pg/mL), C-reactive protein (4.9 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h). A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis further revealed extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of mitral valve repair who presents with cervical lymphadenopathy, fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss. He also has diffuse abdominal pain. On physical examination, he has bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory results reveal an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography further demonstrates fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. An excisional biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node shows a proliferation of slitlike blood vessels and regression of the lymphoid follicle, with onion-skinning of mantle zone lymphocytes and hypervascularity. Scattered atypical plasma cells are present.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease. Multicentric Castleman disease is a rare, non-neoplastic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by a proliferation of B cells and plasma cells. It is typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. The disease can occur at any age but is most common in middle-aged adults. There is no known cure for multicentric Castleman disease, but treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents can help to control the symptoms.

Reasoning: The patient is a man in his 40s with a long-standing history of poorly controlled HIV. He presented to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, odynophagia, and recurrent oral and perianal ulcers. He was found to have pancytopenia and septic shock. During admission in the intensive care unit, treatment with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for presumed infection and oral fluconazole for thrush led to improvement in the patient’s medical condition, but the ulcers persisted. Dermatology was consulted for input on the cause of the ulcers, which had been ongoing for approximately 6 months prior; individual lesions lasted 1 to 3 weeks before self-resolving. Biopsy of an oral mucosal lesion performed 1 month earlier had shown nonspecific inflammation. Examination revealed exquisitely tender, ovoid, punched-out ulcerations of the inferior lip and scrapeable white plaques on the tongue, right buccal mucosa, and external anal mucosa. A punch biopsy from 1 of the perianal ulcers was performed.

The histopathology of the perianal lesion showed a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, with prominent admixed large and atypical cells at high power. Epstein-Barr virus–encoded RNA staining showed scattered positivity in some cells.

The most likely diagnosis is Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers. This is supported by the patient’s history of poorly controlled HIV, the presence of recurrent oral and perianal ulcers, the histopathologic findings of the perianal lesion, and the positive Epstein-Barr virus–encoded RNA staining.

Title: Bilateral Complete Ophthalmoplegia in a 50-Year-Old Man Case is: A 50-year-old man was referred for ophthalmoplegia that developed immediately after an 8.5-hour robotic cystectomy for small cell cancer of the bladder. After recovering from anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit, he experienced headache, facial numbness, inability to open both his eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction.He had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in sella turcica with compression of the optic chiasm and mild mass effect on the pons that was felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma (Figure). His baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 OU with intact extraocular movements and unremarkable confrontational fields, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields.T1-weighted coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast shows a 4.9 × 4.6 × 5.2-cm sellar/parasellar lobulated mass with homogenous enhancement before symptom onset (A), which became 5.3 × 5.1 × 5.3 cm and had loss of enhancement after symptom onset (B). The mass caused superior displacement of the optic chiasm and had extension into the cavernous sinus bilaterally. The mass also extended posteriorly and deformed the anterior aspect of the pons (not shown). After symptom onset, the mass was hyperintense on T2-weighted images (not shown).During the bedside examination in the postanesthesia care unit, he was noted to have complete bilateral ptosis. His visual acuity was 20/20 OU with full visual fields on confrontational visual field testing. He had decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally. The right and left pupils were 5 mm and 6 mm in size, respectively, in both light and dark. There was no pupillary response to light or accommodation. No exophthalmos was noted. Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. The patient was unable to move either eye in any direction on extraocular motility testing. Vestibulo-ocular reflex did not overcome the ophthalmoplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained 12 hours after symptom onset redemonstrating the large sellar mass, which no longer had central enhancement (Figure).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. She presents with sudden onset of painless jaundice and 8 days of malaise. Her last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation. She is not taking any prescription or herbal medications and had not been prescribed suppressive antiviral medication for chronic HBV infection. She reports no history of travel outside the US and no raw meat ingestion. Her vital signs, mentation, and physical examination were normal except for scleral icterus. Results of blood testing were negative for hepatitis C virus RNA, anti–hepatitis A IgM, and HIV antibody. Other selected laboratory values are shown in the Table. A liver ultrasound performed 6 months prior to presentation and a repeat liver ultrasound with Doppler revealed no abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis is acute hepatitis B reactivation. This is supported by the patient's history of chronic HBV infection, her recent intravenous heroin use, and the absence of other causes of acute hepatitis, such as hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis A virus infection, or HIV infection.

The next step in management is to order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA. HDV is a defective virus that requires HBV to replicate. HDV infection can occur in patients with chronic HBV infection, and it can cause a more severe acute hepatitis than HBV infection alone.

**Reasoning:**
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of cartilage. The most common sites of involvement are the ears, nose, and joints. Other possible manifestations include inflammation of the eyes, lungs, heart, and skin.

The laboratory findings in RP are non-specific and can include an elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). There is no definitive diagnostic test for RP, and the diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and supportive laboratory findings.

The treatment of RP is aimed at controlling inflammation and preventing disease progression. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the mainstay of therapy. Other medications that may be used include immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide.

In the case of the patient described above, the most appropriate next step is to perform chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT). This is because the patient has a history of cough and weight loss, which could be indicative of pulmonary involvement. Chest radiography and PFT can help to assess the extent of pulmonary disease and to monitor the patient's response to treatment.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines who presents with 9 months of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which is more notable at night and with fatigue. She denies experiencing pain, diplopia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, difficulty breathing, or other neurologic deficits.

On examination, corrected visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally, with normal color vision, visual fields, intraocular pressure, extraocular movements, alignment, and pupils. External examination is notable for left upper eyelid ptosis (Figure 1), with a margin-to-reflex distance 1 of 3.5 mm on the right and 0.5 mm on the left, intact levator function, and no fatiguability on sustained upgaze. There was no evidence of eyelid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation. There were no palpable adnexal masses or orbital rim deformities, but there was mild fullness in the left superior sulcus and mildly increased left-sided resistance to retropulsion. However, Hertel exophthalmometry did not reveal any relative proptosis. No lacrimal gland abnormalities or conjunctival masses were seen with upper eyelid eversion. There was no palpable preauricular or cervical lymphadenopathy. Slitlamp and fundus examination findings were normal. Serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibody were negative.

The differential diagnosis for left upper eyelid ptosis includes myasthenia gravis, third cranial nerve palsy, Horner's syndrome, and mechanical ptosis. Myasthenia gravis is the most common cause of acquired ptosis, and it is characterized by fluctuating ptosis that is worse with fatigue. Third cranial nerve palsy is characterized by ptosis, diplopia, and an inability to elevate the eye. Horner's syndrome is characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Mechanical ptosis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including tumors, trauma, and inflammation.

The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient has a history of chronic migraines, which can be associated with myasthenia gravis. The patient's ptosis is worse at night and with fatigue, which is also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's levator function is intact, which suggests that the ptosis is not due to a third cranial nerve palsy. The patient's examination findings are otherwise normal, which suggests that the ptosis is not due to Horner's syndrome or a mechanical cause.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a single-fiber electromyography (EMG). Single-fiber EMG is a sensitive test for myasthenia gravis. The test involves inserting a needle electrode into a muscle and recording the electrical activity of individual muscle fibers. In patients with myasthenia gravis, there is a characteristic pattern of electrical activity that is consistent with the diagnosis.

If the single-fiber EMG is positive for myasthenia gravis, the next step is to perform a Tensilon test. The Tensilon test is a diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis. The test involves injecting the patient with a short-acting anticholinesterase medication, such as edrophonium chloride (Tensilon). In patients with myasthenia gravis, the Tensilon test will result in a temporary improvement in the ptosis.

If the Tensilon test is positive, the patient will be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. The treatment for myasthenia gravis includes medications, such as pyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon) and prednisone. In some cases, patients may also need to undergo surgery, such as thymectomy.

Title: Sudden-Onset Headache and Binocular Vertical Diplopia in a Young Patient Case is: A 24-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. She denied any other neurologic symptoms. Her medical history included untreated hyperprolactinemia manifested by galactorrhea and oligomenorrhea. She did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol.On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia (Video), which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well.Check thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels and order orbital imagingOrder urgent computed tomography scan and computed tomography angiography of the brainWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is concerning for thyroid eye disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause diplopia, headache, and other symptoms. Thyroid eye disease is associated with elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid receptor antibodies. Orbital imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to assess the degree of inflammation in the orbit and the optic nerve. If orbital imaging is normal, then computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the brain can be used to rule out other causes of headache and diplopia, such as a brain tumor or aneurysm. Acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers are used to diagnose myasthenia gravis, which is another autoimmune disorder that can cause diplopia. Lumbar puncture is not necessary in the setting of thyroid eye disease or myasthenia gravis.

Title: Unilateral Intraocular Lens Implant Subluxation in an Adult Case is: A middle-aged patient with a remote history of bilateral juvenile cataracts after posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement presented with decreased vision in the right eye for several months. There was no recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. At the time of the initial examination, visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a refraction of −1.50 diopters (D) sphere in both eyes. Examination was notable for a superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and an inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye. Results of the fundus examination were reported to be normal in both eyes and the anterior examination of the left eye was notable for only a well-positioned PCIOL. The patient was referred to a cornea specialist for further evaluation and treatment.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, specialty evaluation occurred 10 weeks later at which time the patient complained of progressive vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity measured hand motion in the right eye with normal intraocular pressure. The PCIOL was subluxed inferotemporally with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). A 4 mm × 3.1-mm superonasal pigmented scleral lesion was also noted (Figure 1B). The examination of the left eye was remarkable only for a well-centered PCIOL and iris transillumination defects.A, Slitlamp photography of the right eye showing the inferotemporal intraocular lens implant subluxation (arrowhead).

Reasoning:
The patient has a subluxed intraocular lens (IOL) in the right eye. This is a serious condition that can lead to vision loss. The first step is to stabilize the IOL. This can be done by suture fixation or exchange. Once the IOL is stable, the underlying cause of the subluxation can be addressed. In this case, the patient also has a pigmented scleral lesion. This lesion could be a tumor or a non-cancerous growth. It is important to biopsy the lesion to determine the diagnosis and to rule out a malignancy.

Title: A Child With Severe Autism Spectrum Disorder With Bilateral Corneal Ulcers Case is: A 6-year-old boy with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was brought to the hospital by his mother for whitening in the right eye. The patient was nonverbal at baseline and exhibited restrictive and repetitive behaviors. His diet consisted exclusively of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade. His mother noticed him frequently rubbing his eyes for several weeks, which she initially attributed to new-onset allergies. She did not describe any reduction in visual function or ability to perform low-luminance tasks.The patient was admitted and ophthalmology was consulted. He required an examination under sedation. His visual acuity could not be determined. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect in either eye. The eyelids were mildly erythematous with bilateral eyelash hypertrichosis. The conjunctiva and cornea appeared dry and leathery bilaterally. The right cornea was diffusely hazy with a 3-mm paracentral epithelial defect with 60% stromal thinning and a 1-mm infiltrate. There was a small crescentic fibrin deposit nasally in the right anterior chamber. The left cornea was diffusely hazy with a 1-mm epithelial defect without stromal thinning (Figure). Dilated examination showed bilateral grade 3 optic nerve head edema and otherwise normal retinal findings. Fortified vancomycin eye drops, 25 mg/mL, and tobramycin eye drops, 15 mg/mL, were initiated. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal.Photographs of the right (A) and left (B) eyes reveal a dry and lusterless appearance of the conjunctivae and corneas of both eyes.

Reasoning:
The patient has bilateral corneal ulcers with 60% stromal thinning in the right eye. This is a severe condition that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. The most likely cause of the ulcers is a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus. Other possible causes include bacterial infection, fungal infection, or autoimmune disease.

The initial treatment for corneal ulcers is to apply topical antibiotics and antivirals. If the ulcers do not respond to treatment, or if they are caused by a fungal infection, then a corneal transplant may be necessary.

In this case, the patient's ulcers are severe and have not responded to treatment with topical antibiotics and antivirals. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform a corneal transplant.

**Reasoning:**
The patient presented with a 24-hour history of severe dizziness that she described as “room spinning,” right aural fullness, and a subjective right-sided hearing loss. She denied any medical history of vertigo, recent upper respiratory infection, head trauma, or prior otologic surgery. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities on otoscopic evaluation; however, a strongly positive right-sided Dix−Hallpike test was elicited with rotary nystagmus; a subsequent Epley maneuver was performed. The patient’s symptoms subjectively worsened during the following several days. Therefore, an audiogram test (Figure 1) and computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone were performed. Preoperative audiogram reveals a right-sided low- to mid-frequency moderate conductive hearing loss and a bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. dB denotes decibels; HTL, hearing threshold level; SL, sensation level; SRT, speech reception threshold; and TDH, telephonic dynamic headphones.

The most likely diagnosis is **superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome**. This is a rare disorder that is characterized by a defect in the bony wall of the superior semicircular canal. This can lead to symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. The Dix−Hallpike test is a diagnostic test that is used to assess for superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome. In this test, the patient is rapidly moved from a sitting position to a supine position with the head turned to one side. This can cause a sensation of vertigo and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) in patients with superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome. The Epley maneuver is a treatment for superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome. This maneuver involves repositioning the head in a series of steps to help move the otoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) out of the superior semicircular canal.

The other possible diagnoses are:

* **Pneumolabyrinth** is a condition in which there is air in the inner ear. This can cause symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. However, the Dix−Hallpike test is usually negative in patients with pneumolabyrinth.
* **Labyrintitis** is an inflammation of the inner ear. This can cause symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. However, the Dix−Hallpike test is usually positive in patients with labyrinthitis.
* **Meniere disease** is a disorder that affects the inner ear. This can cause symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and fullness in the ear. However, the Dix−Hallpike test is usually negative in patients with Meniere disease.

Title: Unilateral Progressively Growing Neck Mass in a Young Adult Case is: An 18-year-old male presented to the primary care physician with a 4-month history of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. The patient denied any history of dysphagia, dysphonia, drainage, previous neck surgery, trauma, or recent fever. There was no significant medical or family history of thyroid disease. On examination, the mass moved with swallowing. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement (Figure, A). The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion (Figure, B). Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a young male with a slowly progressive painless neck mass. The mass is located in the right thyroid lobe and is associated with tracheal compression. The patient has normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and calcium levels, and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. Neck ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion with a diameter of 5.9 cm in the right thyroid lobe without any internal solid nodularity or septation. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an intrathyroidal lesion extending inferiorly to 3 cm above the angle of Louis causing tracheal compression and displacement. The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy to relieve tracheal compression. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion. Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH.

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid cyst. Parathyroid cysts are rare, benign lesions that occur in the parathyroid glands. They are typically asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms if they are large enough to compress surrounding structures. Parathyroid cysts are usually diagnosed on imaging studies, such as neck ultrasonography or CT scan. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction that is treated with warfarin. She denied any personal or family history of cancer. She was previously briefly a smoker. A physical examination revealed no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. Her cranial nerves were intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa was intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces. A follow-up CT was performed 6 weeks later, which showed that the mass had grown significantly in size.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is primary parotid gland cancer. Parotid gland cancer is the most common type of salivary gland cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of all cases. It is a relatively rare cancer, with an estimated incidence of 2-3 cases per 100,000 people per year. The peak incidence is in the sixth and seventh decades of life.

The most common presenting symptom of parotid gland cancer is a painless mass in the parotid gland. Other symptoms may include facial nerve paralysis, facial pain, and ear pain. The diagnosis of parotid gland cancer is usually made based on a physical examination and imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. A biopsy is usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of parotid gland cancer depends on the stage of the disease. Early-stage tumors can be treated with surgery alone. More advanced tumors may require a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for parotid gland cancer is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of 70-80% for early-stage tumors. However, the prognosis for more advanced tumors is lower, with a 5-year survival rate of 40-50%.

Reasoning: The patient is a 2-year-old girl with a 10-month history of asymptomatic skin depressions in her neck, nape, and submandibular regions. The lesion initially occurred as an erythema in the neck and progressed centrifugally to the nape and submandibular areas. Atrophy was observed in the center of the lesion, surrounded by an erythematous border, with underlying blood vessels being visible deep to the atrophy. Biopsy specimen taken from the edge of the depressed lesion showed normal epidermis and dermis, no inflammatory cell infiltration within the dermis, and somewhat diminished subcutaneous fatty tissue. Ultrasonographic findings showed markedly thinner subcutaneous fat of the skin. Cervical lymph nodes were palpable bilaterally. Tactile responses within the depressed as well as surrounding areas were normal. Other physical examinations were without abnormalities. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Her parents denied drug injection or trauma history. Results of routine laboratory tests, HIV test, serological test of antibodies for Borrelia, and antinuclear antibody test were within normal limits or negative.

The most likely diagnosis is lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis (LCAI). LACI is a rare, benign, self-limited disorder of unknown etiology characterized by progressive atrophy of subcutaneous fat, typically in the abdomen and buttocks. It usually presents in infants or young children, and most cases resolve spontaneously within a few years. The diagnosis is made clinically, based on the characteristic history and physical findings. There is no specific treatment for LACI, but supportive measures such as topical emollients and massage may help to improve the appearance of the skin.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Morphea is a chronic, autoimmune disorder characterized by sclerosis of the skin. It usually presents as a single, well-defined plaque of indurated skin, but it can also be multifocal or generalized. Lupus panniculitis is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and necrosis of subcutaneous fat. It usually presents as a single, painful, erythematous nodule, but it can also be multifocal or generalized. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a rare, benign disorder of unknown etiology characterized by necrosis of subcutaneous fat in the newborn. It usually presents as a single, painful, erythematous nodule, but it can also be multifocal or generalized.

Title: Progressive Parkinsonism With Features of Mitochondrial Disease Case is: A man aged 44 years was referred for progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response. His medical history comprised unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. At age 23 years, he had bilateral cataract surgery, and over the last 2 years, he developed worsening stiffness and walking difficulties with frequent falls. He reported features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors (Video). There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies.A, Axial fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging shows reduced FDG uptake in the left frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes, as well as subtle hypometabolism in the left basal ganglia and left thalamus.

Reasoning:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by parkinsonism, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, postural instability, and cognitive decline. The patient's history of unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis are not specific for PSP, but they are not uncommon in patients with the disorder. The patient's neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors. This is consistent with the parkinsonism seen in PSP. The patient also had full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. This is a characteristic finding in PSP. The patient's neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills. This is also consistent with the cognitive decline seen in PSP. The patient's systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing were normal. Cranial MRI showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. This is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including PSP. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. This is also a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including PSP. Total-body PET using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions. This is consistent with the lack of inflammation or infection seen in PSP. However, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis. This is a characteristic finding in PSP. As the patient's cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are characteristic of PSP.

Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient is a 44-year-old man with a 2-year history of progressive parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and REM sleep behavior disorder. He has no family history of movement disorders. His examination shows hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors. Neuropsychological assessment reveals significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing are normal. Cranial MRI shows mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrates slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body PET using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer shows no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis. A brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex shows scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies.

The most likely diagnosis is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive parkinsonism, vertical gaze palsy, and cognitive decline. It is typically diagnosed in middle-aged to older adults. The cause of PSP is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by the death of cells in the brainstem and basal ganglia. There is no cure for PSP, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

The other possible diagnoses are mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), autosomal recessive parkinsonism, and paraneoplastic syndrome. MELAS is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by seizures, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. It is typically diagnosed in children and young adults. The cause of MELAS is a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. There is no cure for MELAS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Autosomal recessive parkinsonism is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by progressive parkinsonism. It is typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The cause of autosomal recessive parkinsonism is a mutation in one of several genes. There is no cure for autosomal recessive parkinsonism, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Paraneoplastic syndrome is a rare, neurological disorder that occurs when a tumor produces antibodies that attack the nervous system. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and seizures. The treatment for paraneoplastic syndrome depends on the underlying tumor.

In the case of the patient described above, the most likely diagnosis is PSP. This is based on the patient's age, the progressive nature of his symptoms, and the findings on his imaging studies and brain biopsy. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history and presentation.

Punch biopsies of the scalp and left hand revealed a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with marked edema without vasculitis. No organisms were seen using special stains for bacteria, fungi, and acid-fast organisms.

The most likely diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum, a neutrophilic dermatosis that can be associated with underlying systemic diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, myelodysplastic syndromes, and hematologic malignancies. The patient's history of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss raises the possibility of an underlying malignancy. The presence of an acute DVT is also concerning for an underlying malignancy.

The next step in management is to perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics to rule out an underlying hematologic malignancy. If the bone marrow biopsy is negative, further imaging studies, such as a colonoscopy or upper endoscopy, may be necessary to evaluate for an underlying inflammatory bowel disease.

Title: Urticaria 12 Days After COVID-19 mRNA Booster Vaccination Case is: A healthy 27-year-old woman received a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine (Moderna) on December 7, 2021. She had not experienced adverse effects after the first 2 vaccine doses on January 17 and February 5, 2021. Twelve days after the booster vaccination, she developed pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling. Over the next week, a pruritic rash spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms; each lesion faded without scarring within 24 hours. She did not experience lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. Application of pressure to her forearm in a circular motion using a pen cap elicited wheal and flare lesions (Figure, left panel). On physical examination, performed 17 days after the onset of rash, her vital signs were normal. She had no tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Wheal and flare lesions developed on her upper eyelids during the examination and resolved after approximately 30 minutes (Figure, right panel). Light pressure applied to her skin with a tongue depressor elicited wheal and flare lesions within 3 to 5 minutes.Wheal and flare lesions on patient’s forearm (left) and eyelids (right).The patient had no history of atopy, urticaria, angioedema, or food or drug allergy and no recent infections.

The patient presented with urticaria 12 days after receiving a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. Urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by wheals (raised, red, itchy bumps) and angioedema (swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, or eyes). The patient's symptoms were consistent with an allergic reaction to the vaccine.

The patient had no history of atopy, urticaria, angioedema, or food or drug allergy and no recent infections. She took no prescription medications and reported no recent use of over-the-counter medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She had no recent travel, exposure to animals, or use of new personal care products.

The patient's symptoms were mild and resolved spontaneously within 24 hours. She did not experience any other symptoms, such as lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings were consistent with an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The patient was advised to avoid future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. She was also prescribed a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and referred for allergy testing.

Reasoning:
The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings were consistent with an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The patient had no history of atopy, urticaria, angioedema, or food or drug allergy and no recent infections. She took no prescription medications and reported no recent use of over-the-counter medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She had no recent travel, exposure to animals, or use of new personal care products. The patient's symptoms were mild and resolved spontaneously within 24 hours. She did not experience any other symptoms, such as lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations.

The patient was advised to avoid future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. She was also prescribed a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and referred for allergy testing. This is because the patient is at risk for a more severe allergic reaction if she is vaccinated again. The epinephrine autoinjector will be used to treat anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. Allergy testing will help to determine the specific allergen that caused the patient's reaction so that she can avoid it in the future.

Title: Painful Neck Lump in a Patient 10 Years After Parotidectomy Case is: A 63-year-old man presented with a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. His histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes.He presented to the ear, nose, and throat clinic and complained of pain in the operative site of 6 months duration. This occurred intermittently once a week and lasted for a few minutes each time. It was associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain was worse on touch and head turning. On examination, there was a 3-mm nodularity palpated deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. It was associated with focal tenderness. His facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient was counseled for an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor. His histology results showed a 5-cm Warthin tumor, with a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes.

His facial nerve function was otherwise normal, and sensation in the ear lobe was intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, and the results showed no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient was counseled for an excisional biopsy of the left neck nodule. The intraoperative photograph of the neck and the excised specimen is shown in Figure 1.

The most likely diagnosis is **reactive lymphoid hyperplasia**. This is a common finding in patients who have undergone previous surgery in the neck. The hyperplasia is a response to inflammation and irritation, and it is usually self-limited. In some cases, however, it can persist and cause symptoms such as pain and tenderness.

The other possible diagnoses are **greater auricular nerve neuroma**, **recurrent parotid tumor**, and **metastatic tumor deposit**. Greater auricular nerve neuromas are rare tumors that arise from the greater auricular nerve. They can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the ear and neck. Recurrent parotid tumors are tumors that have come back after being treated with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Metastatic tumor deposits are tumors that have spread from another part of the body to the neck.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. The MRI scan showed no evidence of a tumor, and the patient's facial nerve function was normal. An excisional biopsy of the neck nodule showed that it was composed of reactive lymphoid tissue.

Title: Large Subconjunctival Mass in a Patient With a History of Multiple Previous Ocular Surgeries Case is: A 20-year-old woman presented with complaints of blurred vision in her left eye over several weeks and a growing, bulging left-eye mass. Her history was notable for bilateral colobomas involving the iris, optic nerve, and retina; congenital cataracts after lensectomy of the left eye; retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy of the left eye requiring a scleral buckle and silicone oil; and intractable glaucoma in the left eye requiring a superior trabeculectomy, an inferotemporal Ahmed tube implant, and multiple diode cyclophotocoagulation treatments. Because of the high risk of retinal redetachment, the silicone oil was retained throughout the glaucoma procedures. The patient presented 9 months after the last cyclophotocoagulation procedure.At presentation, she was taking dorzolamide-timolol, brimonidine, netarsudil, and latanoprost for her left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Examination of the left eye revealed a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve (Figure 1). There was a left hypertropia of more than 45° by Hirschberg test. The anterior chamber was deep with fine silicone oil bubbles superiorly. The aphakic left eye revealed a well-positioned tube. Cup-disc ratios were 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. The retina was centrally attached under silicone oil with a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment.Preoperative appearance of a subconjunctival mass of the left eye after inferior temporal Ahmed valve surgery.Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valveWhat Would You Do Next? A: Bleb revision with excision of the mass , B: Fine-needle aspiration of the mass , C: Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity , D: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve. This mass is likely a bleb granuloma, which is a benign mass that can form at the site of a glaucoma drainage device (GDD). Bleb granulomas are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, redness, and swelling. In some cases, they can also cause vision problems.

The treatment of bleb granulomas depends on the size and symptoms of the mass. Small, asymptomatic bleb granulomas can often be managed with observation. Larger or symptomatic bleb granulomas may need to be treated with surgical excision.

In this case, the patient has a large, symptomatic bleb granuloma. The best course of treatment is to perform a bleb revision with excision of the mass. This procedure will involve making an incision in the conjunctiva and removing the bleb granuloma. The Ahmed valve will also be removed at this time.

Title: Papilledema in an Adolescent With Anemia and Leukopenia Case is: A 12-year-old girl with an unremarkable medical and ocular history was admitted for workup of anemia (hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and leukopenia (white blood cell count, 1220 cells/μL; to convert to ×109 cells per liter, multiply by 0.001) with associated symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever. Inflammatory markers were elevated with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 130 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 1.48 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10). The patient noted floaters in her right eye, which prompted an ophthalmology consultation. On bedside examination, her near visual acuity was J1+ (Snellen equivalent, 20/20 OU), and color vision was full in both eyes; the patient’s intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, and confrontational visual fields were all unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed grade I and II optic disc edema in the right and left eyes, respectively, and peripapillary hemorrhage in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography was obtained 3 days after initial consultation, which confirmed bilateral disc edema, more pronounced in the left eye than the right eye (Figure 1), and 24-2 Humphrey visual field examination in both eyes was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture were obtained, and results showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment and findings suggestive of papilledema. Magnetic resonance venography did not reveal thrombosis. Opening pressure during lumbar puncture was 37 cm H2O (upper limit of normal, 28 cm H2O); all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. CSF protein was slightly decreased at 10.4 mg/dL, and CSF cytospin findings were unremarkable.Optical coherence tomography of the right (A) and left (B) optic discs showing edema (mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, 158 μm and 187 μm in the right and left eye, respectively).What Would You Do Next? A: Repeat serial ophthalmic examinations , B: Diagnose and treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension , C: Perform bone marrow biopsy , D: Repeat serial lumbar punctures. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has anemia, leukopenia, and papilledema. Anemia and leukopenia are both signs of bone marrow disease. Papiledema is a sign of increased intracranial pressure. The patient's MRI showed diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment, which is consistent with a bone marrow disease. The lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 37 cm H2O, which is elevated. All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral serology test results were negative, and glucose level and red and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. CSF protein was slightly decreased at 10.4 mg/dL, and CSF cytospin findings were unremarkable. These findings are consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Answer:
The correct answer is C. Perform bone marrow biopsy.

A bone marrow biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing bone marrow disease. It is a procedure in which a small sample of bone marrow is taken from the patient's hip bone. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. A bone marrow biopsy can help to determine the cause of the patient's anemia and leukopenia. It can also help to determine the stage of the patient's disease.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Repeating serial ophthalmic examinations would not provide any additional information. Diagnosing and treating IIH would not address the underlying cause of the patient's anemia and leukopenia. Repeating serial lumbar punctures would not be helpful, as the patient's CSF findings are already normal.

Title: Ptosis With Fluctuating Diplopia Case is: A patient in their 60s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis. The patient underwent right-sided ptosis repair at another hospital less than 1 year earlier without improvement. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU, and pupil examination revealed no anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect. Color vision was full in both eyes. External examination revealed a margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) of 0 mm OD, 4 mm OS without fatigability in extended upgaze (Figure 1A). The patient had a small exotropia in primary gaze with a −2 supraduction deficit. No proptosis was observed. An ice pack was applied in the clinic to the ptotic eyelid for 2 minutes, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement (Figure 1B) in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus. The patient reported no associated headache, weakness, or difficulty swallowing.External photographs demonstrate ptosis of the right upper eyelid with a margin reflex distance 1 of 0 mm (A) that improved by 1.5 mm after application of an ice pack for 2 minutes (B).Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbitWhat Would You Do Next? A: Serum testing for autoantibodies , B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit , C: Revision ptosis repair , D: Begin symptomatic management with cholinesterase inhibitor. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles. The ptosis and diplopia are likely due to weakness of the extraocular muscles. The ice pack test is a positive test for myasthenia gravis, as it results in improvement of the ptosis and diplopia. The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit to look for evidence of thymoma, a tumor that is associated with myasthenia gravis. If the MRI is negative, then serum testing for autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptors can be done to confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. If the diagnosis is confirmed, then treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor, such as pyridostigmine, can be started.

Title: Unilateral Yellowish Eye in a Woman With an Intraocular Mass Case is: A 65-year-old woman was referred with a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use.On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia (Figure 1A). On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot (Figure 1B). In the interim, she received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.Coloration changes in the left eye associated with choroidal hemorrhage and an intraocular solid lesion.

In the interim, she received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.

The most likely diagnosis is choroidal melanoma. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. Choroidal melanoma is a rare malignancy that accounts for approximately 5% of all melanomas. It is typically diagnosed in patients over the age of 50, and there is a slight female predominance. The most common presenting symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include floaters, pain, and redness in the eye. On examination, a choroidal melanoma typically appears as a dark, elevated mass in the back of the eye. Imaging studies such as B-scan ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging can help to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the tumor.

The treatment of choroidal melanoma depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. Small tumors that are not associated with vision loss may be treated with observation alone. Larger tumors or tumors that are causing vision loss may be treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. The goal of treatment is to control the tumor and preserve vision.

In this case, the patient is a good candidate for plaque brachytherapy. Plaque brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat choroidal melanoma. It involves placing a radioactive plaque directly on the surface of the tumor. The plaque delivers a high dose of radiation to the tumor, while minimizing the dose to the surrounding healthy tissue. Plaque brachytherapy is a safe and effective treatment for choroidal melanoma. It can control the tumor and preserve vision in most cases.

Title: An Intramedullary Enigma Case is: A woman in her 60s was diagnosed with high-grade leiomyosarcoma of the uterus in 2017 for which she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In 2020, she relapsed in the liver and spine. In November 2020, she underwent posterior lateral stabilization of C7-T4 for a T2 vertebral body metastasis causing cord compression, followed by postoperative stereotactic body radiation therapy to T2 to T3 (35 Gy/5 fractions) in January 2021. In February 2021, she received palliative radiation therapy (20 Gy/5 fractions) to T9 to T12 for a T11 vertebral body metastasis with epidural extension. From January to August 2021, she was treated with gemcitabine, and in September 2021, she received her first dose of liposomal doxorubicin. Two weeks later, she developed progressive bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance, prompting emergent evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings demonstrated extensive spinal cord edema extending from T2 to the conus and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion at T9 to T10 without any mass effect (Figure 1). Because the intramedullary lesion appeared atypical for malignant disease given the lack of mass effect, she was prescribed high-dose steroids while further workup was pursued. Lumbar puncture showed no malignant cells. Positron emission tomographic-computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan demonstrated multifocal intensely F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease, but only mild uptake from T9 to T12 and no definitive FDG-avidity at the intramedullary lesion. Her symptoms remained stable with steroid treatment and a plan was made to repeat an MRI of the spine in 6 to 8 weeks.A, T1-weighted postgadolinium sagittal image demonstrating an enhancing spinal intramedullary lesion (blue arrowhead).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and imaging findings are most consistent with spinal cord infarct. She has a history of metastatic leiomyosarcoma that has been treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. She developed progressive bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance two weeks after receiving her first dose of liposomal doxorubicin. This is a typical presentation of spinal cord infarct. The MRI findings show extensive spinal cord edema extending from T2 to the conus and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion at T9 to T10 without any mass effect. This is also consistent with spinal cord infarct. Lumbar puncture showed no malignant cells, which further supports the diagnosis of spinal cord infarct. Positron emission tomographic-computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan demonstrated multifocal intensely F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease, but only mild uptake from T9 to T12 and no definitive FDG-avidity at the intramedullary lesion. This suggests that the intramedullary lesion is not malignant.

Title: A Mass in the Infratemporal Fossa Case is: A 51-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of headache, right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus. The patient reported that the facial and jaw symptoms had evolved gradually over the past 5 years and that multiple medical therapies had provided only minimal relief of pain. The patient’s medical history included anxiety, depression, emphysema, hyperlipidemia, migraines, and pseudoseizures. She denied prior head trauma and had no pertinent surgical history. On physical examination, the patient had normal body habitus and reported bilateral tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia of the right trigeminal nerve in the V2 and V3 distribution with intact masseteric nerve and symmetric facial nerve. Audiometric evaluation showed normal hearing bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic mass in the right side of infratemporal fossa (ITF) that was nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 (Figure 1A).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Encephalocele , B: Deep lobe parotid tumor , C: Trigeminal schwannoma , D: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's symptoms of headache, right-side jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus are consistent with a mass in the infratemporal fossa. The MRI findings of a cystic mass in the right side of the ITF that is nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 are also consistent with a mass in the infratemporal fossa. The most likely diagnosis is a trigeminal schwannoma, which is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that myelinate the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal schwannomas are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor in the head and neck, and they typically occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. The most common symptom of a trigeminal schwannoma is facial pain, which can be unilateral or bilateral. Other symptoms may include numbness, tingling, and weakness in the face. Trigeminal schwannomas can be diagnosed with a CT scan or MRI. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Reasoning:
The patient is a young man with a history of symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion and worsened in summer, and remitted in winter. He was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during past the 1.5 years. He attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. He had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands.

Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition. We took a skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand, and representative histopathologic features are shown in the figure.

Based on the history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma (AS). AS is a rare, acquired, and chronic skin disorder characterized by the development of small, white, papules on the acral surfaces of the hands and feet after water exposure. The papules are thought to be caused by dilatation of the eccrine sweat ducts, which can be seen on histopathologic examination. AS is typically a self-limiting condition, but it can be persistent and can cause significant cosmetic and functional impairment.

Title: Necrotic Plaques on the Ears of a Patient With COVID-19 Case is: A man in his 40s with a medical history of factor VII deficiency hemophilia presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Following admission, he was intubated with prone positioning, and treatment with tocilizumab and dexamethasone was started. He was also found to have Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia, and treatment with cefepime was initiated. Three days after admission, the patient developed erythema and edematous necrotic plaques of the bilateral ears (Figure, A and B). No devices had been used on the ears. The necrosis progressed during the following days, primarily involving the earlobe of the right ear and a large portion of the helix of the left ear. A punch biopsy specimen was performed (Figure, C and D).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Pressure necrosis , B: Levamisole-induced vasculitis , C: COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy) , D: Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

* Pressure necrosis is a type of skin damage that occurs when pressure is applied to an area of skin for a prolonged period of time. This can lead to the death of the skin cells in the affected area, and can eventually cause the skin to break down. However, the patient in this case did not have any devices used on his ears, which makes pressure necrosis less likely.
* Levamisole-induced vasculitis is a type of inflammation of the blood vessels that can be caused by the medication levamisole. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can cut off blood supply to the extremities, including the ears. However, the patient in this case was not taking levamisole, so this diagnosis is also less likely.
* COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy) is a condition that can occur in patients with COVID-19. It is characterized by inflammation and blood clots in the small blood vessels of the extremities, including the ears. This can lead to the death of the tissue in the affected area, and can eventually cause the skin to break down. This is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's history of COVID-19 and the appearance of the lesions on his ears.
* Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection that can occur in patients with severe underlying medical conditions, such as cancer or AIDS. It is characterized by the formation of necrotic ulcers on the skin. However, the patient in this case does not have any underlying medical conditions, so this diagnosis is less likely.

Title: A Woman With Painful Digital Ulcers Case is: A 66-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic hepatitis B treated with tenofovir presented to the emergency department for evaluation of digital erythema and painful finger ulcers, which developed 6 months prior but which had increased in number and become more painful in the past several weeks. She also reported dyspnea on exertion, which developed 6 months prior to presentation. On physical examination, her peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Auscultation of her lungs revealed crackles at the bases bilaterally. She had normal strength throughout all muscle groups and full range of motion in the joints of her hands. The palmar surfaces of her hands revealed livedo racemosa, erythema, and retiform purpura; ulcers overlying her phalangeal joint creases and fingertips; and scale and fissures on several digits (Figure). On the dorsal surfaces there was a large ulcer on the right second metacarpophalangeal joint and erythematous papules over several metacarpophalangeal joints. Ulcers were also noted on her elbows.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic hepatitis B treated with tenofovir. She presents with digital erythema and painful finger ulcers, which developed 6 months prior but which have increased in number and become more painful in the past several weeks. She also reports dyspnea on exertion, which developed 6 months prior to presentation. On physical examination, she has livedo racemosa, erythema, and retiform purpura on the palmar surfaces of her hands; ulcers overlying her phalangeal joint creases and fingertips; and scale and fissures on several digits. On the dorsal surfaces there is a large ulcer on the right second metacarpophalangeal joint and erythematous papules over several metacarpophalangeal joints. Ulcers are also noted on her elbows. Laboratory testing shows a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and normal creatine kinase level. The patient is admitted to the hospital for pain management and expedited workup of her progressive finger ulcerations.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes:

* Raynaud's phenomenon
* Scleroderma
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
* Dermatomyositis
* Polymyositis
* Mixed connective tissue disease
* Buerger's disease
* Thromboangiitis obliterans
* Infectious vasculitis
* Malignancy

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is systemic sclerosis (SSc), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and other organs. SSc is associated with a number of cutaneous manifestations, including Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, and sclerodactyly (thickening and tightening of the skin of the hands and fingers). Other systemic manifestations of SSc include dyspnea, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac disease, and renal disease.

The diagnosis of SSc is made based on clinical findings, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. Laboratory tests that may be helpful in the diagnosis of SSc include anti-centromere antibody, anti-topoisomerase I antibody, and anti-fibrillarin antibody. Imaging studies that may be helpful in the diagnosis of SSc include chest radiography, pulmonary function testing, and cardiac imaging.

There is no cure for SSc, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment options for SSc include medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

In this case, the patient's presentation is most consistent with SSc. The patient has a history of Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a common early manifestation of SSc. The patient also has digital ulcers, which are a characteristic finding of SSc. The patient's dyspnea on exertion is likely due to pulmonary hypertension, which is a common complication of SSc.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel. The chest CT scan will help to assess for the presence of pulmonary hypertension or other pulmonary complications of SSc. The myositis-specific autoantibody panel will help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis.

Title: Fever, Hypotension, and a Worsening Necrotic Wound Case is: On the day of giving birth via a normal vaginal delivery, a healthy woman in her 20s developed painful swelling on her right thigh, at the site of a methergine injection administered 1 day prior. Despite 3 days of treatment with an oral antibiotic (cefalexin), her thigh pain and swelling did not improve, and she was readmitted to the hospital and intravenous clindamycin was started. Wound cultures and blood cultures obtained during incision and drainage performed on hospital day 1 were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms. The following day, her temperature was 39.4 °C (102.9 °F), blood pressure was 86/42 mm Hg, and heart rate was 131/min. She was transferred to the intensive care unit for presumed septic shock, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem. Surgical debridement of the right thigh was performed on hospital day 3.On hospital day 4, a new purple dusky border developed along the wound edge, and the patent underwent a second surgical debridement. After debridement on hospital day 5, her temperature was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F), and she required vasopressor infusion with norepinephrine for shock. Her right thigh had a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge (Figure, left), with many 1- to 2-mm pustules (not visible in Figure). Laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation (Figure, right). Stains for microorganisms, and tissue and blood cultures, remained negative.Left, Patient’s right thigh showing characteristic violaceous border surrounding the surgical wound edge after multiple debridements.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a deep, necrotic wound with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge, and many 1- to 2-mm pustules. Laboratory testing shows a white blood cell count of 30 000/μL (88% neutrophils); lactate level, 77.5 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L); and procalcitonin level, 16.1 ng/mL (reference, <0.1 ng/mL). Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation. Stains for microorganisms, and tissue and blood cultures, remained negative.

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by a variety of bacteria, including group A streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacilli. The infection is characterized by rapid progression, extensive tissue necrosis, and a high mortality rate.

The initial management of necrotizing fasciitis is surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue. This is followed by antibiotics, supportive care, and, in some cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

In the patient described in the case, further surgical debridement is the most appropriate next step. The patient's wound is deep and necrotic, and the infection is progressing rapidly. Surgical debridement will help to remove all of the necrotic tissue and provide access to the infection for antibiotics.

Intravenous amphotericin B is not indicated for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that is used to treat systemic fungal infections. Necrotizing fasciitis is a bacterial infection, and amphotericin B is not effective against bacteria.

Start hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not indicated for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment that uses high-pressure oxygen to treat a variety of conditions, including necrotizing fasciitis. However, there is no evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is effective in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis.

Start intravenous glucocorticoids is not indicated for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Glucocorticoids are a type of steroid that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including inflammation. However, glucocorticoids can worsen the infection and increase the risk of death in patients with necrotizing fasciitis.

Title: Joint Pain in a Woman Wearing a Face Mask Case is: A 63-year-old woman with osteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnea treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) presented with several months of worsening pain in her hands (first metacarpophalangeal joints), wrists, and feet. Radiographs of the hands and wrists performed 1 month prior showed degenerative changes but no bone erosions. Her vital signs and physical examination findings were normal. She had no redness, warmth, or swelling of any joints, and her skin examination was unremarkable. However, a deformity of the nasal bridge was noted after she was asked to remove her face mask, which she was wearing as required during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure).

**Reasoning:** Based on the information given in the case, the patient is most likely suffering from Wegener's granulomatosis, a systemic vasculitis that can affect the kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Wegener's granulomatosis is characterized by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), which are antibodies that attack the body's own tissues. ANCAs can be detected in the blood by a test called an ANCA titer.

**Answer:** The correct answer is A. Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers.

Title: Orbital Inflammation in an Adult With Crohn Disease Case is: A man aged 57 years presented to the emergency department after 3 weeks of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling with associated headaches. He reported diplopia and pain with extraocular movement. There were no constitutional, dermatologic, or neurologic symptoms. The patient endorsed a history of Crohn disease, and his medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation.Clinical examination revealed bilateral periorbital edema, diplopia with decreased abduction in the right eye and decreased adduction in the left eye, chemosis, proptosis, and conjunctival hyperemia (Figure 1A). Visual acuity and neurologic and fundus examination findings were otherwise normal with no sign of optic neuropathy.Patient characteristics at initial presentation. A, External photograph reveals greater chemosis and more pronounced conjunctival hyperemia and eyelid edema of the right eye than of the left eye. B, Coronal computed tomography (CT) of the orbits. The yellow arrowhead indicates right lateral rectus muscle enlargement, and the blue arrowhead indicates left medial rectus muscle enlargement.Laboratory investigation showed a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate but was otherwise unremarkable. Levels of antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, IgG4 levels, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin receptor antibody were all normal. Orbital computed tomography showed moderate bilateral lateral rectus muscle enlargement and mild enlargement of the left medial rectus muscle (Figure 1B) with mild, homogenous enhancement.Prednisone was started at a dose of 60 mg daily, and the patient’s symptoms resolved; however, eye pain immediately recurred when weaning the prednisone. An orbitotomy with lateral rectus biopsy was performed, which showed a prominent chronic inflammatory process with infiltrates composed of a mixture of epithelioid histiocytes and small-sized lymphocytes associated with severe muscle atrophy. Prednisone was restarted.Perform further imaging to exclude a solid-organ primary malignancyPerform further thyroid function tests and thyroid imagingWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The patient in this case has a history of Crohn disease and has been experiencing periorbital pain, swelling, and diplopia for 3 weeks. The patient's symptoms have improved with prednisone therapy, but have recurred when the prednisone dose was reduced. An orbitotomy with lateral rectus biopsy showed a prominent chronic inflammatory process. Based on this information, the next step in management should be to perform further imaging to exclude a solid-organ primary malignancy.

Reasoning:

The patient's presentation is concerning for orbital inflammatory disease, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, and Wegener granulomatosis. In this case, the patient has a history of Crohn disease, and the biopsy showed a prominent chronic inflammatory process. These findings are consistent with orbital inflammatory disease secondary to Crohn disease. However, it is important to exclude other possible causes of orbital inflammatory disease, such as a solid-organ primary malignancy.

Imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, can be used to evaluate the orbits and other structures in the head and neck for evidence of a malignancy. If a malignancy is found, the patient will need to be treated with appropriate chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

If imaging studies do not show evidence of a malignancy, the patient can be treated with prednisone therapy. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to suppress inflammation. The patient's symptoms should improve with prednisone therapy, but the patient may need to take prednisone long-term to maintain control of the inflammation.

In some cases, patients with orbital inflammatory disease may need to have surgery to remove inflamed tissue or to repair damage to the eye muscles. Surgery is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy or who have severe complications of orbital inflammatory disease.

Title: Multifocal Macular Lesions in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 49-year-old African American woman with no significant medical history came to the clinic because of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging.Computed tomographic scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvisWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 49-year-old African American woman with no significant medical history who presents with abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS. An anterior segment examination is normal. Dilated fundus examination reveals multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally (Figure 1). Fluorescein angiography revealed staining of these lesions with a pseudohypopyon appearance of the central vitelliform lesion in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space. No evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane was present on examination or imaging.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's findings includes idiopathic AEPVM, paraneoplastic AEPVM, and other causes of vitelliform maculopathy, such as Best disease and Stargardt disease. Idiopathic AEPVM is a self-limited condition that typically resolves within 6-12 months. Paraneoplastic AEPVM is a rare condition that is associated with underlying malignancy. Best disease and Stargardt disease are inherited retinal diseases that typically present in childhood or adolescence.

The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with idiopathic AEPVM. However, the possibility of paraneoplastic AEPVM should be considered, given the patient's age and the absence of a family history of retinal diseases. A computed tomographic scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT SCAN) is the most appropriate test to rule out malignancy in a patient with suspected paraneoplastic AEPVM.

Title: Worsening Angle Closure After Successful Laser Peripheral Iridotomy Case is: A White woman in her 40s was referred to an outside ophthalmologist after developing nausea and a headache following a dilated eye examination. She was found to have narrow angles in both eyes and a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) was performed in her left eye. Two weeks later she developed flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of her vision in her left eye. Her vision had decreased in her left eye and macular and optic nerve edema were noted and she was subsequently referred to us. In our clinic, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and she had normal intraocular pressure, a shallow anterior chamber but open angle in both eyes, a patent LPI in the left eye, and clear crystalline lenses in both eyes. The rest of her anterior segment was unremarkable. The posterior examination was notable for shifting subretinal fluid with choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema and leopard spotting, while her right eye was unremarkable (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing, while optical coherence tomography showed shallow subretinal fluid and an irregular and thickened choroid (Figure, B). Ultrasonography showed an axial length of 20.0 mm, thickened sclera, anteriorly rotated ciliary body, and 360° of ciliochoroidal detachments in both eyes but worse in the left eye. Results of a systemic laboratory evaluation for infectious and noninfectious disorders were unremarkable. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid and her vision declined.Subretinal fluid and choroidal effusions following a laser peripheral iridotomy.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of angle closure glaucoma in both eyes, with a successful LPI performed in the left eye two weeks prior to presentation. She now presents with worsening vision in the left eye, with findings of subretinal fluid and choroidal detachments on fundus examination and OCT. These findings are consistent with a choroidal effusion syndrome, which can occur following LPI. In this condition, the LPI allows for the release of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the subretinal space, leading to choroidal detachment and subretinal fluid. This can result in vision loss if left untreated.

The treatment for choroidal effusion syndrome is typically a clear lens exchange (CLE). In this procedure, the clear crystalline lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens. This allows for the drainage of aqueous humor from the subretinal space and resolution of the choroidal detachment and subretinal fluid.

Title: Diagnostic Dilemmas With a Great Ocular Masquerader Case is: A white man in his early 80s with history of autoimmune pancreatitis, recurrent colon polyps, and benign prostatic hyperplasia developed rapid, painless vision loss of both eyes over a 2-week period 6 months after cataract surgery. Vision was 20/250 OD and 20/60 OS. The anterior segment was unremarkable in either eye, while the posterior segment examination noted 1+ vitreous cell, asteroid hyalosis, and a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment (RD) in the right eye and trace vitreous cell and a multilobulated, serous RD in the left eye. Imaging included B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence, which revealed diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes (Figure 1). No poliosis or skin changes were noted. A review of systems was unremarkable, most notably a lack of any pulmonary symptoms. A focused laboratory evaluation identified a significantly elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer, but serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing had negative results. To better differentiate between Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis as the underlying cause of the vitreous inflammation and multilobulated, serous RD in both eyes, a computed tomographic scan was performed. It showed marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. The institute’s radiologists believed these computed tomography findings were nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma.Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome–like presentation of multilobulated pockets of subretinal fluid and choroidal thickening and undulations.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient presents with a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment in both eyes. The differential diagnosis for this includes Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), sarcoidosis, and intraocular lymphoma. VKH is a systemic autoimmune disorder that can affect the eyes, skin, and central nervous system. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs, eyes, skin, and other organs. Intraocular lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the eye.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with VKH. He has a history of autoimmune pancreatitis, which is a condition that can be associated with VKH. He also has a history of recurrent colon polyps, which can be associated with an increased risk of cancer. The patient's vision loss is rapid and painless, which is also consistent with VKH.

The patient's imaging studies are also consistent with VKH. The B-scan, optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence studies all show diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence in both eyes. These findings are classic for VKH.

The patient's laboratory tests are also consistent with VKH. The elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and antinuclear antibody titer are both non-specific findings that can be seen in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including VKH. The negative serum lysozyme, syphilis, and tuberculosis testing help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's vision loss.

The patient's computed tomography scan shows marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes. These findings are nonspecific and could be indicative of either sarcoidosis or intraocular lymphoma.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests, the most likely diagnosis is VKH. The next step in the patient's management should be to treat him with systemic steroids. Systemic steroids are the mainstay of treatment for VKH and have been shown to be effective in improving vision and preventing complications.

Title: Bilateral Linear Oral Ulcerations and Facial Swelling in a Young Woman Case is: A 32-year-old woman was referred by her dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of persistent bilateral cheek swelling and mouth pain. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had awoken with bilateral linear “gashes” in her mandibular vestibule that were accompanied by bilateral buccal facial swellings. Since that day, the facial swelling remained unchanged, and although the mucosal lesions healed, the oral pain persisted. The patient’s medical history was noteworthy for depression, for which she was taking bupropion and fluoxetine, and prior alcohol use disorder, for which she was 3 years sober. She denied any smokeless tobacco use but endorsed daily electronic cigarette use.The extraoral examination detected bilateral buccal facial swelling of the lower facial third without associated trismus or lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). Intraorally, bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule was noted with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations were also present on the right buccal mucosa (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion was performed, and the specimen showed diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was observed (Figure, C). Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative.Clinical and histologic features of a patient with oral ulceration and facial swelling. A, Clinical examination shows bilateral buccal swelling.

Acid-fast bacilli staining was negative.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Mumps (epidemic parotitis) , B: Alcoholic sialosis , C: Sjogren disease , D: Crohn disease. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of depression and alcohol use disorder. She presents with bilateral linear oral ulcerations and facial swelling. The facial swelling is bilateral and non-tender, without associated lymphadenopathy. There is no trismus. Intraorally, there is bilateral scarring of the mandibular buccal vestibule with focal areas of ulceration. Small aphthous ulcerations are also present on the right buccal mucosa. An incisional biopsy of the right vestibular lesion shows diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates within the lamina propria. On higher magnification, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation is observed. Staining for acid-fast bacilli is negative.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes mumps (epidemic parotitis), alcoholic sialosis, Sjogren disease, and Crohn disease. Mumps is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the parotid glands, which are located in the front of the cheeks. Symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, and swelling of the parotid glands. Mumps is typically a self-limiting illness, but it can be serious in rare cases.

Alcoholic sialosis is a condition that occurs as a result of chronic alcohol abuse. It is characterized by enlargement of the salivary glands, which can lead to facial swelling. Symptoms of alcoholic sialosis include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, and pain in the salivary glands.

Sjogren disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva. Symptoms of Sjogren disease include dry eyes, dry mouth, and joint pain. Sjogren disease can also cause inflammation of other organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, and liver.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of Crohn disease include abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. Crohn disease can also cause inflammation of other organs, such as the eyes, skin, and joints.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Sjogren disease. This is because the patient has bilateral linear oral ulcerations and facial swelling, which are classic symptoms of Sjogren disease. The patient also has a history of depression and alcohol use disorder, which are risk factors for Sjogren disease. The biopsy results also support the diagnosis of Sjogren disease, as they show noncaseating granulomatous inflammation.

Title: An Unexplained Lost Voice Case is: A 64-year-old man presented to the otolaryngology clinic with hoarseness of voice for 3 weeks associated with intermittent dry cough. He had no medical history or family history of cancer and was not a smoker. In the absence of other suggestive symptoms, as well as a normal physical examination that did not reveal any enlarged cervical lymph nodes or oropharyngeal or neck mass and an unremarkable nasoendoscopic examination, a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made. The patient was advised to try conservative management with dietary advice and proton pump inhibitors, and a clinical review was scheduled in 6 weeks. The patient only returned 3 months later when his hoarseness became worse. Repeat nasoendoscopy now showed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. In the absence of a history of trauma and associated neurological or systemic symptoms, the main concern was an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve at various points or its recurrent branch. Results of a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass, which was likely nodal disease, at the left supraclavicular (Figure 1), as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encased the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This was along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounted for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remained unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer was then performed.Coronal view of the computed tomographic scan of the patient’s neck, including the left supraclavicular node (yellow arrowhead) and the left common carotid artery (black arrowhead).What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a 3-week history of hoarseness associated with an intermittent dry cough. He has no medical history or family history of cancer and is not a smoker. His physical examination is unremarkable, and a nasoendoscopic examination shows left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. A CT scan shows an ill-defined soft tissue mass at the left supraclavicular fossa, as well as the prevertebral and paravertebral region, which partially encases the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This is along the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounts for the left vocal cord palsy. However, the primary site of disease remains unclear. A fused positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer shows increased uptake in the left supraclavicular fossa, consistent with metastatic disease.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic colon cancer. This is because the patient is a man of the right age and has a history of intermittent dry cough, which is a common symptom of colon cancer. The CT scan shows an ill-defined soft tissue mass at the left supraclavicular fossa, which is a common site of metastasis for colon cancer. The PET/CT scan shows increased uptake in the left supraclavicular fossa, which is also a common finding in metastatic colon cancer.

Other possible diagnoses include lymphoma, esophageal cancer, and laryngeal cancer. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

**Reasoning:**
The patient presents with a history of asymptomatic keratotic papules that first appeared on the left middle and ring fingers and left toe web spaces more than 10 years earlier. The papules progressed proximally over the subsequent decade to involve the forearm, arm, scapular area, ankle, shin, and thigh, but only affected the left side of the body. The patient’s face, palms, soles, and entire right side of the body were spared. The patient has a history of rosacea being treated with topical metronidazole gel for flares but was otherwise asymptomatic. The patient did not have any alopecia, night blindness, or dry eyes or skin. There was no history of any exposure to radiation or arsenic, nutritional deficiency, inflammatory skin disease, or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of a similar condition.

On examination, the patient was found to have multiple, submillimeter, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections over the aforementioned areas, only on the left side of the body. Punch biopsy from a lesion showed orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis was mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There was a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles were unaffected.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes lichen spinulosus, multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, porokeratosis, and viral warts.

Lichen spinulosus is a chronic, papular dermatosis characterized by small, spiny papules on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Histologically, lichen spinulosus is characterized by a parakeratotic column overlying a mildly acanthotic epidermis with a normal granular layer and keratinocyte maturation. A sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate is also present.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by multiple, small, digitate projections on the palms and soles. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Histologically, multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is characterized by orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination. The epidermis is mildly acanthotic and with a normal granular layer. There is a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Adjacent hair follicles are unaffected.

Porokeratosis is a group of rare, chronic skin disorders characterized by hyperkeratosis with a central crater or cup-shaped depression. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Histologically, porokeratosis is characterized by a parakeratotic column overlying a thinned epidermis with a lack of granular layer and keratinocyte maturation. A perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate is also present.

Viral warts are common, benign skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Histologically, viral warts are characterized by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis. A perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate is also present.

In this case, the patient's history, clinical presentation, and histopathology are most consistent with a diagnosis of multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis. The patient's lesions are asymptomatic, are located on the palms and soles, and have a characteristic histopathologic appearance. Lichen spinulosus and porokeratosis are also in the differential diagnosis, but these conditions are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation. Viral warts are also a possibility, but these lesions are usually more widespread and have a different histopathologic appearance.

The most likely diagnosis is nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (NMLE). NMLE is a rare, chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates in the skin. It is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in about 50% of cases. The clinical presentation of NMLE is variable, but it typically presents with a symmetrical eruption of erythematous papules and plaques on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions may be pruritic or painful, and they may sometimes ulcerate. Laboratory findings in NMLE may include leukocytosis, anemia, and hypocomplementemia. Autoimmune serology results may show positive antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-dsDNA antibodies, and anti-Smith antibodies. Histopathologic findings in NMLE show leukocytoclastic vasculitis and perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates in the dermis.

The treatment of NMLE is typically with oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Other treatment options may include topical steroids, dapsone, and azathioprine. The prognosis for NMLE is generally good, with most patients experiencing a complete or partial remission of their symptoms. However, some patients may have recurrent or chronic disease.

Title: A Young Woman With Viral Myocarditis Case is: A woman in her mid-20s presented with cardiogenic shock. On presentation, she was afebrile with cool extremities; her blood pressure was 75/51 mm Hg, heart rate was 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on mechanical ventilation. Her chest examination revealed bilateral coarse breath sounds and distant heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 10% with elevated filling pressures and no significant valvular abnormalities. Owing to hemodynamic instability, the patient was given venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with the peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP (Abiomed) and was administered high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic viral myocarditis. There was significant hemodynamic improvement within 48 hours; transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained and showed impressive recovery of the left ventricular function to an ejection fraction of 45%. As a result, ECMO was decannulated after 72 hours. Left pVAD support was maintained alone for another 24 hours. In the interim, her vitals remained unchanged, but the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, and low-flow alarms sounded on the device console. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed to evaluate pVAD positioning (Figure and Video).Transesophageal echocardiogram after low-flow alarm on peripheral ventricular assist device console.

Title: Macular Fluid in a Patient With a Reported History of Normal-Tension Glaucoma Case is: A patient with a history of normal-tension glaucoma presented with a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye. Examination showed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 OD, 20/30 OS, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg OU. In the right eye, dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula revealed subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces within the outer nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer in the nasal macula (Figure 1). Results of the left eye fundus examination and macular OCT were normal. In both eyes, the optic cup appeared very deep with a large cup-disc ratio.Color fundus photograph (A) and optical coherence tomography of the macula (B) illustrating intraretinal and subretinal fluid at the nasal macula. The white line indicates the position of the optical coherence tomography scan.Five years prior to presentation, the patient started treatment with latanoprost nightly in both eyes for an enlarged cup-disc ratio presumed due to normal-tension glaucoma. At that time, intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS and central corneal thickness was normal. Visual field and OCT of the retinal nerve fiber layer were without reproducible defects over 5 years of follow-up. The patient denied a family history of eye disease.What Would You Do Next? A: Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor , B: Fluorescein angiography , C: OCT of the optic nerve head , D: OCT-angiography of the macula. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The patient has a history of normal-tension glaucoma, which is a type of glaucoma that occurs even though the intraocular pressure (IOP) is normal. Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve, which is responsible for carrying visual information from the eye to the brain. Damage to the optic nerve can lead to vision loss.

The patient's current symptoms include a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye. This is a common symptom of macular edema, which is swelling of the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. Macular edema can be caused by a number of conditions, including glaucoma, diabetes, and retinal vein occlusion.

The patient's examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 OD, 20/30 OS, and intraocular pressure of 13 mm Hg OU. In the right eye, dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula revealed subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces within the outer nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer in the nasal macula. Results of the left eye fundus examination and macular OCT were normal. In both eyes, the optic cup appeared very deep with a large cup-disc ratio.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with macular edema secondary to glaucoma. The next step in management is to start treatment with a medication that can lower IOP and reduce the risk of further vision loss. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are a common treatment for macular edema. Anti-VEGF medications work by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which can contribute to macular edema.

In addition to starting treatment with anti-VEGF injections, the patient should also be monitored closely for progression of the glaucoma. This may include regular follow-up visits with an ophthalmologist, as well as monitoring of the patient's visual fields and OCT scans.

The patient's case highlights the importance of early detection and treatment of glaucoma. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to irreversible vision loss. However, with early diagnosis and treatment, glaucoma can be effectively managed and vision loss can be prevented.

**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of normal-tension glaucoma and is currently experiencing blurred vision in the right eye. This is consistent with macular edema, which is swelling of the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision.

Title: Bilateral Hemorrhagic Optic Disc Edema in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A 49-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, intravenous drug abuse, and multiple sexual partners presented to the emergency department with painless vision loss in both eyes for 10 days, left eye worse than right eye, and photophobia in both eyes. His visual acuity was count fingers OD and 20/70 OS. Intraocular pressure was 20 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. There were 1+ (10-12 cells/high-power field) anterior chamber cells in both eyes with very hazy posterior pole details in the right eye and minimal vitreous haze in the left eye. There was a hazy view to the posterior pole in the right eye with disc edema and multiple flame hemorrhages surrounding the nerve. Examination of the posterior pole in the left eye revealed partial obstruction of all vessels and a complete halo on the disc with numerous flame hemorrhages emanating from and surrounding the optic nerve, along with a few dot blot hemorrhages within the macula (Figure). His blood pressure was 173/137 mm Hg, but the rest of his vital signs were normal.Widefield color image of the left eye of a 49-year-old man with acute loss of vision. There is marked hemorrhagic disc edema with flame hemorrhages emanating from and surrounding the optic nerve.What Would You Do Next? A: Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results , B: Administer 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone , C: Inject intravitreal foscarnet , D: Obtain computed tomographic scan of the brain. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **A. Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results.**

The patient's history and examination findings are highly suggestive of an infectious cause of his vision loss, such as HIV-associated retinopathy or syphilis-associated uveitis. These conditions can cause inflammation of the optic nerve, which can lead to visual loss. Obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results is the next step in the evaluation of this patient.

HIV-associated retinopathy is a common cause of vision loss in patients with HIV. It is caused by infection of the retinal cells by the HIV virus. The infection can cause inflammation, which can lead to swelling of the optic nerve and visual loss.

Syphilis-associated uveitis is a less common cause of vision loss in patients with syphilis. It is caused by infection of the uveal tract, which is the middle layer of the eye. The infection can cause inflammation, which can lead to swelling of the optic nerve and visual loss.

Obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results will help to determine the cause of the patient's vision loss. If the results are positive, the patient will need to be treated for the underlying infection. Treatment of HIV-associated retinopathy and syphilis-associated uveitis can help to preserve vision.

Reasoning:

* The patient's history and examination findings are highly suggestive of an infectious cause of his vision loss, such as HIV-associated retinopathy or syphilis-associated uveitis.
* HIV-associated retinopathy and syphilis-associated uveitis can cause inflammation of the optic nerve, which can lead to visual loss.
* Obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results is the next step in the evaluation of this patient.

Title: Decreased Vision and Eye Pain in a 55-Year-Old Man Case is: A 55-year-old man with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain. He had undergone trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection 1 month prior. On initial examination, his visual acuity was 20/25. He had diffuse conjunctival hyperemia without bleb purulence or leakage and more than 50 cells per high-power field of a 1 × 1-mm area of light on slitlamp biomicroscopy. He was treated for blebitis with topical fortified antibiotics but subsequently developed vitritis. He underwent vitreous tap and injection of vancomycin and amikacin followed by pars plana vitrectomy with bleb revision. Separate vitreous samples from each procedure were sent for Gram stain and bacterial and fungal culture on chocolate and Sabouraud agar with no growth. His eye pain worsened significantly, and ultrasound biomicroscopy showed scleral thickening (Figure 1A). Lab workup for autoimmune scleritis including tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. He was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. His vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque (Figure 1B).A, Episcleral and scleral thickening (yellow brackets) adjacent to normal tissue (white brackets) on ultrasound biomicroscopy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 55-year-old man with advanced primary open-angle glaucoma who presented with 1 day of decreased vision and eye pain.

He was admitted to the hospital and started intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. His vision continued to decline to counting fingers because of the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque.

The most likely diagnosis is endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the inner eye. The patient's history of trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection puts him at increased risk for endophthalmitis. The clinical presentation of endophthalmitis includes decreased vision, eye pain, redness, and floaters. The diagnosis is confirmed by vitreous tap and culture. The initial treatment for endophthalmitis is intravenous antibiotics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected material from the eye.

In this case, the patient has already been treated with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. However, his vision has continued to decline. The next step in management is to repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling to rule out a resistant organism. If the cultures are negative, the patient can be treated with a prolonged course of oral antibiotics. If the cultures are positive, the patient should be treated with intravenous antibiotics that are active against the infecting organism.

Title: A Perplexing Pediatric Parotid Mass Case is: A previously healthy 8-year-old boy presented to an outpatient clinic for further evaluation of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years. The patient was not immunocompromised and denied any trauma to the area. In the 2 months prior, he had received multiple rounds of antibiotics from other health care professionals. Outside computed tomography of the face showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy. An outside health care professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures. The patient presented to our clinic with an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland. There was no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and facial nerve function remained fully intact. The patient denied fevers or systemic symptoms. Results of laboratory evaluation revealed normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels with negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB). Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland (Figure 1).The T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, and fat-suppressed axial (A) and coronal (B) magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrate the enhancing right-sided lesions overlying the distal aspect of the parotid and extending deep into the parotid parenchyma.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Branchial cleft cyst , B: Atypical mycobacterium infection , C: Chronic sialadenitis with abscess , D: Venolymphatic malformation. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient is a previously healthy 8-year-old boy with a 3-year history of a fluctuating right parotid mass. The mass is fluctuant and tender, and there is no associated lymphadenopathy. The patient has a normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland.

The differential diagnosis for a parotid mass includes:

* Branchial cleft cyst: This is a congenital anomaly that occurs when the branchial arches fail to fuse properly. Branchial cleft cysts are typically located in the anterior neck, but they can also occur in the parotid gland. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can become infected or cause obstruction of the parotid duct.
* Atypical mycobacterium infection: This is an infection caused by atypical mycobacteria, which are a group of bacteria that are not typically associated with human disease. Atypical mycobacterial infections can occur in the lungs, skin, and other organs, including the parotid gland. They are more common in immunocompromised patients, but they can also occur in healthy individuals.
* Chronic sialadenitis with abscess: This is a condition that occurs when the parotid gland becomes inflamed and infected. It is more common in older adults, but it can also occur in children. Chronic sialadenitis with abscess can cause pain, swelling, and tenderness in the parotid gland.
* Venolymphatic malformation: This is a congenital anomaly that occurs when the veins and lymphatic vessels do not develop properly. Venolymphatic malformations are typically located in the head and neck, but they can also occur in other parts of the body. They can cause swelling, pain, and disfigurement.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is chronic sialadenitis with abscess. This is supported by the patient's history of a fluctuating parotid mass, the presence of a fluctuant and tender mass on examination, and the findings on magnetic resonance imaging. Atypical mycobacterial infection is a less likely diagnosis, as this condition is more common in immunocompromised patients. Branchial cleft cyst and venolymphatic malformation are also less likely diagnoses, as these conditions are typically not associated with a history of a fluctuating parotid mass.

When the arm was abducted to 90°, the patient denied pain but described a subtle tightness sensation on the arm. An excisional biopsy from the larger lesion was performed.

The histopathologic image shows dilated and thrombosed lymphatic vessels in subcutaneous tissue with recanalization. The immunohistochemistry finding was positive for D2-40 (podoplanin). These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of axillary web syndrome.

Axillary web syndrome is a rare condition that occurs after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). It is characterized by the development of a fibrous band or web in the axilla that can compress the lymphatic vessels and cause lymphedema. The condition is more common in patients who have undergone a modified radical mastectomy or a radical mastectomy.

The diagnosis of axillary web syndrome is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as an ultrasound or MRI, can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for axillary web syndrome is aimed at relieving the symptoms of lymphedema. This may include manual lymph drainage, compression therapy, and exercises to improve range of motion. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to release the web.

Title: Wide Complex QRS During Sotalol Administration Case is: A man in his 40s was seen in clinic for a long history of palpitations. He had a history of cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for sustained supraventricular tachycardia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient was also noted to have episodes of atrial flutter. Transthoracic echocardiogram displayed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% and mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in sinus rhythm showed mild left ventricle thickening (up to 14 mm) and was otherwise normal. The patient was hospitalized for initiation of sotalol, given that he experienced frequent episodes of atrial arrhythmia. Figure 1A shows sinus rhythm prior to sotalol initiation. Figure 1B shows telemetry during administration of sotalol.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for sustained supraventricular tachycardia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He also has episodes of atrial flutter. On telemetry during administration of sotalol, he has a wide complex QRS. This could be due to sotalol-induced torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia.

Answer:
The next step should be to discontinue sotalol and to monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of torsades de pointes. If the patient develops torsades de pointes, he should be treated with immediate cardioversion. If the patient does not develop torsades de pointes, he may be able to continue sotalol therapy with close monitoring.

Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring would not be helpful in this case, as it would not be able to detect torsades de pointes that occur only transiently. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient's arrhythmia is not due to a reentrant circuit. Emergency coronary angiogram would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient does not have any evidence of coronary artery disease. Exercise treadmill test would not be helpful in this case, as it would not be able to detect torsades de pointes.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
The correct answer is: A. Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring.

Reasoning:

The patient in this case has a history of cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for sustained supraventricular tachycardia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He is also noted to have episodes of atrial flutter. The patient was hospitalized for initiation of sotalol, given that he experienced frequent episodes of atrial arrhythmia.

Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is used to treat a variety of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia. Sotalol works by prolonging the action potential of cardiac myocytes, which helps to restore and maintain normal sinus rhythm.

However, sotalol can also cause a variety of side effects, including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. QT prolongation is a condition in which the QT interval on an electrocardiogram is prolonged. Torsade de pointes is a type of ventricular tachycardia that can be life-threatening.

The patient in this case has a wide complex QRS during sotalol administration. This is a concerning finding, as it could be a sign of QT prolongation or torsade de pointes. The next step in management should be to obtain an ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) to further evaluate the patient's arrhythmia. A Holter monitor is a device that records the patient's heart rhythm for 24-48 hours. This will allow the clinician to determine if the patient is having any arrhythmias while he is not in the hospital. If the patient is found to be having arrhythmias while he is not in the hospital, then he may need to be hospitalized and treated with additional medications or a pacemaker.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation are invasive procedures that are not necessary in this case. Emergency coronary angiogram is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of coronary artery disease. Exercise treadmill test is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not related to exercise.

Title: Atypical Choroidal Mass in an Adult Case is: A 59-year-old Asian man with no history of any systemic illness presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his right eye. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segments were quiet and vitreous was clear in both eyes. Fundus examination in the right eye revealed a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion with a creamy yellow appearance in the macular region involving the optic disc (Figure 1A). Ultrasonography confirmed a dome-shaped choroidal mass with intermediate echodensity measuring 14 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescence of the mass and late leakage of the disc. Indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in both early and late phases. Optical coherence tomography disclosed a choroidal mass with undulating surface and shallow subretinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit revealed an intraocular mass with hyperintensity on T1-weighted and hypointensity on T2-weighted scans with contrast enhancement extending into the adjacent retrobulbar fat, suspicious for scleral invasion. Blood test results including a complete blood cell count, tuberculosis, syphilis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were all negative. The patient then developed gingivitis with a white blood cell count up to 12 350/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) in the next 2 weeks that failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics.

Reasoning: The patient has a choroidal mass that is suspicious for malignancy. The mass is large, has intermediate echodensity on ultrasonography, and shows late leakage of the disc on fluorescein angiography. These findings are consistent with a choroidal melanoma. Choroidal melanomas are aggressive tumors that can metastasize to other parts of the body. The patient's gingivitis is a concerning finding, as it may be a sign of systemic metastasis. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform a comprehensive systemic workup to assess for metastatic disease.

Title: A Man With Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Case is: A man in his 40s with a 20-year history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was referred by his primary care physician for evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiography. The echocardiogram was performed because of an abnormal electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia accompanied by high QRS voltage with a strain pattern in the precordial leads. He had no history of other illnesses. On physical examination, the patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 38 kg. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs. Blood test results revealed impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid (32.4 mg/dL) and pyruvate acid (1.91 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 113.56). Review of the transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity (Video). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse biventricular hypertrophy and moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function. A wide range of nodular and band-shaped late gadolinium enhancement was detected in the middle and epicardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. Coronary angiography revealed no significant stenoses of the epicardial coronary arteries.What Would You Do Next?

Title: Progressive Inflammatory Process of the Mandible and Surrounding Soft Tissues Case is: An otherwise healthy White man in his 60s presented with right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling. Symptoms started a year before, after receiving dental implants for new lower dentures. The patient noted right upper and lower eyelid swelling most notable in the morning but denied associated fevers, chills, vision changes, dysphagia, headaches, urinary symptoms, or rashes. Physical examination revealed a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus, mildly tender to palpation. No overlying warmth or erythema and no lymphadenopathy. The patient’s dentures appeared to be well fitting, but mouth opening was at approximately 50% of expected. Laboratory results included an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h, and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results,  and lactate levels. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, A) were most consistent with osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. Right temporalis muscle biopsy results for Gram stain and culture, fungal stain and culture, and acid-fast bacillus stain were unremarkable. The patient’s symptoms did not improve after 7 weeks of empirical intravenous ertapenem followed by 8 weeks of oral cefuroxime and minocycline. Additional laboratory test results, including serum IgG4, SPEP, brucella AB, Q fever AB, RF, urinalysis, and microalbumin/creatinine levels, were all unremarkable. Results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA were negative. Repeated MRI findings showed progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe dura. Findings on positron emission tomographic computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed nonspecific inflammatory changes to the bone, muscle, and brain meninges. A biopsy of the temporalis muscle, sphenoid wing, and dura was performed (Figure, B).A, Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showing inflammation involving the right mandibular ramus and greater wing of sphenoid with overlying myositis involving masticator space.

A biopsy of the temporalis muscle, sphenoid wing, and dura was performed (Figure, B).

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). CRMO is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any bone in the body, but it most commonly affects the mandible and long bones. The exact cause of CRMO is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Symptoms of CRMO can vary depending on the location of the affected bone, but they often include pain, swelling, and tenderness. In some cases, CRMO can also cause fever, fatigue, and weight loss.

There is no cure for CRMO, but there are treatments that can help to control the inflammation and prevent further damage to the bones. Treatment options include corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and bisphosphonates. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected bone.

Title: A Retinal Detachment After International Travel Case is: A 58-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a retinal detachment in his left eye. His visual acuity on presentation was 20/20 in the right eye and hand motion only in the left eye. Examination of the right eye was normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye revealed around 30 cells per high-power field of a 1 mm × 1 mm light beam and diffuse stellate-appearing keratic precipitates. Posterior examination results showed a vitreous cell that precluded a clear view of the posterior pole and inferior snow banking. Most notable was a large, white, preretinal lesion in the inferior macula and a near-total retinal detachment with no identifiable retinal break and shifting subretinal fluid (Figure).A, Fundus photograph of the left eye showing vitritis, a near-total retinal detachment, and a fluffy, white, lesion in the inferior macula (arrow). B, Fluorescein angiography of the left eye demonstrating disc leakage (blue arrowhead) and blockage in the region of the macular lesion (pink arrowhead).His medical history included psoriatic arthritis, for which he had been taking adalimumab. Four months prior to presentation, he had traveled to Costa Rica on vacation and fallen ill with fevers, night sweats, and myalgias. He started a 6-week course of oral ciprofloxacin and his adalimumab was discontinued. After returning to the United States, he developed dyspnea with exertion. He was found to have an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% to 25% with 4-chamber dilation and was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy. Results of limited infectious workup, including blood and stool cultures and tests for leptospirosis and dengue fever, were negative.Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reactionPerform pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment repairWhat Would You Do Next? A: Inject intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime , B: Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction , C: Perform pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair , D: Begin oral prednisone. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a retinal detachment in his left eye. The most common cause of a retinal detachment is a tear in the retina, which allows vitreous fluid to leak into the space between the retina and the choroid. This can cause the retina to detach from the back of the eye, resulting in loss of vision.

The patient's history of travel to Costa Rica and subsequent development of fevers, night sweats, and myalgias suggests that he may have had an infectious illness. Infectious diseases can cause retinal detachment by several mechanisms, including inflammation of the retina, infection of the vitreous humor, or infection of the choroid.

The patient's cardiomyopathy is a non-infectious condition that can cause retinal detachment by several mechanisms, including decreased blood flow to the retina, increased blood pressure in the retina, or increased pressure in the eye.

The patient's limited infectious workup was negative. This does not rule out an infectious cause of the retinal detachment, but it does make it less likely.

The patient's visual acuity is hand motion only in the left eye. This indicates that the retinal detachment is extensive and has caused significant damage to the retina.

The patient's best chance of preserving vision in the left eye is to have a retinal detachment repair surgery. This surgery involves removing the vitreous humor from the eye and repairing the retinal tear.

The patient should also be treated for any underlying medical conditions, such as the cardiomyopathy.

Title: Bilateral Panuveitis and Myeloradiculopathy in a 12-Year-Old Girl Case is: A 12-year-old girl presented for assessment of abnormal gait. A year prior, she was found to have bilateral panuveitis with occlusive retinal periphlebitis involving all quadrants of the central and peripheral retina with capillary nonperfusion (Figure 1). Her subsequent workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers and subcentimeter chest and abdominal lymph nodes. Given a positive interferon-γ release assay, therapy was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (RIPE) and corticosteroids for presumed tuberculosis.A, Late-frame fluorescein angiography showing hyperfluorescence of the optic nerve head, segmental vascular leakage and staining, and retinal nonperfusion downstream of obliterated vessels (pink arrowheads). B, Widefield fundus photograph of the left eye showing scattered intraretinal hemorrhage and segmented periphlebitis (white arrowheads) with prominent venous sheathing and tortuosity and optic disc hyperemia (blue arrowhead).At the time of presentation, she had completed RIPE therapy and was taking mycophenolate mofetil with resolution of her ocular manifestations. She complained of new bilateral lower extremity weakness with associated lower back pain. Clinical examination results revealed a wide-based Trendelenburg gait with right foot drop and diminished strength of lower extremity flexors. Laboratory testing results showed a normal white blood cell count, vitamin B12, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, C-reactive protein, and antinuclear antibody levels. She had negative test results for Lyme disease, syphilis, and HIV. Computed tomography showed small supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated mild lacrimal gland prominence and low thoracic/high lumbar spine and cauda equina nerve roots hyperintensity and abnormal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with an elevated protein level, negative syphilis antibody results, and an absence of organisms on acid-fast bacilli smear, Gram stain, and culture.What Would You Do Next? A: Start plasmapheresis , B: Perform a lacrimal gland biopsy , C: Reinitiate RIPE therapy , D: Obtain thoracic lymph node biopsy. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient in this case has a history of bilateral panuveitis and myeloradiculopathy. She was initially treated with RIPE therapy, which resulted in resolution of her ocular manifestations. However, she subsequently developed new bilateral lower extremity weakness with associated lower back pain. Her clinical examination and laboratory testing results are consistent with a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). NMOSD is a rare, autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system, particularly the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is characterized by episodes of inflammation and demyelination of the nerve fibers, which can lead to vision loss, weakness, and other neurological symptoms.

The first-line treatment for NMOSD is immunosuppression with a combination of corticosteroids and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). In this case, the patient was initially treated with RIPE therapy, which is a combination of four drugs that are used to treat tuberculosis. However, RIPE therapy is not effective for NMOSD. Therefore, the next step in the patient's management should be to start plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma. This procedure can help to remove antibodies that are attacking the nerve fibers in the patient's central nervous system.

Title: Recurrent Photosensitive Pustular Eruption in a Young Woman Case is: A woman in her 20s was referred for evaluation of a 4-year history of recurrent pustular eruptions on her face, which initially presented while she was vacationing in Florida. She noted mild associated pruritus but denied burning sensation. The eruptions occurred intermittently, appearing as erythematous papules with prominent pustules, and were exacerbated by sunlight. On average, her lesions would resolve in 3 to 4 days with only mild background erythema by 5 to 7 days. Even mild sun exposure would induce the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. Trials with various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin did not prevent flares or mitigate severity of eruptions when they occurred. She denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. She was otherwise healthy without other medical history.On physical examination, she was well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose (Figure, A). No nail fold capillary changes or mucosal lesions were observed. Serum analysis results for antinuclear, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La antibodies were negative. A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline (Figure, B-D).A, Pustular eruption of the face characterized by monomorphous 1- to 2-mm pustules over background erythema on the cheeks, chin, and nose appearing less than 24 hours after sun exposure.

Reasoning:
The patient is a young woman with a 4-year history of recurrent pustular eruptions on her face that are exacerbated by sunlight. The eruptions appear as erythematous papules with prominent pustules and resolve in 3 to 4 days. Even mild sun exposure induces the eruption, leading to frequent recurrences in summer months but long periods of remission in the fall through spring. She has tried various broad-spectrum sunscreens in combination with topical and oral antibiotics and topical ivermectin, but these have not prevented flares or mitigated severity of eruptions. She denies joint pain, fever, fatigue, changes in urine color, use of other topical or systemic medications, or presence of rashes elsewhere. She is otherwise healthy without other medical history.

On physical examination, she is well appearing with numerous 1- to 2-mm monomorphous pustules over background erythema on the medial cheeks, chin, and nose.

A 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from a representative lesion along the right jawline.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of actinic folliculitis. Actinic folliculitis is a photodermatosis characterized by recurrent crops of sterile pustules on sun-exposed skin. It is most common in middle-aged and older adults, but it can occur in younger individuals, as in this case. The pathogenesis of actinic folliculitis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of sun exposure and follicular occlusion. Sunlight-induced damage to the follicular epithelium leads to inflammation and rupture of the follicles, with release of inflammatory mediators into the surrounding dermis. This triggers an immune response, with infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the affected area. The clinical presentation of actinic folliculitis is typically that of recurrent crops of sterile pustules on sun-exposed skin. The lesions are often pruritic and may be tender. They typically resolve spontaneously within a few days, but they can recur frequently, especially in the summer months. The diagnosis of actinic folliculitis is usually made clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. However, a skin biopsy may be helpful in some cases to rule out other possible diagnoses, such as acne vulgaris or folliculitis decalvans. Treatment of actinic folliculitis is aimed at preventing and treating sun exposure. Sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher should be applied to the affected areas daily, even on cloudy days. Broad-brimmed hats and sunglasses can also help to protect the skin from the sun's harmful rays. Topical corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing inflammation and relieving itching. In severe cases, oral antibiotics may be necessary to treat the infection.

Title: Multiple Craniofacial Nodules and Plaques Distributed Bilaterally Along Blaschko Lines Case is: A male in his late teens presented with asymptomatic congenital papules, plaques, and nodules in a linear bilateral distribution following Blaschko lines on the scalp and face region. The papules and nodules appeared to grow as the boy grew, and some pedunculated lesions tended to fall off spontaneously. He had not received any prior treatment. The patient had no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions. Clinical examination findings revealed multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions (Figure, A and B). However, no hair was observed on the lesion because the patient had shaved the hair on his face.

Reasoning: The patient presents with multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules of varying sizes protruding from the skin surface on the right cheek, forehead, and jaw, as well as on the anterior surface of the scalp, distributed along Blaschko lines, with sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions. The lesions are asymptomatic and have been present since birth. The patient has no other significant medical history and denied having a family history of similar lesions.

The clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of hair follicle nevus. Hair follicle nevi are benign congenital lesions that are characterized by the proliferation of hair follicles. They typically present as multiple skin-colored, nontender soft papules or nodules that are distributed along Blaschko lines. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they may occasionally become inflamed or infected.

The diagnosis of hair follicle nevus is made clinically. However, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible conditions. The biopsy will show an increased number of hair follicles, as well as a proliferation of the surrounding connective tissue.

The treatment of hair follicle nevi is usually not necessary. However, if the lesions are cosmetically disfiguring, they may be removed by surgery or laser therapy.

Title: Diffusing Capacity of the Lungs for Carbon Monoxide Test Case is: A 62-year-old man without a history of cigarette smoking presented with a 4- to 6-month history of increasing exertional dyspnea. He had no significant history of cardiopulmonary disease. Physical examination findings, including chest auscultation, were unremarkable. Measured hemoglobin was 15.3 g/dL (World Health Organization normal range, 13.8-17.2 g/dL). Chest computed tomographic imaging was unremarkable. Pulmonary function test results are shown in the Table.The isolated reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is explained by the hemoglobin levelThe isolated reduced Dlco is not important because the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume are normalThe isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormalityThe isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects early small airway diseaseHow Do You Interpret These Test Results? A: The isolated reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is explained by the hemoglobin level , B: The isolated reduced Dlco is not important because the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume are normal , C: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality , D: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects early small airway disease. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The isolated reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is likely explained by an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. This is because the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) are normal, which suggests that there is no obstruction of the large airways. Additionally, the hemoglobin level is normal, which means that the reduced Dlco is not due to a lack of hemoglobin. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the reduced Dlco is an abnormality in the transfer of gas across the alveolar-capillary membrane.

The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. EGPA is a rare, multisystem vasculitis characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils into the blood vessels. It can affect the lungs, kidneys, heart, skin, and nervous system. The most common symptoms of EGPA are asthma, sinusitis, and pulmonary infiltrates. Neurological involvement can occur in up to 50% of patients with EGPA and can manifest as headache, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, and stroke. The diagnosis of EGPA is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings (eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE levels), and imaging studies (pulmonary infiltrates, organomegaly). Treatment of EGPA is with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.

Title: Blurred Vision and Gastrointestinal Bleeding in a Patient With HIV Case is: A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 5 months of epigastric pain and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. He had no fevers or night sweats. Physical examination was notable for oral thrush and mild epigastric tenderness. Results of a fourth-generation HIV Ab/Ag combination assay were positive, and subsequent testing showed a CD4 cell count of 16/mm3 and an HIV viral load greater than 10 million copies/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed thickening of the walls of the stomach, duodenum, and colon as well as multiple masses in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 6.9 cm in diameter. A core biopsy of one of the liver masses demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He started antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide and chemotherapy with rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH).Four weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed sudden onset of bright red blood per rectum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Mesenteric computed tomography angiography demonstrated active extravasation in the jejunum from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. After unsuccessful coil embolization, he underwent open resection of 40 cm of distal small intestine; pathological examination of a stained section showed acute inflammation of the lamina propria, with crypt epithelial apoptosis and numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions with an “owl eye” appearance (Figure 1, left panel). Five weeks later, he developed blurred vision, and visual acuity testing revealed 20/50 vision in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye. A dilated retinal examination revealed extensive macular hemorrhage in the left eye, with peripapillary whitening and perivascular hemorrhage with whitening along the superior vascular arcade (Figure, right panel).Left, Representative section of patient’s small bowel showing cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo (“owl eye” sign, arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×40).

**Reasoning:** The patient has developed blurred vision and gastrointestinal bleeding, which are both potential complications of HIV-associated lymphoma. In this case, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. CMV retinitis is a sight-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. The first-line treatment for CMV retinitis is intravenous ganciclovir. However, in this case, the patient has already received intravenous ganciclovir for his gastrointestinal bleeding, and it is not clear whether this treatment was effective. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry. This procedure will allow us to determine whether the patient has CMV retinitis and, if so, to identify the specific strain of CMV that is causing the infection. This information will be helpful in selecting the most appropriate treatment.

Prior to delivery, she underwent diagnostic ultrasound of the right breast, which showed a possible mass in the location of the palpable lesion that was most consistent with a normal island of fibroglandular tissue. Follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast (without axillary evaluation) were performed 6 months later, which showed an irregular 17-mm mass with associated pleomorphic calcifications in the same area. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology showed high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). On postbiopsy physical examination, the patient had a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy.Surgical treatment with lumpectomy was recommended, and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to surgery to evaluate the extent of disease (Figure). Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes; axial postcontrast T1 fat-saturated MRI of the right breast revealed an irregular mass with irregular margins at the site of biopsy-proven DCIS.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of high-grade, estrogen receptor–positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the right breast. She underwent a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the right arm the day before a breast MRI. The MRI showed edema surrounding two enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes.

The differential diagnosis for enlarged axillary lymph nodes includes metastatic cancer, infection, and inflammation. In this case, the patient's history of DCIS makes metastatic cancer the most likely diagnosis. However, it is important to rule out infection and inflammation before proceeding with treatment.

A repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination would be helpful to assess for changes in the size and appearance of the axillary lymph nodes. However, this would not provide definitive information about the cause of the lymphadenopathy.

A right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination would be more helpful to assess the size and appearance of the axillary lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are found to be enlarged and morphologically abnormal, a biopsy could be performed to determine the cause of the lymphadenopathy.

An axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy would be the most definitive way to determine the cause of the lymphadenopathy. However, this would also be the most invasive procedure.

In this case, I would recommend performing a right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes. This would allow me to obtain a tissue diagnosis without the need for a more invasive procedure.

**Answer:**

D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

Title: Severe Polyarthralgia After Kidney Transplant Case is: A 51-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of intense and worsening polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes. There was no history of alopecia, oral ulcers, rashes, or Raynaud phenomenon. She did not report preceding fever, diarrhea, or dysuria. There was no history of weight loss or anorexia. Medical history included tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. The patient had successfully received an ABO-incompatible kidney transplant 1 year ago, but this was complicated by invasive fungal (Volvariella volvacea) infection of the central nervous system. Medications included tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), prednisolone (10 mg daily), cinacalcet (12.5 mg daily), and voriconazole (500 mg daily). On examination, her fingers and toes were symmetrically and diffusely swollen and tender. There was no rash, enthesitis, psoriatic nail changes, clubbing, or lower limb edema. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.Alkaline phosphatase level was elevated at 640 U/L (10.69 μkat/L) (reference range, 40-130 U/L [0.67-2.17 μkat/L]). Corrected calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were 10.88 mg/dL (2.71 mmol/L) (reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL [2.15-2.55 mmol/L]) and 23.7 pmol/L (reference range, 1.3-9.3), respectively. Serum bilirubin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, creatinine, and phosphate levels were within reference ranges. Free thyroxine and thyrotropin levels were normal. Results of testing for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody were negative. Her chest radiograph was unremarkable. Radiography of her hands was performed (Figure).What Would You Do Next? A: Obtain a positron emission computed tomography scan , B: Perform a bone biopsy , C: Schedule parathyroidectomy , D: Stop voriconazole. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a known complication of kidney transplant. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a decrease in the production of calcitriol, a hormone that helps the body absorb calcium from the diet. This can lead to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which can cause bone pain, weakness, and fractures.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone turnover. Her calcium and PTH levels are also elevated, consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The patient's chest radiograph was unremarkable, ruling out a pulmonary embolism as a cause of her symptoms. Radiography of her hands showed no evidence of fractures or joint disease.

The next step in the evaluation is to obtain a positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan is a nuclear medicine imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer to detect areas of increased metabolic activity in the body. PET scans are often used to diagnose cancer, but they can also be used to diagnose other conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism.

If the PET scan shows increased metabolic activity in the bones, this would confirm the diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The patient would then be treated with a medication called cinacalcet, which lowers PTH levels. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove one or more parathyroid glands.

Title: Blurry Vision in a Patient With Leukemia Case is: A 57-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) presented for subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes. He had been admitted for an upcoming bone marrow transplant. The patient had floaters without flashes and denied any eye pain. A review of symptoms found chronic fatigue and a new, mild headache beginning a few days prior. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/50 OU; intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS; and pupils were equal, round, and reactive, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements, confrontational visual fields, and Ishihara color plates were full. An anterior segment examination had normal results. A fundus examination revealed clinically significant peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins of both eyes (Figure 1). A peripheral retinal examination of both eyes had normal results.Optic nerve photographs of the right eye (A) and left eye (B) revealing elevated, multilayered peripapillary hemorrhages and whitening, with obscured optic nerve margins except for the temporal aspect of the left optic nerve.A rapid referral to radiation oncology for bilateral optic nerve radiationMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbitsWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes, with floaters and a new, mild headache. He has a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors. On examination, he has clinically significant peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins of both eyes. These findings are concerning for optic nerve compression, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including leukemia. The most likely cause in this case is leukemic infiltration of the optic nerve sheath.

Answer: The next step in management is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits to confirm the diagnosis of optic nerve compression and to assess for any other intracranial abnormalities. If the MRI is positive for optic nerve compression, the patient will need to be treated with high-dose corticosteroids and/or radiation therapy to reduce the swelling and inflammation of the optic nerve. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to decompress the optic nerve.

Therapy with intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections is not indicated in this case because it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's visual loss. Observation and reassurance are also not appropriate because the patient's vision is at risk and requires urgent intervention.

Reasoning:
The patient has subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes, floaters without flashes, and a new, mild headache. He has chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib). On examination, he has visual acuity of 20/50 OU, intraocular pressures of 15 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS, pupils that are equal, round, and reactive, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements, confrontational visual fields, and Ishihara color plates are full. An anterior segment examination has normal results. A fundus examination reveals clinically significant peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins of both eyes. A peripheral retinal examination of both eyes has normal results.

The most likely diagnosis is leukostasis. Leukostasis is a syndrome that occurs when there is a rapid increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood. This can lead to sludging of white blood cells in the microvasculature, which can cause ischemia and infarction of various organs, including the eyes. The classic presentation of leukostasis is subacute-onset blurred vision, headache, and confusion.

The treatment of leukostasis is aimed at reducing the number of white blood cells in the blood. This can be done with chemotherapy, plasmapheresis, or leukopheresis. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used.

In the case of this patient, I would recommend a rapid referral to radiation oncology for bilateral optic nerve radiation. This is a standard treatment for leukostasis that can help to reduce the swelling and inflammation of the optic nerves. I would also recommend a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits to rule out any other causes of the patient's visual symptoms.

Title: Homonymous Hemianopia With Normal Neuroimaging Case is: A 46-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of a persistent blurred area in his right lower visual field of both eyes. He noticed colors surrounding the dark area that lasted 2 to 3 minutes at a time and occurred multiple times per day. His medical history was significant for dyslipidemia for which he took rosuvastatin. He also reported feeling lethargic, with polydipsia and a dull mild holocephalic headache during this period. Ophthalmological examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/20 OU, pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and color vision was normal. Dilated fundus examination was normal. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm fast visual field testing revealed a right homonymous hemianopia denser inferiorly (Figure, A). An urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was obtained and was normal (Figure, B). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was initially reported as normal but revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex after further review (Figure, B).Measure C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation ratePerform lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid contentsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient has a history of dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for stroke. He also presents with a new-onset homonymous hemianopia, which is a classic symptom of stroke. The noncontrast CT scan of the head is normal, which makes it less likely that the patient has a large vessel occlusion. However, the MRI of the brain reveals subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex. This suggests that the patient may have a small vessel occlusion or a nonischemic cause of the homonymous hemianopia, such as migraine or occipital lobe epilepsy.

**Answer:**
The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to measure blood glucose levels. This is because diabetes is another risk factor for stroke and can also cause homonymous hemianopia. If the patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, he should be treated for diabetes.

If the patient's blood glucose levels are normal, the next step is to perform a lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid contents. This is because a lumbar puncture can help to diagnose nonischemic causes of homonymous hemianopia, such as migraine or occipital lobe epilepsy.

If the lumbar puncture is normal, the next step is to perform magnetic resonance angiography of the head. This is because magnetic resonance angiography can help to diagnose large vessel occlusions.

A: Measure C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate

This is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are markers of inflammation. However, there is no evidence of inflammation in this patient.

B: Measure blood glucose levels

This is the next step in the evaluation of this patient. Blood glucose levels should be measured to rule out diabetes.

C: Perform lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid contents

This is the next step in the evaluation of this patient if the patient's blood glucose levels are normal. A lumbar puncture can help to diagnose nonischemic causes of homonymous hemianopia, such as migraine or occipital lobe epilepsy.

D: Perform magnetic resonance angiography of the head

This is the next step in the evaluation of this patient if the lumbar puncture is normal. Magnetic resonance angiography can help to diagnose large vessel occlusions.

Title: An Atypical Case of Optic Neuropathy Case is: A 17-year-old previously healthy girl presented with 3 months of decreased vision in the right eye associated with throbbing pain with eye movement. The patient had no history of weakness, incontinence, or severe headaches. Initial presentation was notable for hand motion visual acuity with a 2+ relative afferent pupillary defect on the right; fundus examination revealed grade IV disc edema with obscuration of all major vessels on the disc (Figure, A). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain with and without gadolinium contrast was degraded by motion and orthodontic artifact but was suggestive of optic nerve enhancement consistent with optic neuritis. Results of serology tests and cerebral spinal fluid analysis were negative for infectious and inflammatory etiologies, including syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, viral etiologies, multiple sclerosis, and lupus.The patient started treatment with intravenous methylprednisone and plasmapheresis for a presumptive diagnosis of optic neuritis; however, after 3 days there was minimal improvement and a second MRI of the brain and orbits was performed (Figure, B). The second MRI revealed a fusiform expansion of the right optic nerve and enhancement of the orbital, canalicular, and prechiasmatic segments of the right optic nerve, suggestive of an optic nerve glioma. Two weeks after initial presentation, the visual acuity in the right eye progressed to no light perception. Repeated MRI showed progression of the lesion with masslike expansion at the chiasm measuring 1.3 cm (anterior-posterior) × 1.5 cm (craniocaudal) × 1.1 cm (transverse).

The left visual field remained full.

Given the patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is optic nerve glioma. Optic nerve gliomas are a rare type of brain tumor that arise from the glial cells that support the optic nerve. They are most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults, and they are typically benign (non-cancerous). However, optic nerve gliomas can grow and spread to other parts of the brain, and they can cause significant vision loss.

The treatment of optic nerve gliomas depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's age and overall health. In some cases, surgery may be recommended to remove the tumor. In other cases, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used to shrink the tumor or prevent it from growing.

In the case of this patient, the tumor has progressed rapidly and has caused significant vision loss. Given the patient's age and overall health, I would recommend surgery to remove the tumor. This would involve making an incision through the skin and skull to access the tumor. The tumor would then be removed as much as possible, while taking care to preserve the optic nerve and other important structures.

After surgery, the patient would likely need to undergo chemotherapy or radiation therapy to prevent the tumor from growing back. She would also need to be monitored closely for any signs of recurrence.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 50s who presented with an asymptomatic, arc-shaped, depressed skin groove on the left side of his forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. Localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area were observed. The patient reported that when the lesion had begun to appear, approximately 10 years earlier, he had received 2 doses of intralesional steroid via injection on a small bald patch on the vertex.

Title: Oral Lichenoid Lesions Associated With Mediastinal Mass and Hypogammaglobulinemia in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A White man in his 50s with a clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea presented with painful oral erosions that began 2 years before. Results of a previous intestinal biopsy had shown unspecific findings and absence of apoptosis. He reported a 5-kg weight loss that he attributed to impaired intake owing to the oral lesions. He was also being evaluated for a mediastinal mass detected in radiography of the chest performed for pneumonia. Physical examination revealed whitish edematous lacy patches with erosions on the dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue and buccal mucosa (Figure, A); skin and nails were not involved. A lingual biopsy specimen was obtained for pathologic evaluation and direct immunofluorescence (DIF; Figure, B and C). The result of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using monkey esophagus, salt-skin split, and rat bladder as substrates, was negative. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis did not detect any desmoglein-1 or -3, bullous pemphigoid-180 or -230, collagen VII, desmocollin-1 to -3, laminin-332, envoplakin, or periplakin antibodies.

Positron emission tomography revealed a 10-cm hypercapturing extrapulmonary mass. Surgical excision of the mediastinal mass was performed; its histopathologic features were consistent with a type AB thymoma, Masaoka-Koga stage 2A.

The most likely diagnosis is paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS). PAMS is a rare, paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of autoimmune diseases in multiple organ systems in the setting of a neoplasm. The most common neoplasm associated with PAMS is thymoma, which is present in approximately 50% of cases. The other most common neoplasms associated with PAMS are Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and breast cancer.

The pathogenesis of PAMS is not fully understood. However, it is thought to be caused by the release of tumor antigens that cross-react with self-antigens, leading to the activation of the immune system and the development of autoimmune disease.

The clinical manifestations of PAMS are variable and depend on the organ systems involved. The most common manifestations include skin rash, arthritis, myositis, and serositis. Other manifestations may include gastrointestinal disease, renal disease, and neurological disease.

The diagnosis of PAMS is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The laboratory findings may include the presence of autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF). Imaging studies may reveal the presence of a neoplasm, such as a thymoma.

The treatment of PAMS is aimed at treating the underlying neoplasm and the autoimmune diseases. Treatment of the neoplasm may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Treatment of the autoimmune diseases may include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, or plasmapheresis.

The prognosis of PAMS is variable and depends on the underlying neoplasm and the autoimmune diseases. The overall survival rate for patients with PAMS is approximately 50%. However, the survival rate for patients with thymoma-associated PAMS is significantly higher, at approximately 80%.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a young man with no significant medical history who presents with a 1-day history of intermittent palpitations and chest pain associated with shortness of breath. His vital signs are stable, and his physical examination is unremarkable. His electrocardiogram shows T wave inversions in V1 through V3, which is a non-specific finding. His echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function and no valvular abnormalities.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and pericarditis. The most likely diagnosis is an arrhythmia, given the patient's history of palpitations. However, it is important to rule out other causes of chest pain, such as myocardial ischemia.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a stress echocardiogram. This test will help to assess the patient's left ventricular function and to rule out myocardial ischemia. If the stress echocardiogram is normal, then the patient can be treated for his arrhythmia. If the stress echocardiogram is abnormal, then the patient may need further testing, such as a cardiac catheterization.

Title: Acute Myelopathy in a Man With Cutaneous Papules Case is: A 46-year-old man presented with acute-onset weakness of his bilateral lower limbs for 3 days, accompanied by ascending numbness to just below his nipples. Three weeks prior, he had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in his legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion (Figure 1A). Notably, he had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia (Figure 1B). Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine showing an area of hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7 (A) (arrowhead). Multiple papules were seen on the patient’s abdomen. These consisted of hypopigmented papules with central hyperpigmented umbilication and larger papules with typical central atrophic porcelain white scarring (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 46-year-old man with a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia. Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.

The most likely diagnosis is malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP). MAP is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by the development of atrophic papules on the skin. The papules are typically hypopigmented or hyperpigmented and may have a central umbilication. MAP is associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Sjögren's syndrome.

The patient's history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption that worsened over time is consistent with MAP. The fact that the papules were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia, is also consistent with MAP. The negative findings on the workup for malignancy, including the full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), further support the diagnosis of MAP. The biopsy of the skin papules showed atrophic epidermis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, which is also consistent with MAP.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of vasculitic disorders, including Henoch-Schönlein purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of Chlamydia-associated vasculitis. Chlamydia-associated vasculitis is a rare but well-described syndrome that occurs in association with infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The vasculitis is typically self-limited and resolves with treatment of the Chlamydia infection.

The first step in the management of this patient is to confirm the diagnosis of Chlamydia infection. This can be done by testing the patient's urine for Chlamydia DNA using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). If the NAAT is positive, the patient should be treated with a course of antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin.

Once the Chlamydia infection has been treated, the patient's vasculitis should resolve. However, in some cases, the vasculitis may persist or recur. In these cases, the patient may need to be treated with additional medications, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs.

**Answer:**

The correct answer is D. Order a urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis.

Despite taking antibiotics for 7 days, she had no improvement in her symptoms. One day prior to presentation, the urgent care clinic notified the patient that her throat culture results were negative.
On presentation, the patient was in no acute distress and had normal vital signs. She had bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but no exudate was observed elsewhere in the oral cavity and the uvula was midline. There was no axillary or inguinal adenopathy and no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.
The differential diagnosis for pharyngitis includes bacterial infections (group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae), viral infections (adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus), and fungal infections (Candida albicans). In this case, the patient's negative rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test make group A streptococcus and mononucleosis unlikely. The patient's lack of fever, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash makes a viral infection less likely. The patient's white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy make a bacterial infection more likely. The patient's negative throat culture makes group A streptococcus unlikely.
The most likely diagnosis in this case is a bacterial infection, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae is with antibiotics, such as azithromycin.

Title: Diplopia, Ptosis, and Drooling in an 80-Year-Old Woman Case is: An 80-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia accompanied by left-sided upper eyelid ptosis. On further questioning, she reported a 1-week history of drooling when eating. She had no other associated neurological or constitutional symptoms. No anhidrosis was noted. Her medical history was significant for a 2-year history of constant, dull, left-sided facial pain diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia by her treating neurologist and moderately improved with gabapentin and nortriptyline. Recent computed tomography (CT) of the brain, conducted as part of her headache workup, had been reported as normal.On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Extraocular motility testing demonstrated no abduction of the left eye with corresponding large-angle incomitant esotropia increasing when looking to the left (Figure 1). There was 2 mm of left upper eyelid ptosis with preserved levator function. The left pupil was 1 mm smaller than the right in the light, with the difference increasing to 2 mm in the dark. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Cranial nerve examination demonstrated reduced sensation in the left V1-V3 distribution and mild flattening of the nasolabial fold. Corneal sensation was slightly decreased on the left. Intraocular examination, including dilated fundus examination, was normal in both eyes.Perform lumbar puncture to analyze cellular composition of cerebrospinal fluidObtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrastOrder tests of inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and complete blood cell countWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of trigeminal neuralgia who presents with sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia, left-sided upper eyelid ptosis, and a 1-week history of drooling. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a third cranial nerve palsy, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, tumor, infection, and trauma.

The most likely cause of the patient's third cranial nerve palsy is a stroke. Stroke is the most common cause of third cranial nerve palsy in older adults. The patient's age, history of trigeminal neuralgia, and sudden-onset symptoms are all consistent with a stroke.

Other possible causes of the patient's third cranial nerve palsy include tumor, infection, and trauma. Tumor is a less likely cause in an older adult, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Infection is also a less likely cause, but it should be considered in patients with a history of recent travel or exposure to a sick person. Trauma is a less likely cause in an older adult, but it should be considered in patients with a history of head injury.

The next step in the evaluation of the patient's third cranial nerve palsy is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting stroke. An MRI of the brain with contrast can also help to identify other possible causes of the patient's third cranial nerve palsy, such as tumor, infection, and trauma.

Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with anterior uveitis, a non-infectious inflammatory condition of the anterior chamber of the eye. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. In this case, the patient's history of HIV infection and unprotected sexual contact raises the possibility of an infectious cause, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) uveitis. Other possible causes include sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) uveitis.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 OU, which is normal. Intraocular pressure is 12 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS, which is within normal limits. Slitlamp examination demonstrates diffuse scleral injection in both eyes without any scleral thinning. The redness did not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, 10%. Both eyes appeared to be moderately tender to touch. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits without any evidence of intraocular inflammation. Dilated fundus examination was also unremarkable in both eyes.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with anterior uveitis. The most likely cause is an infectious agent, such as CMV. However, other possible causes, such as sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis, and HSV uveitis, should also be considered.

The next step in management is to perform laboratory work-up to identify the underlying cause of the uveitis. This may include testing for CMV, HIV, toxoplasmosis, and HSV. Other tests that may be performed include a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein.

Once the underlying cause of the uveitis has been identified, treatment can be initiated. Treatment for infectious uveitis typically includes the use of antiviral or antifungal medications. Treatment for non-infectious uveitis typically includes the use of corticosteroids. In some cases, other medications, such as immunomodulators, may also be used.

The patient's prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the uveitis. In most cases, uveitis can be treated successfully with medication. However, some cases of uveitis can lead to permanent vision loss.

Title: Waking Up With Cloudy Vision Case is: A 63-year-old woman was referred by optometry after waking up with cloudy vision in the left eye and an ache around the left brow. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. Her intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris (Figure 1). Her ocular history was notable for indiscriminate trauma to her left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of indiscriminate trauma to her left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes. Four years prior, an inferior cystic iris stromal lesion was discovered in the left eye that measured approximately 5 × 2 mm in basal dimensions at the slitlamp. Fine-needle aspiration was negative for malignancy, and the lesion was managed by close follow-up.

The patient presented with cloudy vision in the left eye and an ache around the left brow. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and light perception OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 15 mm Hg OD and 54 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the left eye was remarkable for a large cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o’clock position with iris-cornea touch. The anterior chamber was shallow in the area of the enlarged cystic lesion with a large amount of pigmented cells. The pupil was irregular with blood at the pupillary margin. Her intraocular lens was not visible because of occlusion by a cystic lesion behind the iris.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of conditions, including iris cyst, iris tumor, glaucoma, and trauma. However, the most likely diagnosis is a recurrent iris cyst. This is supported by the patient's history of a previous cystic iris stromal lesion, the presence of a large cystic lesion in the left eye, and the absence of other findings suggestive of a more serious underlying condition.

The management of a recurrent iris cyst depends on the size and location of the cyst, the patient's symptoms, and the presence of any other eye problems. In some cases, observation may be appropriate if the cyst is small and causing no symptoms. However, if the cyst is large or causing symptoms, treatment may be necessary. Treatment options include YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall, observation, biopsy, and glaucoma tube surgery.

In this case, the patient's cyst is large and causing symptoms. Therefore, treatment is necessary. The best treatment option for this patient is YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall. This procedure is safe and effective in treating iris cysts. It is also relatively quick and easy to perform. The patient will likely need to have this procedure repeated at regular intervals to prevent the cyst from recurring.

Title: Bilateral Hypopyon in a Patient With Glaucoma Case is: A 72-year-old woman presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye. Her ocular history included pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye. Past ocular surgery included uncomplicated trabeculectomy in the right eye treated with mitomycin C (3 months prior) and no ocular surgery history in the left eye. Her medical history included pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Computed tomography scan 2 months prior exhibited reactivation and she started treatment with clarithromycin (1000 mg/d), ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d), and rifabutin (300 mg/d).Best-corrected visual acuity was hand motions OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were 4 mm Hg ODand 13 mm Hg OS. Anterior segment examination of the right eye showed substantial conjunctival hyperemia and substantial cellular response in the anterior chamber (2 to 3+) along with a 1-mm hypopyon. There was no leak at the trabeculectomy bleb (negative Seidel test). B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment or mass. Presumed diagnosis of bleb-related infectious endophthalmitis was made and she was referred for treatment. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, including vitreous sampling, and showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate, which was highly suspicious for contaminant. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered after vitreous sampling was performed. Postoperatively, the patient initiated treatment with topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Her visual acuity returned to 20/30.Two months later, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye (counting fingers). Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon (Figure).Slitlamp photograph showing conjunctival hyperemia and hypopyon (arrowhead) of the left eye.Pars plana vitrectomy with hyperemia of intravitreal antibioticsReview and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroidsWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and a trabeculectomy in the right eye. She presented with new-onset decreased vision in the right eye and was found to have a hypopyon. A pars plana vitrectomy was performed and vitreous sampling showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Intravitreal amikacin and vancomycin were administered and the patient's visual acuity returned to 20/30. Two months later, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye. Anterior segment examination showed conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon.

The differential diagnosis for bilateral hypopyon includes infectious endophthalmitis, uveitis, and noninfectious endophthalmitis. In this case, the patient's history of glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation syndrome makes her at increased risk for infectious endophthalmitis. The presence of a hypopyon is a sign of inflammation and infection. The vitreous sampling showed very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of infectious endophthalmitis.

The treatment for infectious endophthalmitis is pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics. This is the standard of care for this condition and has been shown to improve visual outcomes. In this case, the patient had already undergone a pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics for her right eye. However, she presented again with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye. This suggests that she may have a recurrent infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to recommend another pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics for her left eye.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma being treated with pemigatinib, a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor (FGFRi). She presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities. Pemigatinib treatment was initiated 2 months prior to the skin findings. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mildly elevated D-dimer level at 578 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units, prolonged prothrombin time of 12.7 seconds, elevated phosphorus level at 6.8 mg/dL (of note, phosphorus was 3.1 mg/dL 1 month prior), and normal calcium level and kidney function. Other laboratory tests to note include cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen, which both had negative results. Within weeks, there was rapid progression with skin necrosis despite treatment initiation with rivaroxaban. Physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities. A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis.

The most likely diagnosis is calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening, and often fatal disorder characterized by microvascular calcification and tissue necrosis, typically in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and viscera. It is most commonly associated with chronic renal failure, but has also been reported in patients with malignancy, hyperparathyroidism, and other disorders associated with abnormal calcium metabolism. The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including local hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and altered vascular endothelial function.

The clinical presentation of calciphylaxis is typically subacute, with the onset of skin lesions over a period of weeks to months. The lesions are typically painful, and may be preceded by pruritus or paresthesias. The lesions are initially erythematous or violaceous papules or plaques, which may progress to purpura, necrosis, and ulceration. The lesions are typically located on the lower extremities, but may also occur on the upper extremities, trunk, and face.

The diagnosis of calciphylaxis is made based on the clinical presentation and characteristic histopathologic findings. The histopathologic findings of calciphylaxis include microvascular calcification, fibrinoid necrosis, and tissue infarction.

There is no specific treatment for calciphylaxis. Treatment is supportive and aimed at controlling the underlying cause, if possible, and relieving symptoms. Treatment may include antihypertensive medications, phosphate binders, and bisphosphonates. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to debride necrotic tissue or to remove affected organs.

The prognosis of calciphylaxis is poor. The mortality rate from calciphylaxis is high, ranging from 25% to 80%. The risk of death is highest in patients with advanced renal failure and in those who develop calciphylaxis in multiple organ systems.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a young man with large, purple plaques on the left lower extremity. The plaques have been present for years, but the patient noted enlargement and darkening for the past 5 years. The lesions are asymptomatic with no associated pruritus, bleeding, or pain. No treatments or diagnostic workup had been attempted prior to presentation. The patient was otherwise healthy and was a never-smoker with no history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or HIV.

On physical examination, the patient had dark violaceous plaques, scattered subcutaneous nodules, and swelling to the mid-shin of the left lower extremity. There was mild warmth noted, but no palpable bruits. Complete metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, prothrombin, and serology were negative or within normal limits. A punch biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings showed proliferation of superficial and deep vessels, with thickening of the endothelium. This is consistent with the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma.

Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that is most commonly associated with HIV infection. However, it can also occur in people who are not infected with HIV. The disease is characterized by the development of purplish-red lesions on the skin, mucous membranes, or internal organs. The lesions can be single or multiple, and they can be small or large. They may be flat or raised, and they may be smooth or nodular.

Kaposi sarcoma is usually a slow-growing tumor, but it can be aggressive in some cases. The treatment for Kaposi sarcoma depends on the stage of the disease and the patient's overall health. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a man in his 30s with a history of multiple painless subcutaneous nodules on his right cheek of 4 years’ duration. He also reported episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, exacerbated with exposure to hay dust, in the past 5 years. He also reported recent-onset headache while reading. Physical examination revealed a depressed plaque measuring 6 × 4 cm in the right infraorbital region, surrounded by multiple nodules of sizes ranging from 1 × 1 cm to 5 × 1 cm. The nodules were firm, mobile, and nontender on palpation. Local temperature was normal. There was proptosis of the right eye with mild restriction of extraocular movements on lateral gaze.

Respiratory system examination revealed occasional polyphonic wheeze. Chest radiography imaging showed nodular opacities in right upper zone and bronchiectasis. Punch biopsy from 1 nodule was sent for histopathological and microbiological examination.

The histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed an inflammatory infiltrate composed of giant cells in the deeper dermis extending into the subcutaneous fat. There were also epithelioid cell granulomas and fungal profiles within giant cells. The periodic acid–Schiff stain highlighted septate fungal hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, cutaneous aspergillosis, phaeohyphomycosis, and entomophthoromycosis. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are a group of diseases caused by mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They can affect the skin, lungs, bones, and other organs. The most common nontuberculous mycobacterial infection of the skin is Mycobacterium marinum infection, which is also known as swimming pool granuloma. Cutaneous aspergillosis is a fungal infection of the skin that is caused by the fungus Aspergillus. It can occur in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer. Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection of the skin, lungs, and other organs that is caused by a variety of fungi, including Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Cladosporium carrionii, and Phialophora verrucosa. Entomophthoromycosis is a fungal infection of the skin, lungs, and other organs that is caused by a variety of fungi, including Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Blastomyces dermatitidis.

The patient's history of multiple painless subcutaneous nodules on his right cheek of 4 years’ duration, his history of episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, exacerbated with exposure to hay dust, in the past 5 years, and his recent-onset headache while reading, are all consistent with a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen, which showed an inflammatory infiltrate composed of giant cells in the deeper dermis extending into the subcutaneous fat, epithelioid cell granulomas, and fungal profiles within giant cells, is also consistent with a diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. The periodic acid–Schiff stain, which highlighted septate fungal hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells, is further evidence of a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.

Title: Multiple Systemic Lesions in a Middle-aged Woman With a History of Lymphoma Case is: A woman in her mid-60s, who was in remission following successful combination chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma 8 years previously, presented with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. On examination, she was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), white blood cell count of 9900/µL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and normal coagulation profile. Serum immunoglobulin quantitation showed normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels of 1590 mg/L, 303 mg/L, and 94 mg/L, respectively (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01). Blood culture findings were negative.Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (Figure 1 and Video) showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.Midesophageal transesophageal echocardiography views of the intracardiac mass (arrowheads).Perform a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar massPerform an urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac massWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient in this case has a history of Burkitt lymphoma, which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma, which means that it starts in B cells, a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection. B-cell lymphomas can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, lungs, and heart.

The patient in this case presents with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. These symptoms are consistent with heart failure, which can be a complication of Burkitt lymphoma. The patient also has a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. This mass is likely a tumor, and it is likely that the tumor has spread to the heart from the patient's original lymphoma.

The patient's condition is serious, and she requires urgent treatment. The best course of treatment is not clear, but it is likely that the patient will need surgery to remove the tumor from her heart. The patient may also need chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to treat her lymphoma.

Answer: B. Perform an urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac mass.

**Reasoning:**
The patient's history of progressive lower extremity pain and gait imbalance, as well as her neurological examination findings of reduced pinprick sensation in both feet and absent vibratory sensation at the first toes, mild weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, and absent ankle jerk reflexes, are all consistent with a diagnosis of polyneuropathy.

The nerve conduction studies (NCS) results show prolonged distal latencies and decreased sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), which are consistent with axonal degeneration. The needle electromyography (EMG) results show decreased recruitment of motor units and increased polyphasic motor units, which are also consistent with axonal degeneration.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is axonal polyneuropathy.

Title: Blue Pigmentation of the Skin, Sclera, and Teeth Case is: A 69-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of progressive skin discoloration. His medical history included chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, cirrhosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and atrial fibrillation with prophylactic apixaban. He had recurrent staphylococcus bacteremia due to infection of an ICD lead and had been treated for the past 6 months with minocycline, 100 mg twice daily. His arms had been purple and bruise-like for several years but turned a near black color 1 month ago. He reported no discoloration of his sweat or urine. He had no history of malnutrition and reported infrequent alcohol use.Physical examination showed dense blue-black skin pigmentation of his forearms, dorsal hands, legs, and dorsal feet, as well as blue discoloration of his sclerae and teeth (Figure 1). He had normal-colored nails and oral mucosa. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 15 800/μL (reference range, 4000-11 000/μL), hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL), platelet count of 58 000/μL (reference, 150 000-400 000/μL), and INR of 1.8 (reference, 0.8-1.1). Complete metabolic panel showed increased creatinine (1.51 mg/dL; reference, 0.64-1.27 mg/dL) and elevated total bilirubin (1.7 mg/dL; reference range, 0.3-1.2 mg/dL). His estimated glomerular filtration rate was 40 mL/min/1.73 m2.What Would You Do Next? A: Discontinue apixaban , B: Discontinue minocycline , C: Order serum iron studies , D: Order serum niacin levels. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's blue skin pigmentation is most likely due to minocycline-induced argyria, a rare but well-recognized side effect of minocycline therapy. Argyria is caused by the deposition of silver in the skin, sclerae, and other tissues. It is a permanent condition, but the discoloration may fade over time.

Answer: B. Discontinue minocycline.

The most important step in the management of minocycline-induced argyria is to discontinue the medication. The discoloration may improve over time, but it is a permanent condition. There is no treatment for minocycline-induced argyria, but the discoloration may be masked with makeup.

A. Discontinue apixaban is not necessary in this case. Apixaban is an anticoagulant that is used to prevent blood clots. The patient's skin discoloration is not caused by a blood clot, so there is no need to discontinue apixaban.

C. Order serum iron studies is not necessary in this case. The patient's skin discoloration is not caused by iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, which can cause pale skin. The patient's skin is blue, not pale, so iron deficiency is not the cause of his discoloration.

D. Order serum niacin levels is not necessary in this case. Niacin is a vitamin that is important for energy production. Niacin deficiency can cause a condition called pellagra, which can cause skin discoloration. The patient's skin discoloration is not caused by niacin deficiency.

Title: In Vivo Confocal Microscopy Evaluation of Microbial Keratitis Case is: A woman in her 20s with a history of daily soft contact lens (CL) wear was referred by her local ophthalmologist for a recalcitrant central corneal ulcer in her left eye. She had no history of eye trauma, did not sleep in her CLs, and stopped using CLs at symptom onset. Of note, she had recently been swimming in a freshwater lake prior to the onset of the ulcer. She was initially treated with topical besifloxacin and followed up daily. She appeared to improve clinically with resolution of her epithelial defect after 3 days, and topical loteprednol was added. Results of initial corneal cultures were negative. One week later, she presented with worsening pain and vision, which prompted referral to our cornea clinic where, 2 weeks after her initial presentation, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/150 OS. Left-eye examination demonstrated diffuse microcystic corneal edema and stromal thickening with no Descemet membrane folds (Figure 1A). A 2 × 2-mm stromal opacity was noted paracentrally with no epithelial defects. The anterior chamber demonstrated 1+ cell. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OS. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba were repeated, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed on the stromal infiltrate (Figure 1B). After reviewing the IVCM images, what empirical treatment would you recommend while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures?What Would You Do Next? A: Vancomycin , B: Fluconazole , C: Voriconazole , D: Polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient in this case has a history of daily soft contact lens wear and recently swam in a freshwater lake. These are risk factors for microbial keratitis, which is an infection of the cornea. The patient's symptoms of worsening pain and vision are concerning for a corneal ulcer, which is a deep infection of the cornea. The IVCM images show a stromal infiltrate, which is a collection of inflammatory cells in the stroma of the cornea. This finding is consistent with a corneal ulcer.

The most common causes of microbial keratitis are bacteria, fungi, and acanthamoeba. The patient's history of contact lens wear and swimming in a freshwater lake puts her at risk for infection with Acanthamoeba. However, the IVCM images do not show any evidence of cysts or trophozoites, which are the characteristic findings of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's corneal ulcer is bacteria.

The empiric treatment for bacterial keratitis is a combination of topical antibiotics. Vancomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that cause keratitis. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against fungi. Voriconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against aspergillus and other molds. Polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate are antiseptics that are effective against bacteria and fungi.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation and the IVCM findings are most consistent with bacterial keratitis. Therefore, the empiric treatment of choice is a combination of topical antibiotics, such as vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient should also be advised to discontinue contact lens wear until the ulcer has healed. She should also be instructed to avoid swimming in freshwater lakes and to keep her hands clean when touching her eyes.

Macular schisis is a common finding in patients with glaucoma, and it is often associated with visual field defects. The pathogenesis of macular schisis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including elevated intraocular pressure, retinal ischemia, and inflammation.

There is no specific treatment for macular schisis, and the management of this condition is aimed at controlling the underlying glaucoma. In some cases, laser therapy may be used to stabilize the schisis, but this is not always effective. In patients with significant visual loss, surgery may be considered.

In the case of the patient described above, the best course of management is to observe the patient and monitor her vision closely. If her vision continues to worsen, then laser therapy or surgery may be considered.

Title: Middle-aged Woman With Bilateral Macular Atrophy, Hearing Loss, and Headache Case is: A 45-year-old woman was referred to the medical retina service for evaluation of bilateral macular atrophy noted by her general ophthalmologist. Medical history was positive for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with cochlear origin as determined by an otolaryngologist and headache since age 35 years. She had no history of longer-term use of medications. There was no family history of hearing and vision loss in all immediate family members. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/63 OS. Her pupils were round and reactive. The anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination confirmed the presence of bilateral macular atrophy. Fundus autofluorescence revealed a fairly symmetric loss of autofluorescence in the macula and in the regions surrounding the optic disc (Figure). In proximity of these areas of reduced autofluorescence, a speckled fundus autofluorescence pattern of alternating spots of increased and decreased autofluorescence was also noted. Optical coherence tomography displayed the presence of a bilateral atrophy of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure). The patient’s family underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, which did not display any alteration.A, Fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates an area of pallor in the fundus (blue arrowheads) corresponding to the region of macular atrophy. B, Structural optical coherence tomography (inset image) and green fundus autofluorescence (main image) of the right eye show a macular atrophy that also involves the peripapillary region. The area of retinal pigment epithelium loss is featured by well-demarcated reduced autofluorescence (pink arrowhead) surrounded by speckled hyperautofluorescent areas (yellow arrowhead). Structural optical coherence tomography confirms the presence of atrophy involving the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (red arrowheads in the inset image).Prescribe laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammationGenetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial diseaseWhat Would You Do Next? A: Prescribe laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation , B: Genetic testing to rule out pattern dystrophy , C: Genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease , D: Genetic testing to rule out Stargardt disease. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and headache. These findings are consistent with a mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of inherited disorders that affect the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing organelles in cells. Mitochondrial diseases can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, hearing loss, headache, and fatigue.

Answer:
C. Genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease

Genetic testing is the best way to diagnose a mitochondrial disease. Genetic testing can identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the disease. This information can be used to make a diagnosis, provide treatment recommendations, and provide genetic counseling to the patient and their family.

Other possible answers:
A. Prescribe laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation. This would be appropriate if the patient had other signs or symptoms of inflammation, such as redness, pain, or floaters. However, the patient does not have any of these symptoms, so it is unlikely that intraocular inflammation is the cause of the macular atrophy.
B. Genetic testing to rule out pattern dystrophy. Pattern dystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the retina. It is characterized by the appearance of characteristic patterns on the retina. The patient does not have any of the characteristic patterns of pattern dystrophy, so it is unlikely that this is the cause of the macular atrophy.
D. Genetic testing to rule out Stargardt disease. Stargardt disease is a common genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the macula. It is the most common cause of juvenile macular degeneration. The patient is 45 years old, so it is unlikely that Stargardt disease is the cause of the macular atrophy.

Title: Bilateral Central Retinal Vein Occlusion:  A Presenting Sign of an Ongoing Life-threatening Condition Case is: A 47-year-old woman, with dyslipidemia, presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Anterior segment, tonometry, and pupillary light reflex were unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye showed discretely blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants; the left eye was unremarkable. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan showed a cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye; the left was unremarkable. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was 133 μm OD and 82 μm OS (reference value, 95.4 ± 10.48 μm).1 A fluorescein angiography was scheduled. One week later, the patient returned to our department due to multiple episodes of amaurosis fugax in left eye. By that time, ophthalmoscopy disclosed a mild optic disc swelling, tortuous venous vessels, and retinal hemorrhages bilaterally (Figure 1). The OCT scan showed a CME spontaneous resolution in the right eye while the left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight delay in venous filling but no capillary nonperfusion areas. These features were compatible with bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye.Fundus photography of the right and left eyes showing slightly elevated and blurred optic disc margins (asterisk), mildly tortuous and dilated retinal vessels (black arrowheads), and intraretinal hemorrhages (pink arrowheads) in all quadrants in both eyes. In the left eye, a superficial optic nerve drusen (white arrowhead) was noted.A hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup—including peripheral blood smear, complete blood cell count, serum hyperviscosity, total protein level, protein electrophoresis, factor V Leiden, prothrombin, protein C and S, antithrombin, anticardiolipin, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies—gave normal results. A brain angiomagnetic resonance imaging scan was performed, which excluded central thrombosis.What Would You Do Next? A: Initiate panretinal photocoagulation , B: Perform a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan , C: Follow-up without further intervention , D: Initiate acetylsalicylic acid and no further intervention. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye. Bilateral CRVO is a rare condition, and its underlying cause is often not known. However, it is associated with a number of risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. In some cases, bilateral CRVO may be a sign of an underlying systemic disease, such as vasculitis, hematologic disorders, or cancer.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of an underlying systemic disease. Her laboratory tests are also normal. However, she does have a history of dyslipidemia.

The most common treatment for CRVO is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). PRP is a procedure in which laser is used to destroy a small portion of the retina. This helps to reduce the risk of complications, such as neovascular glaucoma.

However, PRP is not always necessary. In patients with nonischemic CRVO, such as the patient in this case, PRP may not be beneficial. In fact, PRP may actually worsen vision in some patients.

In this case, I would recommend follow-up without further intervention. I would also recommend that the patient continue to take her medications for dyslipidemia.

Title: Unilateral Leg Swelling in a Young Woman Case is: A 33-year-old woman with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. At age 8 months, she was treated with right enucleation and left eye radiotherapy (50.4 Gy). At age 4 years, she developed a recurrence of the retinoblastoma in the nasal cavity and was treated with 4 cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide, and intrathecal cytarabine.Primary care evaluation was prompted by her mother, as the patient had not noticed her lower extremity edema. She had no fevers, weight loss, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or history of deep vein thrombosis. Her physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. She did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. Her vital signs were within normal limits and she ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of her right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 33-year-old woman with a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma as an infant. She presented to a primary care clinic with 1 week of right lower extremity swelling. Her physical examination was notable for firm, nonpitting edema to the hip. She did not have any associated tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or palpable abdominal masses. Her vital signs were within normal limits and she ambulated comfortably. Laboratory work results, including a complete blood cell count with a differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer levels, were within normal limits. Doppler ultrasonography of her right lower extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis. A computed tomography venogram demonstrated a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of blood vessels that can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the head, neck, and upper extremities. It is typically seen in older adults, but it can occur in younger people, especially those with a history of radiation exposure. The most common presenting symptom is a mass, which can be painful or non-painful. Other symptoms may include swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected area. Angiosarcoma can spread to the lungs, liver, and other organs.

The diagnosis of angiosarcoma is made with a biopsy. The treatment for angiosarcoma is surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for angiosarcoma is poor, with a median survival of 12 months.

Title: Cystic Neck Mass in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 44-year-old woman presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms. She first noticed swelling that progressed to pressure and dyspnea while supine. She reported fatigue but denied pain, voice change, weight loss, hemoptysis, and dysphagia. A physical examination revealed a visible and palpable fullness to the right neck without overlying cutaneous or sinus tract changes. Results of a complete blood cell count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and a complete metabolic panel were normal. Ultrasonography showed a 7.9 × 6.3-cm septate cystic mass lateral to the right thyroid gland. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck demonstrated a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe and extending from the level of the piriform sinus to the thoracic inlet (Figure). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL; to convert to ng/L multiply by 1.00). A barium swallow study showed no communication between the cyst and the piriform sinus. Excision in the operating room was performed, and right thyroid lobectomy was necessary because of the intimate association of the lesion to the thyroid lobe.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the neck with coronal (A) and axial (B) views demonstrating the right cystic neck mass.What Is Your Diagnosis?

He underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck that showed a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5.

The most likely diagnosis is **growing teratoma syndrome**. Growing teratoma syndrome is a rare condition that occurs in patients who have been treated for testicular cancer. In this condition, a teratoma that was initially considered to be benign (non-cancerous) begins to grow again after treatment. The growth of the teratoma is usually slow and asymptomatic, but it can occasionally cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, or difficulty breathing.

The diagnosis of growing teratoma syndrome is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI can show a mass that is consistent with a teratoma. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of growing teratoma syndrome depends on the size and location of the tumor, the patient's symptoms, and the patient's overall health. In some cases, the tumor may be able to be treated with surgery alone. In other cases, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.

**Answer:**
C. Growing teratoma syndrome

Title: Hoarseness and Stridor Following Stem Cell Transplant Case is: A 59-year-old man presented with progressive hoarseness and dyspnea over a 2-month period. Fifteen months previously, he had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient had been diagnosed with chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease after a workup for diarrhea. Results of a restaging bone marrow biopsy 2 weeks prior to presentation showed no evidence of leukemia. Physical examination findings revealed no neck masses or abnormalities, but the patient was noted to be severely dysphonic and stridulous. Flexible laryngoscopy findings demonstrated a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway (Figure, A). Awake tracheostomy was performed for airway protection, and biopsy of the neoplasm was obtained via operative microlaryngoscopy (Figure, B). Histologic findings demonstrated diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains showed CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains were negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression.Evaluation of the larynx from awake flexible laryngoscopy (A) including posterior commissure (A, inset) and operative microlaryngoscopy (B) with biopsy (C; original magnification ×40).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of allogeneic stem cell transplant for AML, the presence of chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease, and the findings of a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway are all consistent with a diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma (EMMS). EMMS is a rare, aggressive malignancy of hematopoietic stem cells that typically arises in the soft tissues, including the head and neck. It is often associated with hematologic malignancies, such as AML, and is characterized by the infiltration of large, atypical myeloid cells. The diagnosis of EMMS is made on the basis of biopsy findings, which show a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains are typically positive for CD33, CD43, and CD117, and negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression.

Title: Widespread Erythematous Plaques With Prominent Telangiectases Case is: A woman in her 50s with a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (diagnosed 2 years prior; treated with pembrolizumab and methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone, and pegaspargase) and chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis being treated with fluconazole was admitted for fever, hypotension, and rash. Three months prior, pembrolizumab treatment was stopped because of a widespread morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission. The new widespread, asymptomatic skin eruption had been ongoing for 1 to 2 weeks and appeared different from her pembrolizumab reaction.A complete blood cell count was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 4100/μL, normal absolute neutrophil count of 2940/μL, chronic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL), and chronic thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 62 ×103/μL). Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. Total body skin examination findings were notable for widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation (Figure, A).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, which is a rare type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. The patient also has chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis, which is a fungal infection of the lungs. The patient's current symptoms include fever, hypotension, and rash. The rash is described as widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation. The patient's blood work is notable for a normal white blood cell count, chronic normocytic anemia, and chronic thrombocytopenia. Blood culture results showed no growth at 1 week. Serum β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion results were negative. Respiratory viral panel and SARS-CoV-2 test results were negative. A punch biopsy of a representative lesion was performed. The histopathologic findings showed intravascular atypical cells.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma. This is a rare complication of NK/T-cell lymphoma that can present with fever, hypotension, and rash. The rash is typically described as widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation.

Title: Worsening Cardiomyopathy Despite Biventricular Pacing Case is: A man in his early 70s with a history of permanent atrial fibrillation treated with atrioventricular junction ablation and biventricular pacemaker implantation was hospitalized with decompensated heart failure and acute kidney injury. His history was notable for nonischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 40% and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which he underwent single-lung transplant 9 years prior. Following diuresis and medical optimization, repeated echocardiogram showed a newly depressed ejection fraction (30%). His electrocardiogram (ECG) was notable for alternating QRS morphologies (Figure 1A). The left ventricular (LV) pacing vector was programmed from LV tip to right ventricular (RV) lead ring. During pacemaker threshold testing, a change in QRS morphology was observed as the output was reduced (Figure 1B). Chest radiography revealed severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead position unchanged from implantation.What Would You Do Next? A: Suppress the premature ventricular contractions , B: Increase the basal pacing rate , C: Change the LV pacing configuration , D: Refer for LV lead repositioning. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's worsening cardiomyopathy despite biventricular pacing is likely due to a suboptimal pacing configuration. The alternating QRS morphologies on the ECG suggest that the LV lead is not optimally positioned. This is further supported by the change in QRS morphology observed during pacemaker threshold testing, as well as the chest radiography showing severe right pulmonary fibrosis leading to ipsilateral mediastinal shift. Therefore, the next step in management should be to refer the patient for LV lead repositioning.

Title: Multiple Facial Ulcers Following a Stroke Case is: A 66-year-old man presented with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face that had developed over the past 3 months (Figure, A). He had also experienced a burning sensation on the right side of his face, but denied headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, while cold-warm sensation and motor function were intact. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 82 mm per hour (normal value, less than 15 mm per hour) and the serum C–reactive protein concentration was 107 mg/L (normal value, less than 5 mg/L). Chest radiography showed bilateral perihilar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. About 2 weeks before the ulcerations developed, the patient had been admitted to the hospital for unstable angina, and coronary angiography was performed. Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary (Figure, B).Clinical and radiological findings in a man aged 66 years.A, Multiple ulcers limited to the right half of the face.

Immediately after the angiography, the patient developed left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary.

The most likely diagnosis is trigeminal trophic syndrome. This is a rare disorder that is characterized by the development of painful ulcers on the face, usually in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The ulcers are often preceded by a burning sensation or paresthesia in the affected area. The cause of trigeminal trophic syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve. This damage can be caused by a number of factors, including stroke, trauma, and infection.

The treatment of trigeminal trophic syndrome is difficult. There is no cure for the condition, and treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. This may include the use of pain medication, topical steroids, and surgery.

Title: Retinal Artery Thrombosis and Aortic Valve Vegetations Case is: A 42-year-old woman was referred for ophthalmologic evaluation after developing blurry vision in the right eye 30 days prior. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and migraine headaches. Her medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, and norethindrone. Dilated-fundus examination of the right eye showed a single cotton-wool spot (indicating local retinal ischemia), with intraretinal hemorrhage in the inferotemporal quadrant. Ultrawide-field imaging showed a cotton-wool spot on the left fundus (Figure 1A, right) and a peripheral arterial occlusion in the right eye (Figure 1A, left), and fluorescein angiographic study of the right eye demonstrated an area of blockage corresponding to intraretinal hemorrhage and venous hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B). The patient was afebrile, with pulse 110 beats/min and blood pressure of 188/99 mm Hg. Auscultation over the heart apex revealed a holosystolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Laboratory testing showed normal complete blood cell count and thyrotropin level and negative results for autoantibodies against Sm, SSA, SSB, Scl-70, Jo-1, centromere, chromatin, ribonucleoprotein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated (30 mm/h). Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were positive at low titer (1:40, homogenous pattern) with positive dsDNA (5.0 IU/mL; negative if <4.0 IU/mL).

Title: A Man Who Cannot Elevate His Right Eye or Abduct His Left Eye Case is: A 54-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of right ptosis and double vision. He was otherwise healthy and did not take any regular medications. Initially, he had horizontal diplopia on the first day that was worse at the end of the day, but this resolved when the right eyelid ptosis became complete. He denied any difficulty with his speech, swallowing, weakness, or sensory changes.He presented to the emergency department, and the emergency department physician reported a normal neurological examination result apart from the right-sided ptosis and limited eye movements. He was referred to ophthalmology and had a visual acuity of 20/20 OU. Both pupils were equal sizes and reactive to light. He was found to only have a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye (Figure). He was orthophoric in primary position, and there were no eyelid twitches. Orbicularis oculi strength was reduced on both sides. A dilated fundus examination had normal results bilaterally.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with cranial nerve III palsy, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, tumor, infection, and trauma. In order to determine the cause of the patient's palsy, further testing is necessary.

Answer: C. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast is the most appropriate test to order in this case. This test will allow the physician to visualize the structures of the orbits, including the cranial nerves, and to identify any abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests are not specific for cranial nerve III palsy and would not be helpful in this case. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head may be helpful in ruling out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or tumor, but they are not as sensitive as magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast for detecting abnormalities of the cranial nerves. Ice pack test is not a necessary or helpful test in this case.

His extraocular movements were full, and he had no other neurologic deficits. His visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and his fundi were notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology.On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, his visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. He had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal.Color fundus photographs demonstrate optic nerve pallor, which was greater in the right eye than the left eye.Continue acetazolamide and repeated Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 monthsWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of hypertensive retinopathy and presents with acute-onset, painless vision loss in his right eye accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches. His extraocular movements are full, and he has no other neurologic deficits. His visual acuity is 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, respectively, and his fundi are notable for bilateral optic nerve edema. Results of recent computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were reportedly normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein. The patient was given acetazolamide and referred to neuro-ophthalmology.

On examination by neuro-ophthalmology 4 months later, his visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. He had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields (24-2) showed binasal inferior defects with a superior defect in the right eye that was considered an artifact of testing. According to the Ishihara color plates test, color vision was full in both eyes. Fundus examination was remarkable for pallor of both optic nerves, more notably in the right eye, without edema (Figure 1). Findings of screening for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, Bartonella, HIV, tuberculosis (Quantiferon), Treponema pallidum, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a complete blood cell count were normal.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a rare disorder characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a structural cause. The most common symptoms of IIH are headache, visual impairment, and tinnitus. The diagnosis of IIH is made based on clinical findings and imaging studies, such as a lumbar puncture. Treatment of IIH typically involves the use of acetazolamide, a diuretic that helps to reduce intracranial pressure. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure on the optic nerves.

In the case of the patient described above, the most likely next step is to continue acetazolamide and repeat the Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months. This will allow the physician to monitor the patient's progress and to determine if the treatment is effective. If the patient's vision continues to worsen, the physician may consider other treatment options, such as surgery.

Answer:
D. Continue acetazolamide and repeated Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a young adult with no medical history or previous symptoms who presents with severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks. The patient has no localizing signs on neurologic examination, and MRI of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head are unremarkable. The lumbar puncture shows 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes), and results of syphilis serologic tests are negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis.

At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity is 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There is no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination is within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination shows numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole. Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes viral meningitis, optic neuritis, and posterior uveitis. Viral meningitis is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks. However, the patient's MRI of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head are unremarkable, and the lumbar puncture shows 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes), which are not consistent with viral meningitis. Optic neuritis is another possible diagnosis, but the patient does not have any localizing signs on neurologic examination, and the anterior segment examination is within normal limits. Posterior uveitis is also a possible diagnosis, but the patient's fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes, which are not consistent with posterior uveitis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to send for infectious and inflammatory tests, begin oral prednisone therapy, and follow up in 1 week. The infectious and inflammatory tests will help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's presentation, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and sarcoidosis. Oral prednisone therapy will help to reduce inflammation and improve the patient's vision. Follow-up in 1 week will allow the clinician to assess the patient's response to treatment and make further management decisions.

**Answer:**
B: Send for infectious and inflammatory tests, begin oral prednisone therapy, and follow up in 1 week

Title: Anuric Kidney Failure in a Patient With Metastatic Melanoma Case is: A 53-year-old man received a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma with metastatic disease to the spine and brain 3 months before presentation. Four weeks following receipt of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, he developed acute abdominal pain in the setting of a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase levels, prompting hospital admission. Imaging results showed mild disease progression (new ascites and periportal metabolic lymph node). Splenic infarct and portal/splenic vein thrombi were identified as etiologies of his acute pain and were presumed to be secondary to hypercoagulable state of malignancy.Over the next 3 days, he had rising serum creatinine (sCr) levels (baseline, approximately 1 mg/dL [to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). The initial workup included ultrasonography and urinalysis. Ultrasonography results showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed.Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued. He continued to show gradual improvement, with a return to near baseline kidney function (sCr level, 1.3 mg/dL) approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation.Histopathology (original magnification x40) of kidney capillaries with hematoxylin and eosin stain showing atypical cells (arrowheads) (A), tubules with hematoxylin and eosin stain (B), and capillaries with melanin-A (C).Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasisWhat Is Your Diagnosis?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presented with anuric kidney failure 4 weeks after receiving immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab. The initial workup showed abnormal intraparenchymal flow to both kidneys without evidence of kidney artery stenosis. Urine studies were consistent with prerenal etiology, while the presence of casts suggested acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed.

Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis. The biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis with evidence of melanoma cells in the tubules.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis. This is supported by the patient's history of metastatic melanoma, the presence of melanoma cells in the kidney biopsy, and the lack of other causes of acute kidney injury.

Title: Soft Palate Ulcer—Benign or Malignant? Case is: A 71-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes presented to the otolaryngology team with 6 weeks’ history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. He also complained of nasal regurgitation. He denied having any systemic symptoms. He took linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. He was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol.Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal.Results of laboratory investigations, including lactate dehydrogenase level and autoimmune antibody tests, such as antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, were negative. Screening test results for HIV and Treponema pallidum were also negative. The only positive result was immunoglobulin (Ig) G for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The IgM for EBV was not detected.Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck on short tau inversion recovery sequence confirmed the soft palate defect but also showed some thickening and hyperenhancement around the edges of the defect. There was no demonstrable nasopharyngeal mass. The hard palate was intact, and there were no significant cervical lymph nodes. The patient had biopsies taken from the ulcers and edges of the soft palate defect.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The patient had biopsies taken from the ulcers and edges of the soft palate defect.

The most likely diagnosis is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer. This is a rare condition that is most commonly seen in children and young adults. It is characterized by the development of multiple ulcers on the skin and mucous membranes. The ulcers are usually painful and may last for several weeks. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory tests, such as a blood test for EBV antibodies.

There is no specific treatment for EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment may include medications such as analgesics and antibiotics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the ulcers.

The prognosis for EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer is generally good. The ulcers usually heal without any scarring. However, the condition can recur in some cases.

Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Blau syndrome. Blau syndrome is a rare, multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by ichthyosiform rash, arthritis, uveitis, and granulomatous inflammation of the lungs, liver, and kidneys. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the protein pyridinoline 5′-nucleotidase (PNPT1). PNPT1 is an enzyme that is involved in the degradation of pyridinoline, a byproduct of collagen breakdown. Mutations in PNPT1 lead to the accumulation of pyridinoline in the skin, joints, and other organs, which causes the characteristic features of Blau syndrome.

Answer not available
Reasoning: The patient presents with a 4-year history of generalized erythematous rashes, ichthyosiform brownish plaques on his lower extremities, and multiple erythematous confluent papules and plaques on his trunk and face. He also has a history of painful distal and proximal interphalangeal joints for 2 years, and uveitis in both eyes. Microscopic examination of his hair shows no trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa. A skin biopsy specimen reveals multiple circumscribed nests of granulomas that are infiltrating the dermis and subcutis. Histologic findings show noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and neutrophil infiltration in the dermis and subcutis.

The most likely diagnosis is Blau syndrome. Blau syndrome is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by ichthyosis, arthritis, uveitis, and granulomatous inflammation of the skin, lungs, and other organs. The disease is caused by mutations in the BPAN gene, which encodes a protein called beclin 1. Beclin 1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process that is essential for cell survival. Mutations in BPAN lead to defects in autophagy, which results in the accumulation of damaged cells and the development of inflammation and granulomas.

The clinical features of Blau syndrome are highly variable. Some patients may have only mild skin involvement, while others may have severe arthritis, uveitis, and lung disease. The disease is progressive, and there is no cure. Treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications.

Title: A Woman in Her 70s With Hypotension, Diffuse ST-Elevation, Murmurs, and an Intracardiac Mass Case is: A previously healthy woman in her early 70s was referred to our emergency department with exertional dyspnea. She reported recent physical and emotional stress from work and dizziness 2 days prior to presentation. She denied fever or palpitations. Her blood pressure was 84/59 mm Hg. A harmonic, musical systolic murmur was heard at the left third intercostal space. An electrocardiogram (ECG; Figure 1A) showed diffuse ST-segment elevation, most prominently in the anterior precordial leads. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of troponin (1.33 ng/mL; normal range: ≤0.016 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), brain natriuretic peptide (376.5 pg/mL; normal range: ≤18.4 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]), creatinine phosphokinase (96 U/L; normal range: 41-153 U/L), and D-dimer (0.68 μg/mL; normal range: ≤1.00 μg/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476]). Echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) wall-motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments and an LV apical mass with protruding features. Noncontrast computed tomography confirmed the high-density LV mass (Figure 1B). Coronary angiography revealed mild to moderate coronary atherosclerosis without obstructive coronary artery disease.Noncontrast computed tomography and electrocardiogram obtained on initial admission to the emergency department. A, Electrocardiogram showing diffuse ST-segment elevation with ST depression in aVR and T-wave inversion in leads V1 to V5, with a QTc interval of 494 milliseconds.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is presenting with diffuse ST-segment elevation, murmurs, and an intracardiac mass. This is concerning for a ventricular arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to the arrhythmia, as well as her cardiac dysfunction. Dobutamine is a positive inotropic agent that can increase cardiac output and blood pressure. However, it is contraindicated in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, as it can worsen the arrhythmia. Nitrates and nifedipine are vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. However, they are also contraindicated in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, as they can worsen the arrhythmia. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that can decrease heart rate and myocardial contractility. This may be beneficial in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, as it can decrease the risk of recurrence. However, bisoprolol is not a first-line agent for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. An intra-aortic balloon pump is a device that can be inserted into the aorta to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. It is a life-saving treatment for patients with cardiogenic shock. In this case, the patient is presenting with hypotension and cardiac dysfunction. She is at high risk for cardiogenic shock. An intra-aortic balloon pump is the most appropriate treatment for this patient.

Title: White Macula After Pars Plana Vitrectomy in a 71-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 71-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving maintenance obinutuzumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) infusions underwent uneventful pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye for vitreomacular traction. Diluted triamcinolone acetonide (TA) was used to stain the posterior hyaloid. After removal of 25-gauge trocar cannulas, subconjunctival TA and ceftazidime was injected. Owing to cystoid changes in the central macula, a short-acting gas tamponade with sulfur hexafluoride was used to tamponade any cystoid abnormalities that may have been unroofed. Despite unremarkable postoperative day 1 (POD1) examination findings, the patient presented on postoperative week 3 with a painless central scotoma and worsening floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/400 OD and intraocular pressure was normal. There was no external hyperemia or chemosis, and the anterior chamber was deep and quiet with no cells or flare.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is concerning for endophthalmitis, a serious infection of the eye that can lead to blindness. Intravitreal antibiotics are the standard of care for endophthalmitis, and should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis. Reviewing the medical records to see if gentamicin was given intraoperatively is also important, as gentamicin is a common cause of endophthalmitis after vitrectomy. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with an embolic stroke, and there is no indication that she requires urgent referral to the emergency department. Finally, valganciclovir hydrochloride is a medication used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is a rare complication of vitrectomy. Given the patient's age and history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, CMV infection is a possibility, but it is not the most likely diagnosis.

Title: Nonclearing Corneal Edema After Phacoemulsification and Intraocular Lens Implantation Case is: An 82-year-old man with an ocular history significant for bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts presented to the Cornea Service at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida, with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction 8 weeks earlier. Current ophthalmic medications included topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, in the right eye 6 times per day. The patient reported no improvement with the treatment. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive without relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. A slitlamp biomicroscopic examination of the right eye revealed grade 2 to 3 diffuse central corneal edema and folds (Figure 1). The anterior chamber was deep and the posterior chamber intraocular lens was in good position within the capsular bag. Although the view to the posterior pole of the right eye was hazy owing to corneal edema, dilated fundus examination findings were unremarkable. Examination of the left eye revealed a few guttate. The central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry was 957 μm in the right eye and 547 μm in the left eye.Slitlamp biomicroscopic photographs of the right eye show central corneal edema with diffuse illumination (A) and with slitbeam illumination (B).Provide medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 monthsPerform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty)What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has non-clearing corneal edema after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. The edema has been present for 8 weeks and has not responded to medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/80 in the right eye.

The next step in management is to obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram (AS-OCT) to assess the status of the corneal endothelium. The AS-OCT will help to determine the cause of the corneal edema and to guide further management.

If the AS-OCT shows that the corneal endothelium is damaged, then the patient may need to undergo an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty). This is a surgical procedure that replaces the damaged corneal endothelium with healthy endothelium from a donor cornea.

Title: Unilateral Frosted Branch Angiitis in a Patient With Immunosuppression Case is: A 49-year-old African American man who was hospitalized with hypervolemia due to supraventricular tachycardia presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss. His active medical problems included atrial flutter on anticoagulation, antisynthetase syndrome (which was diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase), fever with negative infectious workup results, and interstitial lung disease that was managed with azathioprine. Two weeks before the onset of sudden vision loss, the patient developed a rapidly evolving purpuric rash on his hands and feet that progressed to digital ischemia (Figure 1A). He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, which was completed 3 days before the onset of loss of vision and transitioned to treatment with azathioprine, 150 mg, and prednisone, 80 mg, that he was taking at the time of his vision loss.Cutaneous and retinal vasculitis. A, Purpuric rash involving the left foot. B, Montage fundus photograph of the left eye shows frosted branch angiitis with preretinal hemorrhages over the disc (arrowhead) and macula (arrowhead), intraretinal hemorrhages, perivenular exudates, and sheathing.On ophthalmic examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and hand motions OS (baseline from 2 weeks prior was 20/20 OU), with a briskly reactive right pupil and a left afferent pupillary defect. Left eye examination revealed 2 or more anterior chamber cells, preretinal hemorrhage, frosted branch angiitis with diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages, and perivascular exudates (Figure 1B). Fluorescein angiography results revealed extensive vascular nonperfusion and late perivenular leakage. The right eye was normal.Laboratory workup results revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 85 mm per hour, C-reactive protein levels of 2.53 mg/dL (to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies test result, antinuclear antibodies, cryoglobulins, syphilis serology, tuberculosis testing, and transthoracic echocardiogram. Skin biopsy results showed medium vessel vasculitis.What Would You Do Next? A: Escalate systemic immunosuppression , B: Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet , C: Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry , D: Whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient has a history of antisynthetase syndrome, which is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause a variety of organ system involvement, including the eyes. The patient's presentation with acute unilateral painless vision loss, a purpuric rash, and fever is concerning for a vasculitis. The patient's laboratory workup is consistent with a vasculitis, with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. The skin biopsy results showed medium vessel vasculitis.

The most likely diagnosis is a systemic vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa or Wegener's granulomatosis. The next step in management is to escalate systemic immunosuppression. This may include a combination of high-dose corticosteroids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, and other immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.

Serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (279 U/L, normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]). Biopsies from skin nodules and bone marrow were obtained.

The histologic findings of the skin biopsy show diffuse dermal infiltrates, extending to the subcutis, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis. The infiltrates are characterized by immature myeloid cells. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma.

Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is a rare, aggressive form of cutaneous myeloid sarcoma that is characterized by the presence of immature myeloid cells in the skin. It is most commonly seen in adults, with a median age of presentation of 45 years. The most common presenting symptom is a rapidly growing, painless skin nodule. Other symptoms may include fever, chills, fatigue, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is made on the basis of a skin biopsy. The treatment of aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is with chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is poor, with a median survival of only 12 months.

Title: An Enlarging Parotid Mass in a 9-Year-Old Boy Case is: A 9-year-old boy was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a 3-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass had been slowly enlarging and he had been experiencing mild intermittent pain, but no additional symptoms were reported. His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis. Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma (Figure, A).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 9-year-old boy with a 3-month history of a left-sided parotid mass. The mass is slowly enlarging and he has been experiencing mild intermittent pain. His medical history is significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination shows a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass.

Gross examination of the specimen demonstrated a 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.1–cm tan-white, well-circumscribed lesion that was partially surrounded by salivary gland parenchyma. Histologic examination of the nodule showed a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change. Acinar cells with brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules were also noted.

The differential diagnosis for a parotid mass includes benign and malignant lesions. Benign lesions include pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin tumor, and acinic cell carcinoma. Malignant lesions include adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a benign parotid mass. The mass is slowly enlarging, there is no lymphadenopathy, and cranial nerve VII is fully intact. The ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a well-circumscribed, non-enhancing mass, which is also consistent with a benign lesion. The fine needle aspiration biopsy showed benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells, which is also consistent with a benign lesion.

The histologic findings of the excised parotid mass show a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change. Acinar cells with brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules are also noted. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sclerosing polycystic adenoma.

Sclerosing polycystic adenoma is a rare, benign salivary gland tumor that typically occurs in adults. It is characterized by a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change. Acinar cells with brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules are also noted. The tumor is usually asymptomatic, but it can occasionally cause pain or facial nerve palsy. Treatment is surgical excision.

Results of polarized light examination and periodic acid–Schiff, Ziehl–Neelsen, Giemsa, Gram, and Grocott methenamine silver stains were negative for microorganisms.

The most likely diagnosis is lupus vulgaris. Lupus vulgaris is a chronic, progressive, granulomatous skin disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in the skin. The granulomas are composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and Langhans giant cells. The disease typically affects the face, ears, and upper extremities.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with lupus vulgaris. She has a long history of a slowly progressive, granulomatous skin lesion on the right auricle. The lesion is associated with foul-smelling otorrhea, which is a common finding in lupus vulgaris. The histopathologic findings of the lesion are also consistent with lupus vulgaris. The presence of noncaseating granulomas in the skin, with histiocytes, lymphocytes, and Langhans giant cells, is characteristic of the disease.

The differential diagnosis of lupus vulgaris includes a number of other granulomatous skin diseases, such as sarcoidosis, granuloma annulare, and foreign body granulomas. However, the clinical features and histopathologic findings in this case are most consistent with lupus vulgaris.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a teenage girl with a history of recurrent episodes of chest and neck palpitations accompanied by headaches. The symptoms have been present for 3 years and are characterized by sudden onset and offset. The patient has no specific medical or family history and has not been treated for her symptoms.

The physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography results are normal. The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) while symptomatic shows a wide QRS complex rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute. After a short walk, the symptoms disappear and another ECG is recorded, which shows a normal sinus rhythm.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)
* Ventricular tachycardia (VT)
* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)
* Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is SVT. SVT is a common arrhythmia that occurs in young adults. It is characterized by a rapid heart rate that is usually regular. The symptoms of SVT can vary depending on the patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and the rate of the arrhythmia. Common symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness.

The ECG findings in this patient are consistent with SVT. The wide QRS complex rhythm is due to a supraventricular impulse that is conducted down an abnormal pathway to the ventricles. This results in a ventricular rate that is faster than the normal sinus rate.

The treatment for SVT depends on the patient's symptoms and the underlying cause of the arrhythmia. In some cases, SVT may resolve on its own. In other cases, it may be necessary to treat the arrhythmia with medication or electrical cardioversion.

In this patient, the most appropriate management strategy is therapeutic abstention and patient reassurance. The patient is young and healthy, and her symptoms are mild. The ECG findings are consistent with SVT, which is a benign arrhythmia that is unlikely to cause serious problems. In most cases, SVT will resolve on its own. If the patient's symptoms do not resolve or if they become more severe, then it may be necessary to treat the arrhythmia with medication or electrical cardioversion.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, and colon adenocarcinoma resected 10 years prior. She is currently taking prednisolone and levothyroxine. She presents with 2 months of diarrhea and 2 weeks of rash. She has no fever, night sweats, or abdominal pain. On examination, she is afebrile, with blood pressure 90/46 mm Hg; pulse, 90/min and regular; and respirations, 18/min. Body mass index is 16.8 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). She is alert, cognitively intact, and appears emaciated. Glossitis and a scaly pruritic rash with an erythematous brawny peeling base on her neck and extremities were noted. Laboratory studies showed mild hyponatremia (132 mmol/L) and an otherwise normal basic metabolic panel. Other laboratory values were as follows: C-reactive protein, 0.58 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 23 mm/h; total protein, 4.8 g/dL; and albumin, 1.8 g/dL. Her white blood cell count was 7200/μL (66.5% neutrophils, 30.4% lymphocytes); hemoglobin level, 9.9 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 96 fL; and platelet count, 332 000/μL. Results of liver function tests, coagulation tests, urinalysis, thyroid function tests, measurement of serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levels, and cosyntropin stimulation tests were normal. Serum copper level was 46 μg (reference range, 66-130 μg) and zinc level was 23 μg (reference, ≥80 μg). Abdominal computed tomography revealed no abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis is malabsorption syndrome. This is supported by the patient's history of diarrhea, rash, glossitis, and weight loss. The laboratory findings of hyponatremia, low serum albumin, and low serum copper are also consistent with malabsorption.

The next step in the evaluation is to measure fecal calprotectin level. Fecal calprotectin is a protein that is released by neutrophils in the gut. It is a sensitive and specific marker of intestinal inflammation. A high fecal calprotectin level would support the diagnosis of malabsorption syndrome.

The other options are not as likely in this case. Fecal ova and parasites should be checked in patients with diarrhea who have traveled to an area where parasitic infections are common. Serum niacin level should be checked in patients with pellagra, which is a condition that is caused by niacin deficiency. Serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody should be checked in patients with celiac disease, which is an autoimmune condition that damages the small intestine.

Title: A Nonhealing Epithelial Defect in a Patient Experiencing Alcohol Use Disorder Case is: A 50-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heroin use, and alcohol use disorder presented with a new epithelial defect in the setting of a healing right corneal ulcer. Six days prior, he had presented with an inferior stromal infiltrate with an overlying epithelial defect, diffuse corneal edema, and a small hypopyon with no hemorrhage in the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). He also had patchy iris hemorrhages with no transillumination defects and areas of conjunctival ulceration nasally and temporally. He denied contact lens use. Given these findings, a presumed herpes zoster sine herpete1 with secondary bacterial infection was suspected. Treatment with hourly topical vancomycin at 14 mg/mL and tobramycin at 25 mg/mL, as well as 1000 mg of oral valacyclovir 3 times a day, was initiated. Corneal cultures grew Streptococcus pneumonia. He initially responded well with improvement of the stromal infiltrate and overlying epithelial defect. However, on day 6 of treatment, he had a new larger epithelial defect and subepithelial bullae in an adjacent location but no infiltrate. While evaluating the new defect, the patient was also noted to have dull conjunctival reflexes and bulbar conjunctival lesions in both eyes (Figure 1B). Additionally, both eyes had patchy interpalpebral results on lissamine green staining of the conjunctiva and clinically significant punctate epithelial erosions of the cornea with fluorescein staining.What Would You Do Next?

Additionally, both eyes had patchy interpalpebral results on lissamine green staining of the conjunctiva and clinically significant punctate epithelial erosions of the cornea with fluorescein staining.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests. These tests are used to screen for Sjögren's syndrome, a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the eyes, salivary glands, and other organs. Sjögren's syndrome can cause a variety of eye problems, including dry eyes, corneal ulcers, and uveitis. In the setting of a nonhealing corneal ulcer, it is important to rule out Sjögren's syndrome as a possible cause.

Reasoning:
Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the eyes, salivary glands, and other organs. It is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against antigens in the salivary glands and lacrimal glands. These autoantibodies can lead to inflammation and damage to the glands, resulting in dry eyes, dry mouth, and other symptoms.

Sjögren's syndrome can also affect the eyes in other ways. The inflammation associated with the disease can damage the cornea, leading to corneal ulcers. Uveitis, an inflammation of the uveal tract (the middle layer of the eye), is also a common complication of Sjögren's syndrome.

In the setting of a nonhealing corneal ulcer, it is important to rule out Sjögren's syndrome as a possible cause. This can be done by obtaining serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests. These tests are used to screen for the presence of autoantibodies against Ro and La antigens. The presence of these autoantibodies is highly suggestive of Sjögren's syndrome.

If Sjögren's syndrome is diagnosed, treatment will focus on relieving the symptoms of the disease and preventing complications. Treatment may include artificial tears, oral or topical medications to stimulate saliva production, and immunosuppressive medications to reduce inflammation.

Title: Bilateral Enlargement of All Extraocular Muscles Case is: A 64-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of progressive bilateral proptosis and conjunctival erythema. Her medical history was significant for hypothyroidism, treated with levothyroxine, as well as 2 forms of hematologic malignancy: retroperitoneal extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and indolent-phase T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. She had received no treatment for her hematologic malignancies, as she had been asymptomatic since her diagnoses 6 years prior.Ophthalmological examination revealed 27 mm of bilateral proptosis, conjunctival injection, chemosis, and bilateral lower eyelid retraction (Figure 1A).1 Visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary responses were normal. Extraocular motility was full in all positions of gaze, and there was no associated pain. Upper eyelid retraction was minimal. Von Graefe sign (delayed descent of the upper eyelid with initiation of downgaze) and lagophthalmos were absent. Results of slitlamp examination and dilated fundus examination were normal, including the appearance of both optic nerves.A, Clinical photograph at presentation; bilateral proptosis, lower eyelid retraction, chemosis, and conjunctival injection are present. There is mild temporal retraction of both upper eyelids. B, Radiographic images documenting marked enlargement of all extraocular muscles bilaterally. The lateral rectus is especially enlarged on both sides. Using a measurement technique described by Dagi and colleagues,1 the maximal diameter of each extraocular muscle in this patient was as follows: right inferior rectus, 8.0 mm; right medial rectus, 9.1 mm; right superior muscle group, 9.7 mm; right lateral rectus, 9.3 mm; left inferior rectus, 8.1 mm; left medial rectus, 9.5 mm; left superior muscle group, 10.0 mm; and left lateral rectus, 9.6 mm. There is sparing of anterior tendinous insertions (arrowheads) of each medial rectus (MR) and lateral rectus (LR). However, the anterior portion of the muscle belly (brackets) appears uninvolved compared with the posterior portion, causing an acute taper of the muscle that is similar in shape to an amphora (inset).An orbital computed tomography scan revealed marked enlargement of all extraocular muscles (Figure 1B). Thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels were normal. Test results for autoimmune diseases, including sarcoidosis, Sjogren syndrome, granulomatous polyangiitis, IgG4 disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasculitis, were negative.What Would You Do Next? A: Prescribe high-dose intravenous steroids , B: Perform staged bilateral orbital decompressions , C: Perform extraocular muscle biopsy , D: Refer for bilateral orbital external beam radiation.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism, retroperitoneal extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, and indolent-phase T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. She presents with a 6-month history of progressive bilateral proptosis and conjunctival erythema. The physical examination reveals 27 mm of bilateral proptosis, conjunctival injection, chemosis, and bilateral lower eyelid retraction. The ocular motility is full in all positions of gaze, and there is no associated pain. The upper eyelid retraction is minimal. Von Graefe sign (delayed descent of the upper eyelid with initiation of downgaze) and lagophthalmos are absent. The results of the slitlamp examination and dilated fundus examination are normal, including the appearance of both optic nerves. The orbital computed tomography scan reveals marked enlargement of all extraocular muscles. The thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels are normal. Test results for autoimmune diseases, including sarcoidosis, Sjogren syndrome, granulomatous polyangiitis, IgG4 disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasculitis, are negative.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Graves' orbitopathy. Graves' orbitopathy is an autoimmune disease that affects the muscles and tissues around the eyes. It is the most common cause of bilateral proptosis in adults. The diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy is based on the clinical presentation, including the history, physical examination, and imaging findings. There is no single laboratory test that is diagnostic of Graves' orbitopathy.

The treatment of Graves' orbitopathy is aimed at reducing the inflammation and swelling around the eyes. This can be done with medications, such as steroids, or with surgery. In some cases, a combination of medications and surgery is necessary.

In the case of this patient, the next step in management would be to start her on a course of high-dose intravenous steroids. This would help to reduce the inflammation and swelling around her eyes. After a few weeks of treatment, she would be re-evaluated and a decision would be made about whether or not she would need surgery.

Title: Worsening Floaters in a 68-Year-Old White Woman Case is: A 68-year-old white woman was referred for worsening floaters in both eyes starting 2 years before presentation. Her medical history included hypertension and right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. On examination, her visual acuity with habitual correction had decreased to 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS from 20/30 OU 2 years prior. A slitlamp examination revealed normal conjunctivae, nuclear sclerosis cataracts in both eyes, and deep and quiet anterior chambers. On a dilated fundus examination, there was 2+ vitreous cell and floaters in both eyes and a blonde fundus in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography imaging confirmed cystoid macular edema (CME) in both eyes; the right eye had cystoid spaces in the inner nuclear, outer plexiform, and outer nuclear layers, and the left eye had small cystoid spaces in the inner nuclear layer (Figure, A and B). Fluorescein angiography showed leakage of the optic nerve in the right eye, with petaloid leakage in the macular right eye worse than in the left eye. A uveitis workup had unremarkable or negative results for a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood cell count with a differential, Quantiferon gold test, Lyme antibody tests, an angiotensin-converting enzyme level, a serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and chest radiography. Additionally, 4 months prior, the patient developed trigeminal neuralgia, with a magnetic resonance image with contrast of the brain revealing an enhancing mass in the right middle cranial fossa, extending into the Meckel cave and abutting the right trigeminal nerve (Figure, C).A, Optical coherence tomography (OCT) image showing the right eye had cystoid spaces in the inner nuclear, outer plexiform, and outer nuclear layers.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 68-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. She presents with worsening floaters in both eyes that started 2 years ago. Her visual acuity has decreased from 20/30 OU to 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. On examination, there is 2+ vitreous cell and floaters in both eyes, and a blonde fundus in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography imaging confirms cystoid macular edema (CME) in both eyes; the right eye had cystoid spaces in the inner nuclear, outer plexiform, and outer nuclear layers, and the left eye had small cystoid spaces in the inner nuclear layer. Fluorescein angiography showed leakage of the optic nerve in the right eye, with petaloid leakage in the macular right eye worse than in the left eye. A uveitis workup was unremarkable or negative. Additionally, 4 months prior, the patient developed trigeminal neuralgia, with a magnetic resonance image with contrast of the brain revealing an enhancing mass in the right middle cranial fossa, extending into the Meckel cave and abutting the right trigeminal nerve.

The most likely diagnosis is a meningioma. Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor, accounting for 30% of all intracranial tumors. They are typically benign tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, seizures, visual disturbances, and cranial nerve palsies. The diagnosis of meningioma is usually made with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain.

The treatment of meningioma depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Small, asymptomatic meningiomas may be observed without treatment. Larger tumors or tumors that are causing symptoms may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient has a large, enhancing mass in the right middle cranial fossa, extending into the Meckel cave and abutting the right trigeminal nerve. This mass is highly suspicious for a meningioma. The patient is also experiencing worsening floaters in both eyes, which is a common symptom of meningioma. Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a meningioma.

The next step in the management of this patient is to recommend a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the tumor and will also provide information about the grade of the tumor, which will help to determine the best course of treatment.

Title: Orbital Swelling in a Child With Retinoblastoma Following Intra-arterial Chemotherapy Case is: A 9-month-old girl presented to the emergency department with significant left periocular edema and erythema 3 days after receiving intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with 0.4 mg/kg of melphalan, 50 mg of carboplatin, and 2 mg of topotecan (with routine intravenous dexamethasone therapy, 0.5 mg/kg) for treatment of unilateral International Classification of Retinoblastoma group C retinoblastoma in the left eye (Figure, A). At the time of IAC, she had an upper respiratory tract infection (coughing, congestion, rhinorrhea, fever [temperature of 38.9 °C]). On postoperative day 1, her temperature reached 39.4 °C, and she was diagnosed as having bilateral acute otitis media and discharged with amoxicillin therapy. On postoperative day 3, she returned to the emergency department with left eye swelling, continued fever, and poor oral intake. On physical examination, her temperature was 40.2 °C, and periorbital swelling and erythema were present without drainage. Dilated fundus examination at the bedside showed the known large retinoblastoma tumor. A large exudative retinal detachment was noted, which was not present prior to treatment. Blood bacterial culture testing showed no growth, respiratory viral testing revealed rhinovirus, and results of comprehensive metabolic testing were unremarkable. Complete blood cell count showed mild leukopenia (2700/μL [to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001]) and anemia (hemoglobin, 9.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but were otherwise within reference ranges. Computed tomography scan of the orbits, recommended by the on-call general ophthalmologist, demonstrated preseptal and periorbital soft tissue swelling and edema with subtle retrobulbar stranding, without substantial proptosis, along with retinal detachment (Figure, B). She was admitted for intravenous fluids for her noted dehydration.A, Clinical appearance of the child on presentation, showing unilateral periorbital swelling and erythema.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 9-month-old girl with a history of retinoblastoma who presented with significant left periocular edema and erythema 3 days after receiving intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC). The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for orbital cellulitis, which is a serious infection of the tissues around the eye that can lead to vision loss and death if not treated promptly. The patient's fever, periorbital swelling, and erythema are all classic signs of orbital cellulitis. The patient's computed tomography scan of the orbits shows evidence of preseptal and periorbital soft tissue swelling and edema with subtle retrobulbar stranding, which is also consistent with orbital cellulitis.

The most important initial step in the management of orbital cellulitis is to establish intravenous access and begin empiric antibiotic therapy. The most common organisms that cause orbital cellulitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover these organisms. A reasonable regimen would be intravenous vancomycin and cefepime.

Once the patient is stabilized, it is important to perform a thorough ophthalmologic examination to assess the extent of the infection and to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as an orbital foreign body or an orbital tumor. If the patient's ophthalmologic examination is normal, then the patient may be able to be discharged home with oral antibiotics. However, if the patient's ophthalmologic examination is abnormal, then the patient may need to be admitted to the hospital for further management.

Title: Red Plaques in a Pediatric Patient With Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage Case is: A 16-year-old boy with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. Previously, he had been well, with morphological remission found on a recent bone marrow biopsy. The patient had no significant dermatological history, except an allergy to cashew nuts and a prior episode (6 mo) of urticaria during a platelet transfusion that had resolved with 1 dose of oral antihistamine. The patient’s medications included ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone (supportive care initiated with chemotherapy), and long-term posaconazole and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment.Lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours (Figure, A and B). The patient developed a fever, which we extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.A and B, Clinical images showing erythematous plaques and nodules on patient’s palm and forearm. C, Hematoxylin-eosin–stained specimen showing leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in deeper dermis, around appendage structures and coiled eccrine glands, and into the interstitium.The results of a complete examination of blood drawn at lesion onset demonstrated a total white cell count of 6330/μL (to convert to 109/L multiply by 0.001) with absolute neutrophil count of 6140/μL, more than the previous day’s counts of 3210/μL and 1720/μL, respectively. The blood film demonstrated increased neutrophil granulation with a left shift. A punch biopsy from the upper arm was performed (Figure, C).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Sweet syndrome , B: Urticaria , C: Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis , D: Leukemia cutis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 16-year-old boy with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage who developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. The lesions were initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, and progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours. The patient developed a fever, which was thought to be secondary to cytarabine. A complete blood count showed a total white cell count of 6330/μL with absolute neutrophil count of 6140/μL. The blood film demonstrated increased neutrophil granulation with a left shift. A punch biopsy from the upper arm showed a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in deeper dermis, around appendage structures and coiled eccrine glands, and into the interstitium.

The differential diagnosis includes Sweet syndrome, urticaria, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, and leukemia cutis. Sweet syndrome is a febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that typically presents with tender, erythematous plaques and nodules on the face, neck, and upper extremities. Urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by transient wheals (hives). Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the eccrine sweat glands that presents with tender, erythematous nodules and plaques, typically on the axillae and groin. Leukemia cutis is a rare skin manifestation of leukemia that presents with papules, nodules, or tumors on the skin.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. The patient's fever and tender, erythematous plaques and nodules on the face, neck, and upper extremities are typical of Sweet syndrome. The patient's complete blood count showed a leukocytosis with a left shift, which is also consistent with Sweet syndrome. The punch biopsy showed a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis, which is the characteristic histopathologic finding of Sweet syndrome.

Urticaria is less likely in this patient because the patient's lesions are not transient wheals. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is less likely in this patient because the patient's lesions are not limited to the axillae and groin. Leukemia cutis is less likely in this patient because the patient's lesions are not papules, nodules, or tumors.

Title: Spontaneous Cervical Swelling Case is: A 56-year-old patient with no medical history presented spontaneously to the emergency department of our university hospital (Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris) for bilateral neck swelling that had developed over 24 hours. The patient had no traumatic or iatrogenic triggers. He reported an edema of the lower lip that resolved spontaneously the day before. He had no dyspnea nor dysphagia, but did have a discrete dysphonia. He had no fever. Neck swelling was global, bilateral, and painless, and was most severe on the left side. There was a rash, the border of which was marked with a felt pen. Nasofibroscopy results showed a normal airway with a posterior pharyngeal wall bulging. Oropharyngeal and oral cavity examination results were normal, with no trismus.A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large retropharyngeal fluid accumulation of 2 × 10 × 6 cm that extended laterally to the vascular spaces, especially on the left side (Figure, A and B).

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 56-year-old man with no medical history who presented with bilateral neck swelling that had developed over 24 hours. He had no traumatic or iatrogenic triggers. He reported an edema of the lower lip that resolved spontaneously the day before. He had no dyspnea nor dysphagia, but did have a discrete dysphonia. He had no fever. Neck swelling was global, bilateral, and painless, and was most severe on the left side. There was a rash, the border of which was marked with a felt pen. Nasofibroscopy results showed a normal airway with a posterior pharyngeal wall bulging. Oropharyngeal and oral cavity examination results were normal, with no trismus. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large retropharyngeal fluid accumulation of 2 × 10 × 6 cm that extended laterally to the vascular spaces, especially on the left side. This was associated with infiltration of the mediastinal fat and a thin left pleural effusion. There was no vascular thrombosis or dental abnormality. Hyperleukocytosis levels were 12 000/mL. We did not have the result of the C reactive protein assay.

The differential diagnosis for neck swelling includes a variety of conditions, including infections, neoplasms, and inflammatory disorders. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of angioneurotic edema. Angioneurotic edema is a type of allergic reaction that is characterized by sudden swelling of the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. It is most commonly caused by an allergic reaction to food, drugs, or insect stings. The swelling is caused by the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells.

The patient's history of lower lip edema that resolved spontaneously the day before is consistent with an allergic reaction. The bilateral neck swelling, which is most severe on the left side, is also consistent with angioneurotic edema. The rash that is present on the patient's neck is also a common finding in patients with angioneurotic edema.

The CT scan findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of angioneurotic edema. The retropharyngeal fluid accumulation that is seen on the CT scan is a result of the swelling of the soft tissues in the neck. The infiltration of the mediastinal fat and the thin left pleural effusion are also consistent with an allergic reaction.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of angioneurotic edema. The hyperleukocytosis is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions, including allergic reactions. The C reactive protein assay is not routinely performed in patients with angioneurotic edema.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of angioneurotic edema.

Title: Acute Airway Obstruction in a Patient Being Treated With Anticoagulation Therapy Case is: A 71-year-old man presented to the emergency department with dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling. He denied chills, fever, neck stiffness, new medications, otalgia, sick contacts, trismus, and use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. His complex medical history included factor V Leiden deficiency requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, heart failure with atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with 110-pack-year smoking history. Laboratory studies demonstrated an international normalized ratio of 16.4, a prothrombin time of 118.1 seconds, and a partial thromboplastin time of 81.4 seconds. On examination, the patient had substantial dysphonia, fullness in the left submandibular region, and ecchymosis of the lateral left neck extending toward the midline. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed in the emergency department revealed a large, intermediate-density, modestly enhancing, left-sided submucosal lesion extending from the nasopharynx inferiorly to the glottis with encroachment on the airway (Figure). Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated a large submucosal mass extending from the left posteroinferior nasopharyngeal wall to the left lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls, obstructing the view of the left supraglottis, glottis, and piriform sinus. The right side of the epiglottis was ecchymotic and edematous. The mass extended farther along the aryepiglottic fold to involve the arytenoid and interarytenoid space, as well as the false vocal fold on the left. The vocal cords were only partially visualized.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a complex medical history including factor V Leiden deficiency requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, heart failure with atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with 110-pack-year smoking history. He presents to the emergency department with dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling. He denies chills, fever, neck stiffness, new medications, otalgia, sick contacts, trismus, and use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

On examination, the patient has substantial dysphonia, fullness in the left submandibular region, and ecchymosis of the lateral left neck extending toward the midline. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed in the emergency department revealed a large, intermediate-density, modestly enhancing, left-sided submucosal lesion extending from the nasopharynx inferiorly to the glottis with encroachment on the airway. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated a large submucosal mass extending from the left posteroinferior nasopharyngeal wall to the left lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls, obstructing the view of the left supraglottis, glottis, and piriform sinus. The right side of the epiglottis was ecchymotic and edematous. The mass extended farther along the aryepiglottic fold to involve the arytenoid and interarytenoid space, as well as the false vocal fold on the left. The vocal cords were only partially visualized. Given the important laryngoscopy findings, the decision was made to proceed with awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation in the operating room to secure the patient’s airway.

The differential diagnosis for a large, submucosal, obstructive lesion of the upper airway includes abscess, head and neck malignant neoplasm(s), angioedema, and spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

An abscess is a localized collection of pus that can develop in any part of the body, including the upper airway. Abscesses are typically caused by infection with bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Patients with an abscess of the upper airway may present with fever, chills, pain, and swelling in the affected area. On examination, the area may be red, tender, and fluctuant. Abscesses of the upper airway can be life-threatening if they rupture and cause aspiration of pus into the lungs.

Head and neck malignant neoplasm(s) are a common cause of large, submucosal lesions of the upper airway. The most common types of head and neck cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma. Patients with head and neck cancer may present with a variety of symptoms, depending on the location of the tumor. Symptoms may include hoarseness, dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, facial pain, and neck mass. On examination, the patient may have a visible mass in the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, can help to determine the size, location, and extent of the tumor.

Angioedema is a sudden swelling of the skin and tissues that is caused by an allergic reaction. Angioedema can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the face, lips, tongue, and throat. Patients with angioedema may present with swelling, redness, and itching of the affected area. On examination, the area may be swollen, pale, and shiny. Angioedema can be life-threatening if it causes swelling of the airway.

Spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur in patients with underlying vascular disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Patients with spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma may present with sudden onset of dyspnea, stridor, and cyanosis. On examination, the patient may have a visible mass in the airway. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, can help to determine the size, location, and extent of the hematoma.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is a large, submucosal, obstructive lesion of the upper airway caused by angioedema. The patient's history of factor V Leiden deficiency requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, heart failure with atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with 110-pack-year smoking history places him at increased risk for developing angioedema. The patient's presentation with dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling is consistent with angioedema. The findings on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy are also consistent with angioedema.

Title: Follicular Papules in a Linear Distribution on a Child’s Face Case is: A girl younger than 2 years presented with a 1-year history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face. She was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and her growth and development were appropriate for her age. No associated symptoms such as fever, anorexia, or weight loss were noted. Physical examination revealed multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose. A small, excoriated plaque was also noted on the right malar area (Figure 1A). No mucosal lesions were present, and the rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. A complete hematological and biochemical survey, including blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid function, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, disclosed no abnormalities. Two skin punch biopsies were taken from the forehead and nose. Representative histopathological features are shown in Figure 1B and C.Multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules are seen coalescing into a linear plaque involving the patient’s forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose (A). Two skin punch biopsies were taken from the forehead and nose (B and C).What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is a young girl with a 1-year history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face. The lesions are distributed in a segmental pattern, which suggests a diagnosis of lichen striatus. Lichen striatus is a chronic, self-limited dermatosis that typically affects children. It is characterized by linear, erythematous, papular lesions that are often pruritic. The lesions are most commonly located on the extremities, but they can also occur on the trunk and face. The histopathology of lichen striatus shows perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and mucin deposition in the papillary dermis.

Title: Hypertrichotic Plaque in a 17-Month-Old Boy Case is: A 17-month-old boy was referred to pediatric dermatology for evaluation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back. The child's mother reported that, on discovery, the plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and had since grown in size with the child. She was uncertain if the plaque was present at birth. The patient’s medical history was significant for dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There was no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2.Physical examination revealed a well-appearing boy with normal vital signs and Fitzpatrick type III skin type. On the left lower back, there was a 15 × 5-cm indurated skin-colored to yellow, firm, multinodular plaque with hypertrichosis, extending from the midline to the left lower flank (Figure, A). There were additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination was within normal limits. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation (Figure, B-D).A, Large, well-defined, firm yellow to skin-colored multinodular hypertrichotic plaque on the left lower back.

**Reasoning:** The patient is a 17-month-old boy with a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back. The plaque was initially 1 × 1 cm and has since grown in size with the child. The patient also has a history of dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, increased head circumference (97th percentile), and expressive language delay. There is no family history of congenital birthmarks or neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2.

On physical examination, the patient has a well-defined, firm yellow to skin-colored multinodular hypertrichotic plaque on the left lower back. There are additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, as well as a small café au lait macule on the right lower back. Limited neurologic examination is within normal limits.

A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed for further diagnostic evaluation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrates diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells, predominantly encircling terminal folliculosebaceous units. Higher-power magnification highlights a mix of partially fusiform melanocytes and dendritic cells with glassy, eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining reveals diffuse and periadnexal S100 positivity in the mid to deep dermis.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Becker nevus, neurocristic hamartoma, smooth muscle hamartoma, and plexiform neurofibroma. Becker nevus is a congenital, unilateral, hyperpigmented macule with associated hypertrichosis. It is thought to be caused by a mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R). Neurocristic hamartoma is a benign, hamartomatous lesion of the peripheral nervous system that is composed of Schwann cells, melanocytes, and fibroblasts. It is often associated with café au lait macules and Lisch nodules. Smooth muscle hamartoma is a benign, hamartomatous lesion of the smooth muscle that is often associated with tuberous sclerosis. Plexiform neurofibroma is a benign, but locally aggressive, tumor of the peripheral nervous system that is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Becker nevus. This is supported by the patient's history of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back that was initially 1 × 1 cm and has since grown in size with the child. The patient also has a history of dermal melanocytosis of the right hip and mid back, which is a common finding in Becker nevus. The physical examination findings of a well-defined, firm yellow to skin-colored multinodular hypertrichotic plaque on the left lower back, as well as additional blue-gray patches on the back and right hip, are also consistent with Becker nevus. The histopathologic findings of diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells, predominantly encircling terminal folliculosebaceous units, and immunohistochemical staining revealing diffuse and periadnexal S100 positivity in the mid to deep dermis are also consistent with Becker nevus.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Becker nevus.

Title: Urgent Need for Diagnosis of a Rapidly Growing Right Atrial Mass Case is: A middle-aged man with no relevant medical history presented to the emergency department with progressive shortness of breath, a productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats for several months. A few days prior to presentation, he had developed palpitations, chest discomfort, and lower-extremity swelling. He denied taking any medications or recent international travel. In the emergency department, he had a normal blood pressure with an irregular heart rate at 104 beats per minute. On examination, he had bilateral basilar crackles and traces of lower extremity edema. An electrocardiogram revealed that he was experiencing atrial flutter. A computed tomographic angiogram showed an acute pulmonary embolism, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a right atrial mass. He then underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram with 2-dimensional speckle-tracking strain, which revealed a 4.5 × 3.6 × 3.1-cm pedunculated right atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum near the fossa ovalis (Figure 1A; Video). Left ventricular function was noted to be reduced and cardiac mechanics by 2-dimensional speckle-tracking strain were markedly abnormal, suggesting a more diffuse myocardial process (Figure 1B).A, Transthoracic echocardiogram image with 4-chamber view visualizing the right atrial mass measuring 4.5 × 3.6 × 3.1 cm.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient has a right atrial mass, which is a potentially serious condition. Further testing is needed to determine the nature of the mass and to assess the patient's risk of developing complications. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to evaluate a right atrial mass. It can provide detailed information about the size, shape, and location of the mass, as well as its tissue composition. This information is important for making a diagnosis and for planning treatment. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) is a less commonly used test that can also be used to evaluate a right atrial mass. However, PET–CT is not as accurate as MRI in determining the tissue composition of a mass. Right heart catheterization for biopsy is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into a vein in the leg and threaded up to the heart. A small piece of tissue from the right atrium is then removed for biopsy. This procedure can be used to determine the type of tissue that makes up the mass. However, it is a more invasive procedure than MRI or PET–CT, and it carries a small risk of complications. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a type of ultrasound that is performed from the esophagus. It can be used to evaluate the heart and other structures in the chest in more detail than a transthoracic echocardiogram. However, TEE is a more invasive procedure than transthoracic echocardiogram, and it carries a small risk of complications.

Title: A Purpuric Rash Case is: A 48-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and obstructive sleep apnea presented with a rash over his right foot accompanied by 1 week of episodic fever, diaphoresis, and headaches. Six weeks prior, he fell from a ladder and had right nondisplaced medial malleolar and comminuted talar fractures. The fractures were managed nonsurgically in a controlled ankle movement boot, with resolution of swelling and bruising. On current presentation, his temperature was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F); heart rate, 88/min; respiratory rate, 18/min; and blood pressure, 102/65 mm Hg. He was well appearing with normal cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. There was trace right lower extremity edema localized to the ankle and normal pedal pulses. Erythema without warmth was present over the right ankle and dorsomedial foot, along with nontender, nonpalpable purpura over the dorsum of the foot and scattered petechiae over the right lower leg (Figure). When the leg was elevated above the level of the heart, the surrounding erythema faded.Right lower extremity rash 2 days before admission (left) and at presentation (right).Results of laboratory testing were as follows: white blood cell count, 6000/μL; hemoglobin level, 13.7 mg/dL; platelet count, 118 000/μL; creatinine level, 1.3 mg/dL (114.95 μmol/L); prothrombin time, 15.2 seconds (reference range, 12.2-14.9 seconds); activated partial thromboplastin time, 41 seconds (reference range, 23.1-34.2 seconds); C-reactive protein level, 7 mg/dL (reference range, 0-1 mg/dL); and normal urinalysis results.Order antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levelsWhat Would You Do Next? A: Order skin biopsy , B: Order antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels , C: Order lower extremity duplex ultrasound , D: Order antibiotic therapy. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for a vasculitic process. The purpura and petechiae are consistent with a small vessel vasculitis, such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). HSP is a systemic vasculitis that most commonly affects children, but it can also occur in adults. The classic presentation of HSP is a purpuric rash on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, and joint pain. Other possible manifestations include renal involvement, gastrointestinal bleeding, and central nervous system involvement.

The laboratory findings are also consistent with a vasculitic process. The elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level suggest inflammation. The elevated platelet count may be secondary to the vasculitis or to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The normal creatinine level and urinalysis results suggest that the patient's renal function is not impaired.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and complement levels. ANA is a test that detects antibodies to nuclear antigens. ANCA is a test that detects antibodies to cytoplasmic antigens of neutrophils and monocytes. Complement levels are a measure of the activity of the complement system, which is a part of the body's immune system.

The results of these tests can help to determine the specific type of vasculitis that the patient has. For example, a positive ANA test is often seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including vasculitis. A positive ANCA test is often seen in Wegener granulomatosis, a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs.

The results of these tests can also help to guide treatment. For example, patients with SLE are often treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. Patients with Wegener granulomatosis are often treated with cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug.

Title: An 18-Month History of Dorsal Foot Lesions Case is: A 32-year-old Nigerian woman presented with dull pain, pruritus, and discoloration of the dorsal aspect of both feet for 18 months. Her medical history included a red blood cell transfusion as a child and 2 uncomplicated pregnancies.The lesions started as small papules on the dorsal right great toe and left third toe that gradually spread across the dorsum of her feet over the following 12 months. An over-the-counter antifungal ointment was unhelpful. Her primary care physician completed a biopsy, diagnosed verruca plantaris, and prescribed topical salicylic acid twice daily for 4 weeks. The lesions did not improve, and her foot pain worsened. Subsequent treatment with topical liquid nitrogen cryotherapy was ineffective.Three months after cryotherapy, the patient presented to the dermatology clinic regarding the lesions on her feet. The patient stated that the lesions had been stable in size for the previous 6 months, without bleeding, discharge, or change in color. She continued to have 6 of 10, dull, constant pain that was nonradiating, improved when she soaked her feet in water, and worsened with any type of topical pressure or wrapping. Physical examination revealed multiple well-circumscribed, scaly plaques with cobblestone surfaces on the dorsal aspects of the forefoot and midfoot bilaterally. Findings were more severe on the right and left hindfoot (Figure, left panel). On serologic testing, the patient was negative for HIV and positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV). A punch biopsy of the right foot lesion revealed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, eosinophils, papillary dermal inflammation, and intraepidermal necrosis (Figure, right panel).Left, Dorsal aspects of bilateral forefoot and midfoot of a 32-year-old Nigerian woman.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of a red blood cell transfusion as a child, which puts her at risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The lesions on her feet are consistent with HCV-associated lichen planus, a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes. Lichen planus is typically characterized by flat-topped, purplish papules that can be itchy or painful. The lesions on this patient's feet are also scaly, which is a less common finding in lichen planus. However, scaling can occur in patients with HCV-associated lichen planus who have been treated with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is not necessary in this case. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with HCV-associated lichen planus, and there is no evidence of other medical conditions that would require further evaluation.

A punch biopsy of the right foot lesion is the most appropriate next step. This will allow for definitive diagnosis of lichen planus and assessment of the severity of the inflammation. The biopsy can also be used to rule out other possible causes of the patient's lesions, such as psoriasis or eczema.

Title: APOE  ɛ 4  Allele Testing and Risk of Alzheimer Disease Case is: A 64-year-old man presented with concern about an abnormal genetic test result for apolipoprotein E (APOE) obtained through his primary care physician. He reported forgetfulness and word-finding difficulties for 3 years but performed all activities of daily living independently and was generally healthy. His father and maternal great aunt developed dementia in their 70s. Physical (including neurologic) examination, basic laboratory studies, and brain magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The Short Test of Mental Status (STMS) score was 33 (maximal attainable score of 38 indicates best performance). Neuropsychological assessment showed average to above-average performance in all cognitive domains, accounting for age and education. Results of his genetic testing for APOE were reported as follows: “This individual possesses an apolipoprotein E genotype (3 and 4) that indicates, with high specificity, that Alzheimer’s disease is the cause of or a contributor to the observed dementia.”Obtain a brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan.Order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers.Reassure and address patient’s concerns and follow up in 1 year.What Would You Do Next? A: Obtain a brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan. , B: Order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers. , C: Reassure and address patient’s concerns and follow up in 1 year. , D: Refer for genetic counseling.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has an APOE ɛ4 allele, which is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, he is currently asymptomatic and has no evidence of dementia on physical examination, laboratory studies, or brain MRI. Neuropsychological assessment showed average to above-average performance in all cognitive domains.

An FDG-PET scan can be used to detect the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, FDG-PET scans are not always accurate in early-stage Alzheimer's disease, and they can also be abnormal in other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease.

CSF testing can be used to measure levels of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, such as tau and beta-amyloid. However, CSF testing is not always accurate in early-stage Alzheimer's disease, and it can also be abnormal in other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis.

In this case, it is most appropriate to reassure the patient and address his concerns. The patient is currently asymptomatic and has no evidence of dementia. He should be told that he has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but that there are things he can do to reduce his risk, such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and staying mentally and socially active. He should also be told that there are early detection and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, so that he can seek treatment if he starts to experience symptoms.

Title: Bilateral Ptosis and Ophthalmoplegia in a Young Man Case is: An 18-year-old man with unremarkable medical history was referred to the oculoplastics service for evaluation of progressive gradual-onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia in both eyes in the past 2 years (Figure). He had emigrated from Ghana 2 years before but denied any illness there. His visual acuity without correction was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, although he had to manually elevate his eyelids to see the Snellen chart. He had no movement of the right eye past midline in elevation, adduction, depression, and abduction and no movement of the left eye past midline in elevation, depression, and abduction, with 50% deficit of adduction. His external examination results were notable for a margin reflex distance 1 of −4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU. On funduscopic examination, his optic nerves were sharp and pink without atrophy, maculae and retinal vasculature were normal, and peripheral retina appeared normal without pigment abnormalities. A review of systems was negative for fatigue, generalized muscle weakness, or neurologic deficits.Clinical photograph of the patient, who presented with severe bilateral ptosis.Perform surgical repair of ptosis with frontalis slingOrder neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrastWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:** The patient presented with bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Ptosis is a drooping of the upper eyelid, while ophthalmoplegia is paralysis of the eye muscles. These findings are concerning for a third nerve palsy, which is a neurological condition that affects the third cranial nerve. The third cranial nerve controls the muscles that move the eye, so a third nerve palsy can cause ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and diplopia (double vision).

To further evaluate the patient, I would order neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast. MRI can help to visualize the brain and orbits, and it can be used to identify any abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme level and serum tumor marker findings were normal. Infection panel screenings for hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, and parasites were negative. Antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic (PET/CT) imaging detected no hypermetabolic changes. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profiling, including cytologic analysis, was normal. Culture of the CSF and blood was negative for bacteria and fungus.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes a variety of conditions, including:

* Multiple sclerosis (MS)
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
* Syphilis
* Lyme disease
* Vasculitis
* Lymphoma
* Metastatic cancer

To narrow the differential diagnosis, the next step in management should be to perform a brain or kidney biopsy. This would allow for direct visualization of the lesions and tissue diagnosis. Genetic sequencing could also be helpful in identifying a specific genetic mutation that may be associated with the patient's condition. However, genetic sequencing is not always necessary and can be expensive. A second CSF culture is not likely to be helpful, as the first culture was negative. Aqueous humor paracentesis is not typically performed in patients with this presentation.

Title: A Man With a Cloudy Cornea Case is: A 77-year-old man was referred to the cornea service for painless, progressive blurring of vision in his left eye. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OS, and the patient reported that his vision had waxed and waned over several months. His ocular history included cataract surgery in the left eye, followed by yttrium-aluminum-garnet capsulotomy 2 months before his referral. Of note, he had recently undergone Mohs surgery and subsequent reconstruction for squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the lateral canthus in the fellow eye; he also had a medical history of multiple skin malignant neoplasms.Slitlamp examination findings were notable for a grayish cornea opacity that appeared to be lusterless, abutting the nasal limbus and extending into the visual axis (Figure 1A). There was no apparent conjunctival erythema or appreciable feeder vessels at the limbus. The rest of the examination findings, including the fundus, were unremarkable. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) indicated that the hyperreflective corneal lesion did not involve the cornea stroma (Figure 1B).Examination findings at presentation.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of multiple skin malignant neoplasms, and the lesion on his cornea is suspicious for a malignancy. Superficial keratectomy is a safe and effective procedure to obtain a biopsy specimen for histopathologic examination. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Answer: A

The other answer choices are not appropriate in this case. Calcium chelation with EDTA therapy is not indicated for the treatment of corneal neoplasms. Penetrating keratoplasty is a major surgical procedure that is not indicated for a small, superficial lesion. Observation with follow-up for changes over the next 6 to 12 months is not an appropriate management option for a patient with a suspicious corneal lesion.

Title: Scalp Eruption in a Patient With Metastatic Colon Cancer Case is: A 73-year-old man with metastatic BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer presented with a 1-month history of crusted lesions with purulent drainage on the scalp, with associated pruritus and pain. Five months earlier he began treatment with cetuximab, binimetinib, and encorafenib, complicated by a grade 1 acneiform eruption that was managed with doxycycline hyclate and topical hydrocortisone and clindamycin phosphate. Oncologic therapy was withheld pending further evaluation of the scalp eruption. He had a distant history of actinic keratoses on the scalp treated with liquid nitrogen but otherwise denied previous skin cancer. Examination of the scalp revealed male pattern baldness, diffuse actinic damage, and multiple thick, yellow-brown crusts overlying erosions with purulent drainage (Figure 1). A wound culture was performed and grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. A shave biopsy was obtained.What Is Your Diagnosis?

A wound culture was performed and grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. A shave biopsy was obtained.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes folliculitis decalvans, squamous cell carcinoma, erosive pustular dermatosis, and pemphigus foliaceus. Folliculitis decalvans is a chronic, scarring alopecia characterized by follicular pustules and crusts. It is often associated with diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and other immunosuppressive conditions. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can arise from the epidermis. It is the most common type of skin cancer, and it is often associated with sun exposure. Erosive pustular dermatosis is a rare, inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by erosions and pustules on the scalp. It is often associated with autoimmune diseases, such as pemphigus foliaceus. Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disease that is characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions on the scalp, face, and trunk.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is folliculitis decalvans. This is because he has a history of diabetes mellitus, which is a risk factor for folliculitis decalvans. Additionally, his scalp lesions are consistent with folliculitis decalvans, as they are characterized by follicular pustules and crusts. The diagnosis of folliculitis decalvans can be confirmed with a shave biopsy.

Title: Olfactory Disorder With No Menarche in a Teenager Case is: A 16-year-old female complained of an olfactory disorder since birth. She had a history of a laryngeal tracheoesophageal fissure, intestinal hernia, and hearing loss because of an ossicular malformation. From age 10 years, she was unable to catch up with conversation of curry smell. Olfactory tests were performed, and T&T olfactometry1 results showed severe hyposmia (5.4/5.4; detection threshold/odor recognition threshold). On the card-type odor identification test, Open Essence,2 she only identified menthol correctly. Her Self-Administered Odor Questionnaire3 score was 20%. Her visual analog scale4 score was 10 for odor but 100 for taste. There were no unusual nasal findings on endoscopy or computed tomography. Because we suspected a congenital olfactory disorder, we recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which showed olfactory bulb (OB) atrophy (Figure, A).A, Coronal short-tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the olfactory bulb shows that the olfactory fissure remains aerated, but the olfactory bulb is slightly atrophied on both sides (arrowheads). There were no dysplastic signs in the frontal gyri. B and C, An axial MRI T2-weighted image of the pelvis shows vaginal defects and bilateral 1 layer–differentiated uterine rudiments (arrowheads) that were 35 mm on the left and 37 mm on the right. Both ovaries are normal (equivalent to Mullerian duct anomaly class I).The patient also confirmed that she had not started menstruating. After consulting the pediatric department, an endocrine test was performed. The results showed an atypical reaction to the insulin tolerance test. However, the results for adrenocorticotropic hormone/cortisol corticotropin-releasing hormone load test, diurnal variation, and urine accumulation were normal. The luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values were normal as determined by LH-releasing hormone load tests. She was subsequently referred to the gynecology department.

The most likely diagnosis is Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. MRKH syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and vagina. It is caused by a mutation in a gene that is involved in the development of the reproductive organs. The syndrome is usually diagnosed in adolescence, when a girl does not start menstruating. The diagnosis is confirmed by imaging studies, such as an MRI scan.

There is no cure for MRKH syndrome, but treatment can help to improve the quality of life for affected women. Treatment options include hormone therapy to help with puberty and menstruation, and surgery to create a vagina. Women with MRKH syndrome can still have a normal sex life and pregnancy, with the help of assisted reproductive technologies.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 70s with recurrent primary peritoneal carcinoma receiving pembrolizumab and ipilimumab who presents with a pruritic rash that had been ongoing for 2 weeks. The rash started as an erythematous papule on her right arm 2 months after initiation of a new immunotherapy regimen, then gradually enlarged and spread to involve both legs. She denied any new systemic symptoms associated with onset of the rash. A recent trial of oral terbinafine for possible tinea corporis yielded no improvement.

For management of her rash, the patient was prescribed betamethasone dipropionate, 0.05%, ointment (augmented).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes erythema annulare centrifugum, eosinophilic annular erythema, granuloma annulare, and drug-induced bullous pemphigoid.

**Erythema annulare centrifugum** is a common skin condition that typically presents as annular plaques with central clearing. The lesions are often pruritic and can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the extremities. The cause of erythema annulare centrifugum is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. Treatment is generally with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

**Eosinophilic annular erythema** is a rare skin condition that typically presents as annular plaques with central clearing and a peripheral ring of erythema. The lesions are often pruritic and can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk and extremities. The cause of eosinophilic annular erythema is unknown, but it is thought to be an allergic reaction. Treatment is generally with topical steroids or oral antihistamines.

**Granuloma annulare** is a common skin condition that typically presents as small, raised, red or skin-colored bumps. The bumps are often grouped together in annular or arc-shaped lesions. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. Treatment is generally not necessary, but the lesions may be treated with topical steroids or oral steroids.

**Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid** is a rare skin condition that is caused by an allergic reaction to a medication. The condition typically presents as blisters and erosions on the skin. The blisters are often filled with fluid and can be very painful. The cause of drug-induced bullous pemphigoid is the body's immune system mistakenly attacking the skin cells. Treatment is generally with oral steroids.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of erythema annulare centrifugum. The patient's rash started as an erythematous papule on her right arm 2 months after initiation of a new immunotherapy regimen, then gradually enlarged and spread to involve both legs. She denied any new systemic symptoms associated with onset of the rash. A recent trial of oral terbinafine for possible tinea corporis yielded no improvement. Physical examination revealed erythematous annular plaques without scale on her right arm and bilateral legs. A 4-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the patient’s right arm, and the histopathologic findings were consistent with erythema annulare centrifugum. The patient's rash was treated with topical steroids and resolved.

Title: Leonine Facies and Madarosis in a Man With Shortness of Breath Case is: A man in his 60s presented as a transfer from an outside hospital. The division of dermatology was consulted for evaluation of lesions on the face, chest, back, and arms that were gradually increasing in size and number over the past year. Physical examination revealed leonine facies with madarosis and an eschar on the nasal dorsum (Figure, A). Red-to-brown dome-shaped papules coalescing into plaques were present on the upper extremities. The lesions were nontender and nonpruritic. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. The patient had a muffled voice and reported shortness of breath with exertion. Results of laboratory investigation demonstrated marked leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 77.5 × 103/uL with 76.5% lymphocytes. No blasts were present on peripheral smear. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated multiple enlarged mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal lymph nodes. Small pulmonary nodules were also detected. A punch biopsy was obtained from the right arm (Figure, B, C, and D).A, Infiltrative plaques and nodules obscuring normal facial architecture.

Small pulmonary nodules were also detected. A punch biopsy was obtained from the right arm, which shows normal epidermis with dense diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate composed of small to medium cells with irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemistry shows diffusely positive cyclin D1 staining.

The most likely diagnosis is mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma that typically presents in older adults with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. The skin is involved in up to 20% of cases. The characteristic skin lesions are violaceous papules or plaques that often have a follicular accentuation. The diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma is made on the basis of a lymph node biopsy, which shows a proliferation of small to medium-sized B cells with irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemistry shows diffuse expression of CD5 and cyclin D1.

Other possible diagnoses include follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma that typically presents in older adults with lymphadenopathy. The skin is involved in up to 10% of cases. The characteristic skin lesions are erythematous papules or plaques. The diagnosis of follicular lymphoma is made on the basis of a lymph node biopsy, which shows a proliferation of small to medium-sized B cells with irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemistry shows follicular and marginal zone patterns of light chain expression. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma that typically presents in older adults with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. The skin is involved in up to 10% of cases. The characteristic skin lesions are violaceous papules or plaques. The diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is made on the basis of a lymph node biopsy, which shows a proliferation of large B cells with irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemistry shows diffuse expression of CD20 and CD38. Marginal zone lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma that typically presents in older adults with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. The skin is involved in up to 10% of cases. The characteristic skin lesions are erythematous papules or plaques. The diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma is made on the basis of a lymph node biopsy, which shows a proliferation of small to medium-sized B cells with irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemistry shows marginal zone pattern of light chain expression.

Title: A Patient Presenting With a Viral Prodrome, Palpitations, Dizziness, and Heart Block Case is: A previously healthy young adult presented with 1 week of fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, preceded by fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough. Emergency department evaluation noted a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 173/90 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.1 °C. An electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute (Figure, A). Investigation revealed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 30 mm/h (normal limits, 0-15 mm/h) and a C-reactive protein level of 6.3 mg/dL (reference range, 0.0-1.0 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10.0]). Tests for kidney function, hepatic function, a complete blood cell count, troponin T levels, creatine kinase levels, thyrotropin levels, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor had normal results, and tests for anti–streptolysin O and anti–DNAse B titers, Lyme IgG and IgM titers, Coxiella burnetti and Bartonella serologies, Epstein-Barr virus serology, and cytomegalovirus quantification had negative results. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, while fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum (Figure, B). Systemic FDG uptake was absent. A CT showed no hilar adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Over the next 48 hours, the patient’s junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minutes associated with lightheadedness (Figure, C).A, A rhythm strip at presentation with a sinus rhythm with complete heart block. B, A fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography image with a focal area of fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the region of the atrioventricular node and His bundle.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are consistent with an acute inflammatory myocarditis. The FDG-PET–CT findings suggest a focal myocarditis involving the membranous septum. The patient's junctional rhythm accelerated to 90 beats per minute with ventriculoatrial block before acutely degenerating to a narrow complex escape rhythm of 45 beats per minute associated with lightheadedness. These findings are consistent with a hemodynamically significant atrioventricular block.

Answer: B. Place a temporary pacemaker and start corticosteroids.

The patient should be treated with a temporary pacemaker to stabilize her heart rhythm and prevent further hemodynamic compromise. Corticosteroids should be started to reduce inflammation and prevent further progression of the myocarditis. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, a permanent pacemaker can be implanted.

Title: A Middle-aged Woman With Severe Scoliosis and Encephalopathy Case is: A 42-year-old woman presented with clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy (Figure, A and B). She was born in 1973 at 38th week of gestation followed by a normal delivery (weight, 3.15 kg and head circumference, 42 cm) to nonconsanguineous parents. The head size was normal at birth, and no other abnormalities were seen during her infancy. At age 2 years, her parents noticed that she had delayed motor and language milestones. She experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. The severity of scoliosis increased with age, and she became a wheelchair user at age 18 years. She was referred to us at age 40 years with the characteristic features of growth deceleration (height, 142 cm; weight, 22 kg; body mass index, 11 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]), apraxia, left-sided hemiplegia, spasticity, sleep apnea, constipation, osteoporosis, hypoalgesia, and repetitive hand tapping (Video). Blood reports showed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). There was no history of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion (V3-V6), and echocardiography showed mild cardiomegaly. The brain magnetic resonance imaging studies showed a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry (Figure, C).A, Characteristic features of a 42-year-old woman with microcephaly.

Title: Scaly Dermatitis and Edema in an Irritable Child Case is: A 19-month-old boy presented for evaluation of widespread edema and acute dermatitis. Following an upper respiratory tract infection 1 month prior, he developed disseminated red, scaly patches and a progressive eruption of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches of skin. He had occasional nonbloody loose stools but no fevers or vomiting. Although he was otherwise well, his growth had fallen from the 75th to the 25th percentile for height and weight over the preceding 9 months, and he could speak only 2 words. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis and diarrhea in infancy that prompted allergy testing at age 6 months; he was subsequently diagnosed with milk, egg, and peanut allergies. His parents avoided feeding him these foods, providing him only soy-based milk and formula, with improvement of dermatitis, until age 1 year. Since then his diet had consisted of multiple rice milk feeds daily, supplemented only with pureed fruits and vegetables, pasta, snack puffs, and sunflower butter. The patient had no history of meconium ileus or family history of cystic fibrosis. There was no recent travel and no changes to the home environment.On presentation, the patient was irritable, with normal vital signs. He displayed prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination was notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities (Figure; left panel). Notably, his skin also demonstrated widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth (Figure; right panel).Physical examination findings at presentation.

Reasoning: The patient presents with a history of atopic dermatitis, diarrhea, and milk, egg, and peanut allergies. He has had a decline in growth and development over the past 9 months, and he can only speak two words. On physical examination, he has prominent scrotal swelling and pitting edema of the legs bilaterally. Skin examination is notable for erythematous, denuded patches with peeling scale and reticulate hyperpigmentation, accentuated on the abdomen, back, diaper area, and extensor extremities. Notably, his skin also demonstrates widespread patches of hypopigmentation, with an accompanying band of hypopigmentation proximally at the site of newest hair growth.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes atopic dermatitis, protein-losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin condition that is characterized by dry, itchy skin. It is often associated with other allergic conditions, such as asthma and food allergies. Protein-losing enteropathy is a condition in which the small intestine loses excessive amounts of protein into the stool. This can lead to malnutrition, as well as edema and other signs of hypoproteinemia. Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disease that is characterized by the loss of protein in the urine. This can lead to edema, as well as other signs of hypoproteinemia. Malnutrition is a condition in which the body does not have enough nutrients to meet its needs. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including growth retardation, poor wound healing, and infection.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to check levels of serum protein, albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional laboratory measures. This will help to assess the patient's nutritional status and to determine if he is at risk for protein-losing enteropathy or nephrotic syndrome. Urinalysis and urine microscopy should also be performed to evaluate for protein in the urine. If protein is found in the urine, this would be supportive of a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. A skin biopsy may also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 40-year-old previously healthy woman who presented to the emergency department with 24 hours of dizziness, imbalance, bilateral lower extremity weakness, blurred vision, chest pain, and a painful rash on the left foot with tenderness of the fingers and toes. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 36.7 °C (98.1 °F); blood pressure, 121/82 mm Hg; pulse, 74/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. Physical examination revealed petechiae within a poorly demarcated erythematous patch on the left dorsal foot (Figure 1, left panel), splinter hemorrhages on the right thumbnail (Figure 1, center panel), and petechial macules on the palms and soles, most numerous on the distal digits. There was no murmur or plop on cardiac auscultation. Neurologic examination findings were significant for left eye nystagmus and inability to adduct the right eye on left gaze, consistent with right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum. Results of laboratory testing were notable for mild leukocytosis (12.2 × 109/L), mild thrombocytosis (439 × 109/L), and elevated troponin level (4.4 ng/mL); results of a comprehensive metabolic panel and the remainder of the complete blood cell count were normal. An electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography (Figure 1, right panel) were performed.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a systemic vasculitis, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. The skin rash, petechiae, and splinter hemorrhages are consistent with a vasculitic process. The neurologic findings, including the right-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia, are also consistent with a vasculitic process involving the central nervous system. The elevated troponin level suggests that the patient may have had a recent myocardial infarction. The CT scan of the head showed 2 acute infarcts in the right cerebellum, which is also consistent with a vasculitic process. The laboratory findings, including the mild leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated troponin level, are nonspecific but are supportive of a systemic inflammatory process. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversions in lead V2, which is consistent with a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac CT angiography showed no evidence of structural heart disease.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a systemic vasculitis, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. The next step in management is to perform a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a vasculitis. If the skin biopsy is positive for a vasculitis, then the patient will need to be started on treatment with immunosuppressive medications. The treatment of systemic vasculitis is beyond the scope of this question.

Title: Recurrent Subconjunctival Hemorrhage in a Child With an Orbital Mass Case is: A well-appearing 14-month-old girl was referred for the evaluation of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. Multiple prior office visits with referring ophthalmologists during which eyes were dilated showed normal results. Clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid (Figure 1A). Fixation was central, steady, and maintained bilaterally, with full ocular motility and absence of appreciable proptosis. Penlight anterior segment examination demonstrated normally formed anterior segment structures without inflammation or hyphema in either eye, although the left eye exhibited a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Examination under anesthesia (EUA) was deemed appropriate and further demonstrated normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. Handheld slitlamp examination localized the left eye 2-mm limbal lesion on the posterior corneal surface. The surrounding corneal and iris structures were normal appearing without evidence of vascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used to further evaluate both the intraocular lesion and better characterize the left lower eyelid fullness. This demonstrated no iris, angle, or ciliary body involvement by the intraocular lesion. A 10-MHz contact B-scan examination showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension (Figure 1B). Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause.Clinical photograph of a subconjunctival hemorrhage of the left eye (A) and B-scan image of an orbital mass (B).Refer the child for a biopsy of the lesionWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 14-month-old girl with a history of recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age. The clinical examination revealed 180° of left interior subconjunctival hemorrhage with overlying conjunctival elevation and mild fullness of the left lower eyelid. The intraocular pressure was normal bilaterally. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension. Doppler ultrasonography did not demonstrate significant flow to suggest a vascular cause.

The differential diagnosis of a large orbital mass in a child includes hemangioma, lymphangioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and optic nerve glioma. Hemangiomas are the most common orbital tumor in children, followed by lymphangiomas. Rhabdomyosarcomas are the most common malignant orbital tumor in children. Optic nerve gliomas are rare, but they are the most common primary brain tumor in children.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the orbital mass. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. A biopsy can be performed under local anesthesia in the office or under general anesthesia in the operating room.

Title: Progressive Eyelid Swelling in a Middle-aged Man Case is: An African American man in his 40s was referred for evaluation of a 3-week history of pain and swelling over his right orbit and upper eyelid. Worsening edema prompted his primary care physician to initiate a course of oral methylprednisolone and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which did not alleviate the symptoms. Because of persistent swelling, he was referred for further evaluation. The patient denied fevers, chills, purulent drainage, otalgia, or odynophagia. The patient had no history of frequent sinusitis, trauma, or exposure to chemicals, but he did note poor dentition.On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils were reactive, extraocular motility was full, and intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Exophthalmometer readings were 21 mm OD and 18 mm OS with a base of 120 mm. Inspection of the right upper eyelid was remarkable for a 2.2-cm fluctuant mass with surrounding erythema that was tender to palpation. Computed tomography (CT) of the face and head demonstrated a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect resulting in right hypoglobus, multiple communicating channels through inner and outer tables with cortical breakthrough in the frontal sinus, and advanced dental caries that communicated directly with the maxillary sinus owing to cortex erosion (Figure).Coronal sections of a computed tomographic image of the orbits with intravenous contrast. There is a 2.2-cm right supraorbital abscess with mass effect on the right globe leading to a hypoglobus (arrowhead). The abscess has a direct communication with the right frontal sinus. One of the channels that directly communicates with the right supraorbital abscess shows adjacent cortical breakthrough. Of note, there are also extensive dental caries with direct erosion of the maxillary roots into the maxillary sinus.Refer to an ear, nose, and throat physician for removal of frontal sinus cystic liningPerform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgeryWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**

The patient has a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect resulting in right hypoglobus, multiple communicating channels through inner and outer tables with cortical breakthrough in the frontal sinus, and advanced dental caries that communicated directly with the maxillary sinus owing to cortex erosion. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of frontal sinusitis and odontogenic infection.

The initial treatment of frontal sinusitis is with antibiotics. However, in this case, the patient has failed to respond to oral antibiotics. In addition, the CT scan shows that the abscess has a direct communication with the frontal sinus. This suggests that the infection is not limited to the orbit, but is also involving the frontal sinus.

Therefore, the next step in management is to refer the patient to an ear, nose, and throat physician for removal of the frontal sinus cystic lining. This will allow for drainage of the abscess and debridement of the infected tissue. In addition, the patient may need to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery to address the underlying sinusitis.

Title: Persistent Red Eye Unresponsive to Topical Treatment Case is: A 68-year-old woman presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of progressive left eye redness and discomfort unresponsive to topical antibiotics or lubricants, as prescribed by her optometrist. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was raised (26 mm Hg) and was treated with a topical β-blocker. Otherwise, her condition was managed conservatively for presumed viral conjunctivitis.She self-presented 6 days later with intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis. The IOP remained raised (24 mm Hg). An inflammatory or allergic etiology was suspected; therefore, topical corticosteroids and a prostaglandin analogue were also prescribed.One week later at planned follow-up, the patient had dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels (Figure 1). Further interrogation of the history revealed a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear.Suggest supportive strategies (eg, cold compresses, ocular lubricants) and consider increasing the topical corticosteroid treatment or prescribing a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)Prescribe an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression (oral corticosteroid) and perform chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and other studiesPerform a general examination (for a port-wine stain) and dilated ophthalmoscopyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is C: Refer the patient for urgent neuroimaging.

The patient has a 3-week history of progressive left eye redness and discomfort that is unresponsive to topical antibiotics, lubricants, corticosteroids, and a prostaglandin analogue. She also has a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in her left ear. These findings are concerning for a serious underlying condition, such as an intracranial mass lesion or vasculitis. Urgent neuroimaging is necessary to rule out these conditions and to determine the appropriate treatment.

Supportive strategies, such as cold compresses and ocular lubricants, may be helpful in relieving the patient's symptoms. However, these measures will not address the underlying cause of her condition. Increasing the topical corticosteroid treatment or prescribing a topical NSAID may also be helpful in relieving the patient's symptoms, but these medications can also have serious side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma. Systemic immunosuppression with oral corticosteroids or an oral NSAID is also not without risks, and it is not clear that this would be beneficial in this patient.

A general examination, including a search for a port-wine stain, may be helpful in diagnosing certain conditions, such as Sturge-Weber syndrome. However, this finding is not present in this patient. Dilated ophthalmoscopy may reveal signs of an underlying retinal or choroidal vasculopathy, but this finding is also not present in this patient.

Urgent neuroimaging is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. This will allow for the diagnosis of an underlying condition and the initiation of appropriate treatment.

Title: A Child With Acute Eyelid Edema and Proptosis Case is: A 2-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with 2 days of left upper eyelid swelling that started 1 day after an episode of vomiting due to a viral illness. She had no associated fever, chills, upper respiratory tract symptoms, lethargy, or changes in behavior. She had an unremarkable ocular and medical history. On examination, visual acuity was fix-and-follow in each eye. Both eyes were soft to palpation. Pupils were round, symmetric, and reactive to light without an afferent pupillary defect. Ocular movements were full, and the patient had grossly full visual fields to confrontation. External examination revealed mild left-sided ptosis, axial proptosis, and upper eyelid fullness with no mass or tenderness to palpation (Figure, A). Slitlamp and fundus examination results were unremarkable, and there was no left optic nerve edema or pallor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a left intraconal mass that was isointense relative to rectus muscles on T1-weighted images and hypointense with a hyperintense rim on T2-weighted images (Figure, B).A, Clinical photograph showing left upper eyelid fullness (arrowhead) and mild axial proptosis.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 2-year-old girl with a 2-day history of left upper eyelid swelling that started 1 day after an episode of vomiting due to a viral illness. She has no associated fever, chills, upper respiratory tract symptoms, lethargy, or changes in behavior. She has an unremarkable ocular and medical history.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits revealed a left intraconal mass that was isointense relative to rectus muscles on T1-weighted images and hypointense with a hyperintense rim on T2-weighted images.

The differential diagnosis for a child with acute eyelid edema and proptosis includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including:

* Orbital cellulitis
* Dacryocystitis
* Rhabdomyosarcoma
* Lymphoma
* Langerhans cell histiocytosis
* Leukemia
* Neuroblastoma
* Ewing sarcoma
* Retinoblastoma

The most likely diagnosis in this case is rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, and it can occur in any part of the body, including the orbit. The most common presenting symptom of rhabdomyosarcoma is proptosis, which is often accompanied by eyelid edema, pain, and redness.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the orbital mass to confirm the diagnosis and determine the subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma. The treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma depends on the subtype of tumor, the stage of disease, and the age of the patient. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Title: An Unusual Retropharyngeal Lesion Case is: A female smoker in her 50s was referred for hyperparathyroidism and a multinodular goiter. The patient reported symptoms of joint and musculoskeletal pain and fatigue but denied fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, and kidney stones. Her medical history was remarkable for congestive heart failure and schizophrenia. Neck examination revealed no meaningful findings except right thyroid enlargement. Results of laboratory evaluation demonstrated normal white blood cell count, borderline hypercalcemia (10.6 mg/dL), and elevated parathyroid hormone level (208 pg/mL). She underwent ultrasonography at an outside facility, and results demonstrated a 2.2-cm dominant right thyroid nodule with additional smaller thyroid nodules. Findings of preoperative technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi planar and single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) imaging (Figure, A) were nonlocalizing for a parathyroid adenoma and showed increased uptake in the dominant right thyroid nodule (Figure, B). Results of an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid nodule demonstrated a benign colloid nodule with cystic changes. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast was obtained, and findings were initially reported as negative except for right multinodular goiter. However, on additional review, a well-circumscribed fat density mass measuring 3.0 × 2.3 × 1.1-cm was identified in the right retropharyngeal space posterior to the hypopharynx (Figure, C).A, Results of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) demonstrated relatively low radiopharmaceutical uptake superior to the expected area of the parathyroid glands.

The most likely diagnosis is ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma. Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma is a rare condition characterized by the presence of a parathyroid adenoma in a retropharyngeal location. It is typically seen in middle-aged women and is often associated with hyperparathyroidism. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results. Treatment is surgical excision.

Title: A Painful Right Maxillary Swelling Case is: A 19-year-old woman with no noteworthy medical issues or surgical history presented to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic with a 3-month history of right-sided maxillary pain and swelling. The patient denied any drainage from the site but reported worsening swelling and pain over the past several weeks. On physical examination, there was noted intraoral swelling involving the buccal and palatal aspects of the posterior maxilla. The lesion was soft and fluctuant with no appreciable drainage. The patient’s history was notable for an 8-year history of right maxillary first premolar impaction. Findings from computed tomography of the head demonstrated a relatively spherical 4-cm growth of the right anterior maxilla abutting the maxillary sinus and orbital floors, and enclosing an impacted premolar at the superior margin of the growth (Figure, A). There was no proptosis or visual field changes associated with the lesion. An incisional biopsy was performed via an intraoral approach, and results demonstrated a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements (Figure, B and C). Following diagnostic confirmation, the patient was taken to the operating room, and a midface (Weber-Ferguson) incision was used to access the maxillary lesion for complete removal.A, Sagittal computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck demonstrating an expansile, 5.0-cm mass enclosing an impacted first maxillary premolar (white arrowhead).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a 3-month history of right-sided maxillary pain and swelling. The lesion is soft and fluctuant with no appreciable drainage. The patient’s history is notable for an 8-year history of right maxillary first premolar impaction. Findings from computed tomography of the head demonstrated a relatively spherical 4-cm growth of the right anterior maxilla abutting the maxillary sinus and orbital floors, and enclosing an impacted premolar at the superior margin of the growth. There was no proptosis or visual field changes associated with the lesion. An incisional biopsy was performed via an intraoral approach, and results demonstrated a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements. Following diagnostic confirmation, the patient was taken to the operating room, and a midface (Weber-Ferguson) incision was used to access the maxillary lesion for complete removal.

The most likely diagnosis is an odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). OKCs are the most common type of odontogenic cyst, accounting for approximately 20% of all odontogenic cysts. They are typically found in the second and third decades of life, and are more common in women than men. OKCs are often associated with impacted teeth, as in this case. They are typically asymptomatic, but can present with pain, swelling, and drainage. On imaging, OKCs appear as well-defined, radiolucent lesions. Histologically, OKCs are characterized by a thick, fibrous capsule and a lining of odontogenic epithelium. The epithelial lining may show cystic changes, including keratinization and pseudoglandular formation.

The treatment of OKCs is surgical excision. The lesion should be completely excised with a margin of healthy tissue. In this case, the patient underwent a midface (Weber-Ferguson) incision to access the maxillary lesion. The lesion was then completely excised with a margin of healthy tissue. The patient was then placed on a course of antibiotics to prevent infection.

The prognosis for patients with OKCs is excellent. With complete excision, the recurrence rate is low. However, OKCs can recur if they are not completely excised. Patients should be followed closely after treatment to monitor for recurrence.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a middle-aged woman with rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands, accompanied by 2 months of multiple finger joint and right shoulder pain. Results of autoimmune serology, including antinuclear antibody, C3 and C4, rheumatoid factor, and Scl-70 antibody tests, were negative. Raynaud phenomenon was not seen.

Two weeks after treatment initiation, multiple tender nodules developed over the palms and interphalangeal joints, and flexion contractures continued. Incisional skin biopsy of the palmar nodules and computed tomography (CT) were performed. Results of the CT demonstrated bilateral ovarian tumors with highly suspect peritoneal metastases.

The most likely diagnosis is **fibroblastic rheumatism**. Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of painful, subcutaneous nodules. The nodules are typically located on the hands, feet, and face. Fibroblastic rheumatism can also cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. The exact cause of fibroblastic rheumatism is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In the case of fibroblastic rheumatism, the immune system attacks the fibroblasts, which are cells that produce collagen. Collagen is a protein that is found in connective tissue.

The diagnosis of fibroblastic rheumatism is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The patient's history typically includes a report of the sudden onset of painful, subcutaneous nodules. The physical examination typically reveals the presence of multiple, tender nodules on the hands, feet, and face. Laboratory tests may show an elevated level of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). ANA are antibodies that attack the body's own tissues.

There is no cure for fibroblastic rheumatism, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen. NSAIDs can help to relieve pain and inflammation. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce the size of the nodules.

The prognosis for patients with fibroblastic rheumatism is generally good. Most patients experience a gradual improvement in their symptoms over time. However, the disease can be unpredictable, and some patients may experience a relapse of their symptoms.

Title: Reddish-Brown Hematomalike Annular Plaque in a Healthy Patient’s Axilla Case is: An otherwise healthy man in his 50s was referred to the Department of Dermatology with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla (Figure 1). The patient described the spontaneous onset of the lesion and reported no previous history of trauma or any other systemic symptoms; he had previously applied a topical antifungal cream but observed no lesion improvement. Physical examination revealed a nonindurated and well-defined 10 × 8-cm reddish-brown annular plaque with peripheral ecchymosis. No local lymphadenopathy was observed. Two biopsy specimens were obtained from different areas of the lesion for immunohistochemical studies; vascular channel endothelial cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40 and negative for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1). Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C were negative.Clinical image of the left axilla showing an asymptomatic, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border.What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a healthy man in his 50s with a 5-year history of an asymptomatic, gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla. The lesion is nonindurated and well-defined, and there is no local lymphadenopathy. Biopsy specimens show that the vascular channel endothelial cells are positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40, and negative for HHV-8 (latent nuclear antigen) and WT1. Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C are negative.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of benign lymphangioendothelioma (B-LE). B-LE is a rare, benign vascular tumor that typically affects adults. It can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in the skin and lymph nodes. The most common presentation is a solitary, asymptomatic, slowly growing lesion. The lesions of B-LE are typically reddish-brown or violaceous, and they may be nodular or plaque-like. They may also have a peau d'orange appearance.

The diagnosis of B-LE is made on biopsy. The biopsy shows a proliferation of endothelial cells that form vascular channels. The endothelial cells are positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40, and negative for HHV-8 (latent nuclear antigen) and WT1.

B-LE is a benign tumor that does not require treatment. However, if the lesion is cosmetically unacceptable or if it is causing symptoms, it can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

Title: A Pregnant Woman With Shortness of Breath Case is: A 40-year-old woman presented with a history of mitral valve (MV) endocarditis leading to MV repair (without annuloplasty) 15 years ago. Four years ago while pregnant, she had recurrent endocarditis complicated by severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation, but she was successfully brought to term and had a cesarean delivery. Post partum, her symptoms resolved, but she had persistent marked mitral regurgitation related to a severely deformed posterior leaflet. She wished to have another child, and after extensive counseling she elected to undergo a complex redo MV repair (annuloplasty) 2 years ago. She developed perioperative atrial fibrillation but declined anticoagulation and has not had further arrhythmias. Serial transthoracic echocardiograms have demonstrated normal biventricular function and pulmonary pressures. Her postoperative MV gradient was 10 mm Hg (heart rate, 90 beats per minute [bpm]) and has been stably elevated since surgery.At presentation, the patient was 19 weeks pregnant at presentation. She had mild exertional dyspnea, a right ventricular (RV) heave, and elevated jugular venous pulsation. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal biventricular function, mild RV dilation, RV systolic pressure of 84 mm Hg, normal left atrial size, and mean MV gradient of 18 mm Hg at a heart rate of 97 bpm. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mean MV gradient of 21 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 bpm (Figure). She strongly desired this pregnancy and declined termination.A, Color wave doppler demonstrating a mean mitral valve gradient of 21 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 beats per minute.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of mitral valve endocarditis, mitral valve repair, and recurrent endocarditis during pregnancy. She is currently 19 weeks pregnant and presents with mild exertional dyspnea, a right ventricular heave, and elevated jugular venous pulsation. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrates normal biventricular function, mild RV dilation, RV systolic pressure of 84 mm Hg, normal left atrial size, and mean MV gradient of 18 mm Hg at a heart rate of 97 bpm. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mean MV gradient of 21 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 bpm.

The patient's symptoms and findings on physical examination are consistent with mitral regurgitation. The elevated RV systolic pressure and mild RV dilation suggest that the mitral regurgitation is causing right ventricular pressure overload. The normal biventricular function suggests that the mitral regurgitation is not severe enough to cause left ventricular decompensation.

The patient's history of mitral valve endocarditis and recurrent endocarditis during pregnancy raises the concern for infective endocarditis. However, the patient has no fever, chills, or other systemic signs of infection. The transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms do not show any evidence of vegetations or other signs of infective endocarditis.

The patient's desire to carry this pregnancy to term and her refusal of anticoagulation make surgical mitral valve replacement a less attractive option. Balloon mitral valvuloplasty and transcatheter mitral valve-in-ring procedures are less invasive procedures that could be performed during pregnancy. However, these procedures are not without risk, and they may not be successful in all cases.

In this case, I would recommend a trial of medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin. Metoprolol is a beta blocker that can help to reduce the heart rate and improve cardiac output. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that can help to prevent thromboembolic events. I would also recommend that the patient be closely monitored with serial echocardiograms to assess the severity of her mitral regurgitation and the response to treatment.

C. Trial medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin

Title: A Young Patient With Painless Neck Swelling Case is: A 7-year-old African American girl without significant medical history presented with progressive painless right-sided neck swelling for 2 months. Initially, she experienced fever and sore throat. Physical examination findings demonstrated minimally tender and nonmobile 4-cm right submandibular space swelling. Laboratory examination findings were significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 19.8 K/μL; neutrophil count, 18.2 K/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]), anemia (hemoglobin level, 9.6 g/dL [to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0]), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>130 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein level (3.1 mg/dL [to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10]). Ultrasonography revealed multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. She was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture.

Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrated extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, and differential diagnosis, the most likely diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare, non-malignant disorder of the immune system that affects the Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. LCH can occur at any age, but it is most common in children under the age of 10. The most common symptoms of LCH are fever, rash, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy. LCH can also affect the skin, liver, spleen, lungs, and central nervous system.

The diagnosis of LCH is made based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is a biopsy of involved tissue, which shows the characteristic features of LCH, including the presence of Langerhans cells.

There is no cure for LCH, but the treatment can help to control the disease and prevent complications. Treatment options for LCH include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. The prognosis for children with LCH is generally good, with most patients experiencing long-term remission.

Title: Progressive Dry Cough in a Patient With ROS1-Rearranged Lung Adenocarcinoma Undergoing Crizotinib Therapy Case is: A 69-year-old man with a smoking history and complaints of back pain and cough for 2 weeks was found to have a right lung mass on chest radiography results. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a right upper lobe lung mass with multiple lymphadenopathies (N3), and bone scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging results showed multiple metastatic foci. A biopsy was performed, and the pathologic report showed a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with ROS1 rearrangement identified by immunohistochemical staining (clone: D4D6; H-score: 280) and further confirmative fluorescence in situ hybridization. The patient received ceritinib, 450 mg/day, and his tumor and brain and bone metastatic lesions subsequently decreased in size. The ceritinib was then shifted to crizotinib, 500 mg/day, when the reimbursement of crizotinib as a first-line therapy was approved by Taiwan's National Health Insurance system.Three weeks after the first dose of crizotinib, the patient developed a dry cough without fever or purulent sputum. There was no significant finding on physical examination except mild crackles over the right lung field, although chest radiography results showed a new consolidation lesion over the right upper lobe. Meanwhile, the results of mycobacterial and bacteriologic surveys were unremarkable. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased from an initial 14.76 to 0.71 ng/mL (reference range, 0-5.00 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1]). A CT scan was arranged, and developing lung cancer with lymphangitic carcinomatosis was highly suspected by the radiologist (Figure, A). A bronchoscopy with bronchial brushing and biopsy was performed, and no pathogen was identified.A, The comparison of the chest computed tomographic (CT) scan of the new consolidation lesion (red arrowheads) mimicking recurrence (right panel) with the primary tumor (yellow arrowhead) in the initial CT scan (left panel).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of lung cancer with ROS1 rearrangement. He was initially treated with ceritinib, which resulted in a favorable response. However, he developed a dry cough 3 weeks after starting crizotinib therapy. A chest CT scan showed a new consolidation lesion, and the patient was diagnosed with recurrent lung cancer. However, the results of mycobacterial and bacteriologic surveys were unremarkable, and the tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased. These findings suggest that the patient's cough may be due to TKI-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), rather than recurrent cancer.

Answer:
C. Administer steroid treatment and discontinue crizotinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) permanently because TKI-induced interstitial lung disease is highly suspected.

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results are consistent with TKI-induced ILD. Treatment of TKI-induced ILD typically involves discontinuing the TKI and administering corticosteroids. In some cases, it may be necessary to treat with additional immunosuppressive agents.

Title: Newborn With Unilateral Exophthalmos and Rapidly Growing Parotid Mass Case is: A male newborn was noted to have right eye and right cheek masses at birth. His prenatal course was complicated by maternal drug use, hepatitis C, and lack of routine prenatal care. Intraocular pressure of the right eye was elevated to 31 mm Hg (normal pressure, <20 mm Hg). Parotid ultrasonography demonstrated a lobulated solid vascular mass measuring 2.1 cm. The infant was referred to the ophthalmology and otolaryngology service. At the age of 5 weeks, a swollen right eye with a foggy cornea and conjunctival vascular anomaly were noted. A soft, mobile, right parotid mass had doubled in size.Ocular B-scan ultrasonography revealed a large subretinal lesion with multiple intralesional, hyperechoic foci extending temporally from the optic disc to the periphery. Results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intraocular mass in the right eye, with faint contrast enhancement thought to represent intratumoral calcification or hemorrhage, and a well-circumscribed, 3.1-cm, right superficial parotid mass with faint enhancement (Figure 1). 18F-fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed hypermetabolic masses at the posterior aspect of the right globe, the lateral aspect of the orbit, and the right parotid gland. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis provided no evidence of distant metastasis.

A pathological specimen from the parotid gland featured small blue cells with a fine chromatin granular pattern and complete loss of integrase interactor 1 (INI-1).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the head and neck region in children. The tumor is characterized by the presence of rhabdomyoblasts, which are cells that resemble skeletal muscle cells. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor that can spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs, liver, and bone.

The treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The goal of treatment is to achieve a cure, or to control the disease for as long as possible. The prognosis for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis, the type of tumor, and the patient's age.

Title: Urinary Magnesium in the Evaluation of Hypomagnesemia Case is: A 63-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hypertension was referred for refractory hypomagnesemia. Her blood pressure was 148/68 mm Hg, heart rate 96/min, and weight 106.4 kg. Medications included liraglutide, metformin, apixaban, sotalol, metoprolol, levothyroxine, venlafaxine, lisinopril, ranitidine, and magnesium oxide (400 mg, 2 times/d). Her prior serum magnesium levels ranged from 1.4 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL and a recent hemoglobin A1c level was 10.8%. Following baseline blood testing (Table), the patient collected a 24-hour urine sample after discontinuing magnesium supplements for 24 hours.Evaluate for alcoholism as the cause of hypomagnesemia.Improve glycemic control due to urinary magnesium loss from polyuria.Start insulin to promote magnesium reabsorption at the proximal convoluted tubule.Stop ranitidine due to concern for reduced gastrointestinal magnesium absorption.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **D. Stop ranitidine due to concern for reduced gastrointestinal magnesium absorption.**

**Reasoning:**

The patient's serum magnesium levels have been low for several months, despite taking oral magnesium supplements. Her 24-hour urine magnesium excretion is also high, suggesting that she is losing magnesium through the kidneys. Ranitidine is a medication that can reduce the absorption of magnesium from the gut. Therefore, stopping ranitidine is the most likely intervention to improve the patient's magnesium levels.

Alcoholism is a possible cause of hypomagnesemia, but it is less likely in a patient with a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes. Improved glycemic control may help to reduce urinary magnesium loss, but it is not the most likely intervention to improve the patient's magnesium levels. Insulin does not promote magnesium reabsorption at the proximal convoluted tubule.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to stop ranitidine.

Title: Posterior Subglottic Mass in a Patient With a History of Rectal Adenocarcinoma and Lung Metastases Case is: The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of a rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), he had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. He subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, he was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin (Figure, A). He had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease.A, An axial computed tomographic image reveals a new posterior subglottic lesion (pink arrowhead) of unclear etiology.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of heroin use who presented with syncope. She denied prodromal symptoms and reported this was her first syncopal episode. She reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, she had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Her vital signs and the results of her physical examination were normal. Troponin levels, thyroid levels, and the results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel were all normal. The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation was reviewed (Figure).

The most likely cause of the patient's syncope is an arrhythmia. The polymorphic ventricular tachycardia she experienced shortly after arrival at the emergency department is a concerning finding, as it is a type of arrhythmia that can be life-threatening. The patient's history of heroin use is also a risk factor for arrhythmias.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias. This test will help to determine if the patient has an arrhythmia that is triggered by exercise. If the patient is found to have an arrhythmia, she may be a candidate for treatment with amiodarone infusion therapy or implantation of an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

Title: Neurological Impairments in a Patient Returning From Cuba Case is: A 69-year-old woman returning from a vacation in Cuba was brought to the emergency department directly from the airport. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she had no allergies. She had been well until 2 hours before the flight home, when at the Havana airport, she developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. In flight, she had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence. On arrival to the emergency department, she was stuporous and required intubation. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL (reference range, 12.0-15.2 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0]), a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL (reference range, 0.51-1.08 [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. Serum electrolyte levels; a white blood cell count; levels of glucose, creatine kinase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; coagulation studies; and liver function tests had normal results. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi (Figure 1). Within several hours, her level of consciousness improved spontaneously, and she was extubated. Her blood pressure was 99/61 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; temperature, 37.6 °C; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. The patient was alert but disoriented. The pupils were 2 mm and reactive. Involuntary facial muscle twitching was noted. Her muscle tone was normal, and she had mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, with flexor plantar responses.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient's presentation is consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning. She developed generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting 2 hours before the flight home, which are all common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. In flight, she had lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence, which are also consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning. On arrival to the emergency department, she was stuporous and required intubation, which suggests that she was in severe respiratory distress. Initial laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, a creatinine level of 1.31 mg/dL, and a pH of 7.22 with a normal anion gap. These laboratory findings are not specific for carbon monoxide poisoning, but they do not suggest any other underlying medical conditions that could explain the patient's presentation. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds). These findings are also consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning. A urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. This finding rules out other common causes of intoxication, such as drug overdose. Cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. This finding does not support a diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. These findings rule out other possible infectious causes of the patient's symptoms. Computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi. This finding is highly specific for carbon monoxide poisoning.

Title: A Woman With Bilateral Visual Field Defects Case is: A 52-year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented for evaluation of visual field defects. Her ocular history was notable for open-angle glaucoma in both eyes, diagnosed 3 months previously. Selective laser trabeculoplasty and application of 4 topical agents in both eyes reduced intraocular pressure to the high single digits, yet visual field deterioration had continued. The patient reported headaches and loss of vision in the right eye, which started several months earlier. She had no history of trauma, neurosurgical procedures, or lumbar puncture.Examination findings were notable for visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS with an approximate correction of −6.50 D. An afferent pupillary defect of 2+ was detected in the right eye, and color vision was diminished in both eyes (1/13 Ishihara plates OD, 5/13 OS). Findings on slitlamp examination were normal. Applanation tonometry revealed an intraocular pressure of 10 mm Hg in both eyes. Findings on dilated fundus examination were notable for small, tilted discs without pallor, hyperemia, or elevated margins; tilting of the nerves precluded estimation of cup-disc ratio. Automated 24-2 Humphrey visual field testing revealed diffuse depression in the right eye (mean deviation, −26.97 decibels [dB]) and a dense inferior nasal defect in the left eye (mean deviation, −8.05 dB) (Figure).Optic disc photographs of the right (A) and left (B) eyes show small, tilted optic nerves with peripapillary atrophy but no hemorrhage, edema, hyperemia, or pallor.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of open-angle glaucoma in both eyes, diagnosed 3 months previously. Selective laser trabeculoplasty and application of 4 topical agents in both eyes reduced intraocular pressure to the high single digits, yet visual field deterioration has continued. The patient reports headaches and loss of vision in the right eye, which started several months earlier. She had no history of trauma, neurosurgical procedures, or lumbar puncture.

Examination findings were notable for visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS with an approximate correction of −6.50 D. An afferent pupillary defect of 2+ was detected in the right eye, and color vision was diminished in both eyes (1/13 Ishihara plates OD, 5/13 OS). Findings on slitlamp examination were normal. Applanation tonometry revealed an intraocular pressure of 10 mm Hg in both eyes. Findings on dilated fundus examination were notable for small, tilted discs without pallor, hyperemia, or elevated margins; tilting of the nerves precluded estimation of cup-disc ratio. Automated 24-2 Humphrey visual field testing revealed diffuse depression in the right eye (mean deviation, −26.97 decibels [dB]) and a dense inferior nasal defect in the left eye (mean deviation, −8.05 dB) (Figure).

The patient's findings are consistent with longstanding glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The diffuse depression in the right eye and the dense inferior nasal defect in the left eye are both characteristic of glaucomatous visual field loss. The small, tilted optic nerves with peripapillary atrophy are also consistent with glaucoma.

The patient's headaches are likely secondary to the glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The loss of vision in the right eye is also likely due to the glaucoma.

The patient's intraocular pressure is well-controlled with medical therapy. However, the visual field loss has continued despite this. This suggests that the patient may have a progressive form of glaucoma.

The patient should be monitored closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing. If the visual field loss continues to progress, the patient may need to undergo surgery to reduce intraocular pressure.

Title: A Solitary Lump on the Scalp Case is: A woman in her early 70s was referred to the dermatology department for evaluation of a solitary, asymptomatic lump on her scalp. She was born with the lesion but noticed some growth following a minor local trauma a couple of months prior to seeking medical evaluation. The patient denied local inflammation, purulent discharge, and systemic symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable apart from an allegedly benign breast nodule resection in her teenage years. In addition, her father died of metastatic cutaneous melanoma at 83 years old.Clinically, there was an ill-defined, infiltrated plaque with a normochromic, exophytic nodule on her scalp vertex measuring 4.2 × 3.8 cm (Figure, A). It had a waxy surface with irregular transverse furrows and overlying alopecia. Dermoscopic evaluation findings revealed a homogeneous yellow hue with no visible vascular or pigmented structures and absence of follicular ostia. The lesion was firm and mildly tender to the touch and seemed adherent to the underlying bone. There were no palpable lymph nodes. A brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed for further elucidation (Figure, B), as well as a punch biopsy (Figure, C and D).A, Clinical image of the lesion on the scalp.

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her early 70s with a history of a solitary, asymptomatic lump on her scalp that has been present since birth. The lesion has recently started to grow, and the patient is concerned about it. The physical examination reveals an ill-defined, infiltrated plaque with a normochromic, exophytic nodule on the scalp vertex measuring 4.2 × 3.8 cm. The lesion has a waxy surface with irregular transverse furrows and overlying alopecia. Dermoscopic evaluation findings reveal a homogeneous yellow hue with no visible vascular or pigmented structures and absence of follicular ostia. The lesion is firm and mildly tender to the touch and seems adherent to the underlying bone. There are no palpable lymph nodes. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further elucidation, as well as a punch biopsy. The MRI showed a non-enhancing mass in the scalp vertex. The biopsy revealed a cellular infiltration in the reticular dermis with monomorphic cells in a syncytial configuration surrounding collagen bundles.

The differential diagnosis for a solitary, asymptomatic lump on the scalp includes chondroid syringoma, cutaneous meningeal heterotopia, scalp metastasis, and proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus. Chondroid syringoma is a rare, benign tumor of the skin that typically presents as a small, asymptomatic papule or nodule. Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia is a rare, congenital anomaly in which a small piece of meningeal tissue is present in the skin. Scalp metastasis is a common metastatic site for tumors of the breast, lung, and skin. Proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus is a rare, benign condition that can occur in congenital melanocytic nevi.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is scalp metastasis. The patient is an older woman with a history of a solitary, asymptomatic lump on the scalp that has recently started to grow. The lesion is firm and mildly tender to the touch and seems adherent to the underlying bone. There are no palpable lymph nodes. The MRI showed a non-enhancing mass in the scalp vertex. The biopsy revealed a cellular infiltration in the reticular dermis with monomorphic cells in a syncytial configuration surrounding collagen bundles. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of scalp metastasis.

Title: Bilateral Atypical Eyelid Lesions in a 50-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 50-year-old woman was referred to the oculoplastic clinic for evaluation of bilateral vascular lesions of the eye visible beneath the palpebral conjunctivae on the upper and lower eyelids. She denied any vision changes or pain but did report a sensation of pressure in the location of the lesions, which was relieved when prone. She had a 25-year history of bulimia and was purging almost daily. She reported an inability to go more than 3 days at a time without purging and noted a reduction in the pressure and size of her lesions with respite from these daily episodes. She had no history of eye surgery, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or other risk factors for vascular disease. The patient first noticed these lesions 15 years ago in association with a subconjunctival hemorrhage on the left side. An orbital magnetic resonance image obtained at the time of that episode demonstrated a 2 × 0.6-cm focus of enhancement along the inferior and inferolateral palpebral tissues anterior to the left globe, suggestive of lymphangioma, hemangioma, or vascular malformation without other focal abnormalities. The anterior segment examination showed bilateral superior (Figure, A) and inferior (Figure, B) large dilated blood vessels underlying the palpebral conjunctivae. Complete ophthalmic and orbital examinations revealed no other abnormalities.Eyelids of the patient demonstrating vascular lesions visible within the palpebral tissue at the time of presentation. A, Atypical vascular dilation along the superior peripheral arcade of the right eye. The left eye had similar findings. B, Atypical vascular dilation along the inferior palpebral arcade of the left eye. The right eye had similar findings.Observe periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continuedWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a 25-year history of bulimia and is purging almost daily. She reported an inability to go more than 3 days at a time without purging and noted a reduction in the pressure and size of her lesions with respite from these daily episodes. This suggests that the lesions are likely related to her bulimia and are not a primary ophthalmic condition.

Sclerotherapy, surgical excision, and initiation of systemic administration of propranolol are all treatments that could be considered for a patient with a primary ophthalmic condition. However, these treatments would not be appropriate for this patient because they would not address the underlying cause of her lesions.

The most appropriate management for this patient is to observe her periocular lesions while her psychiatric treatment is continued. This will allow her to receive treatment for her bulimia, which is the underlying cause of her lesions. If her lesions do not improve with psychiatric treatment, then other treatment options could be considered.

Title: An Unusual Upper Eyelid Mass Case is: A 67-year-old Asian woman presented to her local ophthalmologist because of swelling of the left upper eyelid. Surgical drainage was performed, but the swelling persisted. Two months later, nontender preauricular fullness was noted, which prompted the patient to seek a second opinion. In the interim, magnetic resonance imaging of her orbit and parotid glands revealed focal enhancement in the left upper eyelid and superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. She was referred to us for diagnosis and treatment.On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Ocular motility was full, and proptosis was absent. The left upper eyelid was thickened (Figure 1A). Eyelid eversion was not possible in the clinic because of mass effect, but a small portion of the tumor was visualized at the supranasal eyelid margin. All eyelashes were intact. A nontender left preauricular mass of 1 cm in diameter was palpable. The remainder of the findings on eye examination were unremarkable. After eyelid eversion in the operating room, the mass measured 35 mm in basal diameter and 5 mm in thickness and demonstrated an amelanotic appearance with a hairpin-shaped vascular pattern suggestive of an epithelial tumor (Figure 1B).A, External photograph demonstrating left upper eyelid fullness. B, Everted left upper eyelid showing a diffuse, multinodular tarsal mass with hairpin-shaped vessels.What Would You Do Next? A: Administer topical interferon alfa-2b , B: Start external beam radiotherapy , C: Administer intralesional fluorouracil , D: Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a left upper eyelid mass that is suspicious for a malignancy. The most likely diagnosis is basal cell carcinoma, which is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, and it is usually slow-growing and not life-threatening. However, it can be locally destructive, and it can spread to other parts of the body if it is not treated.

The first step in the management of basal cell carcinoma is to obtain a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy can be performed in the office with a local anesthetic. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the treatment options will depend on the size and location of the tumor. Small tumors that are not in a cosmetically sensitive area can often be treated with topical chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Larger tumors or tumors in a cosmetically sensitive area may need to be surgically removed.

In this case, the patient has a large tumor that is in a cosmetically sensitive area. The most appropriate treatment option is to perform a complete posterior lamellar resection. This procedure involves removing the entire thickness of the eyelid, including the tumor, the conjunctiva, and the tarsus. The eyelid can then be reconstructed with a skin graft or a flap.

Title: Generalized Pruriginous Eruption on a Patient With Leukemia Case is: A woman in her 50s with a recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (subtype M5a, French-American-British classification) was admitted to the hospital for induction chemotherapy. At presentation she had a 3-week history of a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption. The patient otherwise felt well and denied fever, malaise, insect bites, or starting new drug treatments. Except for leukopenia and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level, results of other routine blood and urine tests were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed an erythematous eruption composed of small indurated and edematous papules (Figure, A and B). Confluent papules leading to large urticariform plaques, some with annular configuration, were present on the flanks, lower legs, breasts, and scalp. Hyperpigmented patches and focal areas of bruiselike discoloration were seen adjacent to acute lesions. Mucous membranes, palms, and soles were spared. A biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, C and D).A, Erythematous indurated and edematous papules and plaques on the thighs with some residual discoloration. B, Large erythematous plaques involving the scalp and ear. C, Hematoxylin-eosin–stained histologic specimen showing a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils (original magnification ×40). D, Higher magnification of C showing an abundant number of eosinophils in the infiltrate (original magnification ×400).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms , B: Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy , C: Urticarial vasculitis , D: Urticarial bullous pemphigoid. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is a hematologic malignancy. She presents with a 3-week history of a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption. The eruption is composed of small indurated and edematous papules, confluent papules leading to large urticariform plaques, some with annular configuration, and hyperpigmented patches and focal areas of bruiselike discoloration. Mucous membranes, palms, and soles are spared. A biopsy specimen shows a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy (EDHM).

EDHM is a rare skin disorder that occurs in patients with hematologic malignancies, such as AML. The exact cause of EDHM is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction to the malignancy. The most common symptoms of EDHM are a pruritic rash, fever, and weight loss. The rash is typically characterized by small, red papules that may coalesce to form larger plaques. The papules and plaques may be widespread, but they are often concentrated on the trunk and extremities. EDHM is a self-limited disorder that typically resolves within a few weeks or months. However, in some cases, the rash may be severe and persistent. Treatment of EDHM is generally supportive, with the goal of relieving symptoms and preventing complications. In some cases, immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary.

Title: Headache, Confusion, and Somnolence in a 27-Year-Old Woman Case is: A previously healthy 27-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion. She denied fevers or chills. She was born in Guatemala and had immigrated to the US approximately 1 year ago, without subsequent international travel. She took no medications. On examination, she was afebrile (36.8 °C) and hemodynamically stable, with heart rate 70/min and blood pressure 95/53 mm Hg. She was somnolent and confused without focal neurologic deficits. Serum white blood cell count was elevated to 14.9 ×109/L (86% segmented neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 0% basophils/eosinophils). A computed tomography scan of her brain was notable for diffuse ventriculomegaly and sulcal effacement consistent with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. Given her diminished level of consciousness, a ventriculostomy was placed emergently. Laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the ventriculostomy was notable for 40 red blood cells/mm3; 3 nucleated cells/mm3; protein level, 11 mg/dL; and glucose level, 73 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast demonstrated ventriculomegaly of the lateral and third ventricles, with a 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.6–cm nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius (Figure 1A). No abnormal meningeal enhancement or parenchymal lesion was identified. On hospital day 5, in the midst of an ongoing infectious diseases workup, the measured intracranial pressure and rate of CSF drainage from the ventriculostomy suddenly decreased. Repeat MRI demonstrated resolved hydrocephalus, a patent aqueduct of Sylvius, and the aforementioned nonenhancing lesion now located in the fourth ventricle (Figure 1B).Left, Sagittal T2-weighted noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image at presentation. Right, Sagittal T2-weighted noncontrast MRI image obtained on day 5 after sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and cerebrospinal fluid drainage.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of aqueductal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius, a narrow channel that connects the third and fourth ventricles of the brain. This can lead to hydrocephalus, a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. The patient's symptoms of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion are all consistent with hydrocephalus. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and CSF findings are also consistent with an inflammatory process, such as an infection.

The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of aqueductal stenosis. The nonenhancing lesion seen on the MRI is likely a granuloma, which is a collection of immune cells that can form in response to an infection. The granuloma is obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius, which is causing the hydrocephalus.

The patient's sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and CSF drainage from the ventriculostomy is likely due to spontaneous resolution of the aqueductal stenosis. This can happen in some cases, as the granuloma may resolve on its own. However, it is also possible that the patient's symptoms will recur.

The patient's best course of treatment is not clear. Some experts recommend observation without intervention, as the patient's symptoms may resolve on their own. Others recommend initiating anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids, as the granuloma may be caused by an infection. Still others recommend extracting the lesion surgically or diverting cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

The best course of treatment for this patient will depend on a number of factors, including the patient's age, overall health, and preferences. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment option with the patient and their family to make the best decision for their individual situation.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 2-week history of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion. She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable, but she is somnolent and confused without focal neurologic deficits. Her serum white blood cell count is elevated, and a computed tomography scan of her brain shows diffuse ventriculomegaly and sulcal effacement consistent with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. Given her diminished level of consciousness, a ventriculostomy was placed emergently. Laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the ventriculostomy shows 40 red blood cells/mm3; 3 nucleated cells/mm3; protein level, 11 mg/dL; and glucose level, 73 mg/dL.

Repeat MRI showed resolved hydrocephalus, a patent aqueduct of Sylvius, and the aforementioned nonenhancing lesion now located in the fourth ventricle.

The most likely diagnosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system, such as neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system in humans, and it is caused by the larvae of the tapeworm Taenia solium. The larvae are ingested in contaminated food or water, and they migrate to the brain, where they encyst and cause inflammation and damage. The clinical presentation of neurocysticercosis varies depending on the number and location of the cysts, as well as the immune status of the host. Common symptoms include headache, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. The diagnosis is made by imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan, and serologic testing. Treatment is with anthelminthic medications, such as albendazole or praziquantel.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are all consistent with a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis. The most appropriate next step is to initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids. Steroids are used to reduce inflammation and edema, which can help to improve the patient's clinical symptoms. Anthelminthic therapy is also necessary to kill the parasites and prevent further damage to the central nervous system.

Title: Dyschromic Nails, Exertional Dyspnea, and Lower Extremity Edema Case is: A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea presented with a 2-year history of nasal congestion, persistent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and chronic cough. Over the same period, he also developed thickened, brittle, and discolored fingernails and toenails. More recently, he developed progressive exertional dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities. He had no joint pain or swelling and no chest pain. He was taking amlodipine (5 mg daily) and ipratropium bromide nasal spray twice daily.On examination, he was afebrile. Heart rate was 66/min; blood pressure, 132/72 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18/min; and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, 97% on room air. He had yellow discoloration and thickening of his fingernails and toenails (Figure 1A). A few nails showed distal onycholysis. He had partially nonpitting edema of the lower extremities (Figure 1B). Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds at the lung bases but no rhonchi or crackles. Percussion of the lung bases and vocal resonance were normal. Cardiac and abdominal examination findings were unremarkable.A, Yellow discoloration and thickening of fingernails and toenails. Few nails showed distal onycholysis. B, Partially nonpitting edema of the lower extremities with a positive Stemmer sign (difficulty pinching the skin on the dorsum of the toes), suggestive of lymphedema.Laboratory testing revealed normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyrotropin level. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 2 mm/h; C-reactive protein level was 0.1 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive (1:160, nucleolar pattern), but results of testing for antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA were negative. He had mildly low C3 complement level (63 mg/dL [reference range, 79-152 mg/dL]), but normal C4 complement level (20 mg/dL [reference range, 16-38 mg/dL]). Immunoglobulin levels were normal. A chest radiograph performed within the last 6 months to evaluate his chronic cough did not reveal any obvious cardiopulmonary disease. His electrocardiogram was normal. An echocardiogram revealed normal left and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function and a small to moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.

Reasoning:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and nervous system. Common clinical manifestations of SLE include fatigue, fever, rash, joint pain, and anemia.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with SLE. The presence of a positive ANA is a sensitive but non-specific marker of SLE. The low C3 complement level is a more specific marker of SLE activity.

The chest radiograph and electrocardiogram are normal, which suggests that the patient's cardiac and pulmonary function are not significantly impaired. The CT scan of the sinuses shows bilateral maxillary and posterior ethmoidal sinusitis, which is a common finding in patients with SLE.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity. These tests will help to assess the patient's iron status. Iron deficiency is a common finding in patients with SLE, and it can contribute to the development of anemia.

An ileocolonoscopy revealed erythematous and congested mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations throughout the examined terminal ileum. Targeted biopsies were obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis. This is supported by the patient's history of recent initiation of capecitabine chemotherapy, the presence of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with ileitis, as well as the findings on imaging and colonoscopy. Cytomegalovirus ileitis is less likely, as the patient does not have any risk factors for this infection and his infectious workup was negative. Ileal metastasis is also less likely, as the patient's metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma is not known to involve the ileum and the imaging findings do not suggest a metastatic lesion. Small bowel carcinoid tumor is also less likely, as the patient does not have any symptoms or findings suggestive of this tumor.

Title: Progressive Vision Loss in a 62-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and bilateral peripheral iridotomies sought a second opinion for worsening visual acuity in the left eye for 2 months. She had been treated for glaucoma for approximately 1 year. Review of systems was negative for previous episodes of eye pain, redness, or emesis. Her medical history included hyperlipidemia, obesity, and prior cataract surgery in both eyes. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. The patient’s pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure was 11 mm Hg bilaterally without medication.

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and bilateral peripheral iridotomies. She has been treated for glaucoma for approximately 1 year. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 OD and 20/80 OS. The patient’s pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure is 11 mm Hg bilaterally without medication. Slitlamp findings were notable for patent peripheral iridotomies, open angles on gonioscopy, and an asymmetrically enlarged cup-disc ratio with mild pallor of the left optic nerve. Color vision was decreased in the left eye. Visual field (VF) testing as well as ganglion cell layer (GCL) segmentation by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were obtained for both eyes. The OCT showed nasal thinning of the right eye and diffuse thinning of the left eye. The relative thinning within the nasal macula compared with the temporal macula suggests injury to the papillomacular bundle. In the left eye, the diffuse thinning suggests diffuse optic nerve injury.

The most likely diagnosis is progressive visual loss due to glaucoma. The patient should be referred to a retina specialist for further evaluation and management. The retina specialist will be able to assess the severity of the glaucoma and recommend appropriate treatment options.

Title: Scleritis and Retinal Detachment After Strabismus Surgery in a Patient With Thyroid Eye Disease Case is: A 74-year-old man with an ocular history of bilateral cataract extraction 9 years prior and left inferior rectus muscle recession 3 months before this current evaluation for 2 months of severe, progressive pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. After strabismus surgery, he was noted to have a nonhealing conjunctival epithelial defect inferiorly, which later developed underlying scleral thinning. He was being treated with topical moxifloxacin, 0.5%, every 2 hours in the left eye. He noted a medical history of hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also noted a history of substantial blood glucose elevation after taking oral prednisone.A review of systems had negative results, including the absence of joint pain, fevers, chills, weight loss, and rashes. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and counting fingers OS, and his intraocular pressures were 13 mm Hg OD and 4 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed marked inferior redness, including large-caliber episcleral vessels and scleral thinning that was greatest inferonasally (Figure 1A). There was an epithelial defect overlying the thinned sclera, scleral tenderness to palpation, 16 to 25 cells per high-power field in the anterior chamber, and iris neovascularization. The view to the posterior pole was hazy, and B-scan ultrasonography revealed an inferior retinal detachment (Figure 1B).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of bilateral cataract extraction 9 years prior and left inferior rectus muscle recession 3 months before this current evaluation. He presented with 2 months of severe, progressive pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. After strabismus surgery, he was noted to have a nonhealing conjunctival epithelial defect inferiorly, which later developed underlying scleral thinning. He was being treated with topical moxifloxacin, 0.5%, every 2 hours in the left eye. He noted a medical history of hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also noted a history of substantial blood glucose elevation after taking oral prednisone.

On examination, the patient had marked inferior redness, including large-caliber episcleral vessels and scleral thinning that was greatest inferonasally. There was an epithelial defect overlying the thinned sclera, scleral tenderness to palpation, 16 to 25 cells per high-power field in the anterior chamber, and iris neovascularization. The view to the posterior pole was hazy, and B-scan ultrasonography revealed an inferior retinal detachment.

The patient's presentation is concerning for scleritis, a severe inflammatory condition of the sclera. Scleritis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases, infections, and medications. In the patient's case, the scleritis is likely secondary to his hyperthyroidism.

Scleritis can lead to a number of complications, including retinal detachment, which is a separation of the retina from the underlying choroid. Retinal detachment can cause severe vision loss, and it is a medical emergency.

The patient's retinal detachment is a surgical emergency. The patient should be admitted to the hospital and started on high-dose systemic steroids. He should also be referred to a retinal specialist for possible surgical repair of the retinal detachment.

Title: A Radiolucency Associated With an Impacted Mandibular Canine Tooth in an Adult Man Case is: A man in his 40s presented with mobility of the anterior mandibular dentition. A consultation with a dentist 1 year prior revealed an impacted mandibular canine (No. 22). He denied any pain, swelling, or paresthesia, and his medical history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed fullness on the mentolabial fold but no gross facial asymmetry or mental nerve paresthesia. Intraorally, there was an expansile mass of the left anterior mandible with ill-defined margins, which crossed the midline and obliterated the gingivolabial sulcus.Results of dental cone beam computed tomography imaging revealed a 4.3 × 4.0-cm radiolucent mandibular lesion with an unerupted mandibular canine in the center of the lesion, cortical destruction, and root deviation of teeth Nos. 23 through 26 (Figure, A). An incisional biopsy was performed, and the patient underwent radical mandibular resection 2 months later. Histological sections from the resection demonstrated nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded in a dense collagenous stroma (Figure, B). The lesion was centered in the cortical bone (Figure, C) and extended into the surrounding mucosa (Figure, D), fibroadipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Perineural invasion was identified (Figure, E), and lymphovascular invasion was absent. The tumor involved multiple margins. Immunohistochemistry findings revealed the tumor cells were positive for p40. Fluorescence in situ hybridization  studies demonstrated an EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 60% of the tumor cells (Figure, F).A, Dental cone beam computed tomography (CT) scan showing 4.3 × 4.0-cm radiolucent lesion in the anterior mandible with impacted mandibular canine at the center of the lesion.

**Reasoning:**

The patient in the case presented with a 4.3 × 4.0-cm radiolucent mandibular lesion with an unerupted mandibular canine in the center of the lesion, cortical destruction, and root deviation of teeth Nos. 23 through 26. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the patient underwent radical mandibular resection 2 months later. Histological sections from the resection demonstrated nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded in a dense collagenous stroma. The lesion was centered in the cortical bone and extended into the surrounding mucosa, fibroadipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Perineural invasion was identified, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. The tumor involved multiple margins. Immunohistochemistry findings revealed the tumor cells were positive for p40. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrated an EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 60% of the tumor cells.

Based on the clinical and pathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC). CCOC is a rare, aggressive malignancy that arises from odontogenic epithelium. It typically presents as a painless, expansile mass in the mandible or maxilla. Radiographically, CCOC appears as a well-defined radiolucency with cortical destruction. Histologically, CCOC is characterized by nests and cords of clear cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor cells are positive for p40 and EWSR1 gene rearrangement.

The differential diagnosis for CCOC includes odontogenic keratocyst, ameloblastoma, and salivary clear cell carcinoma. Odontogenic keratocyst is a benign odontogenic cyst that typically presents as a small, unilocular radiolucency. Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor that typically presents as a large, multilocular radiolucency. Salivary clear cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive malignancy that arises from salivary gland epithelium.

The treatment for CCOC is surgical resection with clear margins. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be considered in high-risk cases. The prognosis for CCOC is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30%.

**Answer:** C. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her 70s who presented with an enlarged and variegated plaque on her left axilla, which she had had for 4 years. The lesion started as a small eczematous, pink-to-brown plaque. As the lesion was asymptomatic and slow growing, she did not initially seek treatment. Recently, the color of the lesion had changed to an alarming dark brown color. No breast mass or lymphadenopathy was observed. Her medical and family history was unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for further histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings revealed an intraepidermal neoplasm consisting of pagetoid cells, characterized by round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm, and large pleomorphic nuclei. Immunohistochemical findings showed positive staining for EMA. The lesion was surrounded by numerous reactive dendritic HMB-45–positive melanocytes scattered among the tumor cells.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pigmented extramammary Paget disease (PEMP). PEMP is a rare, slow-growing, intraepithelial adenocarcinoma of apocrine glands. It typically presents as a single, well-demarcated, pigmented plaque on the anogenital or axillary skin. The lesion may be asymptomatic or may cause pruritus, burning, or pain. PEMP is more common in women than in men, and the average age of onset is 60 years.

The diagnosis of PEMP is made by biopsy. The histopathologic findings of PEMP are characteristic, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for EMA. Treatment for PEMP is surgical excision. In some cases, radiation therapy may be used as an adjunct to surgery. The prognosis for patients with PEMP is good, with most patients achieving long-term disease control with surgery.

Reasoning:

The patient is a middle-aged man who presents with a 3-month history of an asymptomatic nodule on his scalp. There are no systemic complaints, history of arthropod bite, immunosuppression, travel abroad, or contact with animals in the recent past. Physical examination reveals a skin-colored, firm, nontender, freely mobile 2 × 1.5-cm nodule with overlying normal skin on the right occipital region of the scalp. There is no lymphadenopathy. No other cutaneous lesions are present.

The histopathologic examination reveals a nodule in the dermis with an unremarkable epidermis. Cross-sections of parasites were present, surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The parasite showed an outer cuticle, muscle layer underneath, and gravid uterus filled with microfilariae. The cuticle demonstrated a wavy pattern of longitudinal ridges on its outer surface. The fibrous capsule contained mixed inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, histiocytes, and plasma cells.

The findings of slitlamp examination and fundoscopy of the eyes were normal. The findings of routine hematologic and biochemical investigations were normal. No microfilaria was seen in peripheral blood. The findings of chest radiography and abdomen ultrasonography were unremarkable.

Based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and negative laboratory investigations, the most likely diagnosis is subcutaneous dirofilariasis. Subcutaneous dirofilariasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis. The parasite is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, and the most common site of infection is the subcutaneous tissue. The clinical presentation of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is variable, and can range from asymptomatic to a localized nodule with surrounding inflammation. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination of the nodule, which reveals the characteristic cross-sections of the parasite. Treatment is with surgical excision of the nodule.

Title: Seemingly Innocuous Sore Throat in a 21-Year-Old Man Case is: A healthy 21-year-old Chinese man with no relevant medical history presented to multiple general practitioners for a recurrent sore throat associated with hoarseness of voice for 3 months’ duration. Despite having taken multiple courses of oral antibiotics, he saw no improvement in his symptoms. Over the course of 3 months, the patient went on to notice swelling and redness of his left ear (Figure 1A) that would resolve and recur every few weeks.Clinical photographs demonstrating auricular chondritis (A) and saddle nose deformity (B).Bothered by his hoarse voice and sore throat, he consulted a private otolaryngologist, who performed a nasoendoscopy, the results of which showed severe Reinke edema and chronic laryngitis. He was treated with a short course of oral prednisolone that alleviated all his symptoms.However, on cessation of oral steroids, the patient noticed a saddle-shaped deformity on his nose (Figure 1B) that appeared without any antecedent trauma. In addition, his hoarseness of voice worsened during a 2-week span and was now associated with difficulty breathing when he laid supine. In our otolaryngology clinic, physical examination results revealed a saddle-nose deformity, left pinna perichondritis, and a soft inspiratory stridor. He was unable to speak a full sentence without drawing a deep, labored breath. Laboratory test results showed elevated C-reactive protein levels of 143 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 97 mm/h, and a microcytic hypochromic anemia of hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10).

The results for antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.

The most likely diagnosis is relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and destruction of cartilage in multiple sites throughout the body. The most common sites of involvement are the ears, nose, and larynx. Other possible sites of involvement include the eyes, joints, skin, and heart.

The diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis is based on clinical findings, including a history of recurrent episodes of inflammation and destruction of cartilage, as well as laboratory findings, such as elevated levels of inflammatory markers. There is no specific test for relapsing polychondritis, and the diagnosis is often made after other possible causes have been excluded.

The treatment of relapsing polychondritis is aimed at controlling inflammation and preventing further damage to cartilage. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the mainstay of treatment. Other medications that may be used include immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace damaged cartilage.

The prognosis for relapsing polychondritis is variable. Some patients have mild disease that is easily controlled with medication. Others have more severe disease that can lead to significant disability or even death. The most common cause of death in patients with relapsing polychondritis is cardiovascular disease.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 60-year-old African American woman with a 1-day history of new floaters in her right eye. She has no relevant medical history, was not taking any systemic or ocular medications, and denied a history of floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/40 OU, and her intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg OU. An anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopy findings were notable for a vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye. Salmon-patch intraretinal hemorrhages were noted in the temporal peripheral retina of both eyes (Figure 1). Widefield fluorescein angiography revealed retinal capillary nonperfusion of the peripheral retina with neovascularization elsewhere, in a sea fan–like pattern, in both eyes. The patient denied any known history of sickle cell disease or trait and any family history of sickle disease. Scatter laser photocoagulation was performed on the nonperfused temporal retina in the right eye, and the left eye was observed.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with vitreous hemorrhage and retinal neovascularization includes sickle cell retinopathy, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and diabetic retinopathy. Sickle cell retinopathy is the most common cause of vitreous hemorrhage in African Americans. It is caused by occlusion of retinal capillaries by sickled red blood cells. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare genetic disorder that causes degeneration of the elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and arteries. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that causes damage to the blood vessels in the retina.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is sickle cell retinopathy. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The patient is an African American woman, which is a risk factor for sickle cell disease. She has a history of vitreous hemorrhage, which is a common complication of sickle cell retinopathy. The ophthalmoscopy findings are consistent with sickle cell retinopathy, with evidence of retinal capillary nonperfusion and neovascularization. The widefield fluorescein angiography findings are also consistent with sickle cell retinopathy.

The next step in management is to order hemoglobin electrophoresis to confirm the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient should be started on hydroxyurea therapy to reduce the risk of further complications. The patient should also be referred to a hematologist for further management.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the formation of non-necrotizing granulomas in multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and heart. The granulomas are formed by a mixture of activated T cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder.

The clinical presentation of sarcoidosis is variable and depends on the organs involved. The most common symptoms are fatigue, fever, malaise, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, eye problems, and cardiac problems.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The characteristic finding on chest imaging is bilateral hilar adenopathy. Other findings may include pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and bony lesions. Laboratory findings may include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level, and a positive serum test for angiotensin-converting enzyme.

The treatment of sarcoidosis is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment may include corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and other medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected organs or tissues.

The prognosis of sarcoidosis is variable. Most patients have a mild disease that resolves spontaneously. However, some patients have a more severe disease that requires long-term treatment. In rare cases, sarcoidosis can be fatal.

Reasoning: The patient is a 4-year-old girl with an asymptomatic, unilateral retinal mass. The mass is white and has no visible calcification or subretinal fluid. There is associated retinal pigment epithelium changes at the edge of the lesion. The left posterior segment is normal. The patient's medical history is unremarkable. Her immunizations are up to date, and she had had an uncomplicated prenatal and delivery course. Her ocular history and family history are unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for a retinal mass includes retinoblastoma, astrocytoma, and hemangioma. Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. It is a highly aggressive tumor that can spread to the central nervous system and other organs. Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that can also occur in the retina. Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes. Cardiac rhabdomyoma is a benign tumor of the heart muscle that is associated with tuberous sclerosis. Kidney cysts or tumors are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Title: Pruritus and Tense Bullae After Discontinuation of Pembrolizumab in a Patient With Renal Cell Carcinoma Case is: A 53-year-old woman with stage IV renal cell carcinoma was treated with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, for 20 months before developing a diffuse pruritic eruption recalcitrant to topical and oral corticosteroids. After 1 month of ongoing rash, pembrolizumab was discontinued. Her pruritic eruption persisted over the next 5 months despite treatment with up to 80 mg/d of oral prednisone. She did not report fever during this period. A shave biopsy performed while the patient was receiving systemic corticosteroids demonstrated spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate suggesting an incipient autoimmune bullous process. Results of follow-up direct immunofluorescence (DIF) performed on a sample taken 15 days after steroid discontinuation were negative. The eruption continued to worsen when the patient was not receiving systemic corticosteroids, with blisters developing 7.5 weeks after their discontinuation, prompting her presentation to the emergency department.On examination, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Blood pressure was elevated to 136/98 mm Hg; other vital signs were within normal limits. She had tense bullae and indurated papules and plaques involving the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, left), and oral mucosal erosions (Figure, right). Laboratory findings were notable for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level being elevated to 25 mm/h and 16.8 mg/dL, respectively, with a normal white blood cell count.Patient presentation.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of pembrolizumab-induced autoimmune bullous pemphigoid. This is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. The patient is currently not receiving any treatment, and her condition is worsening. She needs to be hospitalized and treated with intravenous fluids and wound care. A punch biopsy should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the rash. A different PD-1 inhibitor should not be started at this time, as this could worsen the patient's condition. Topical triamcinolone 0.5% cream is not an appropriate treatment for autoimmune bullous pemphigoid.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with stable atypical chest pain. She has a 20% pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), considering sex, age, and type of chest pain. Functional tests performed 3 months earlier were inconclusive. The patient has cardiovascular risk factors including arterial hypertension and a family history of CAD. With antihypertensive therapy, her blood pressure is 119/79 mm Hg. Blood lipids were as follows: total cholesterol, 167 mg/dL (abnormal >200 mg/dL); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 80 mg/dL (abnormal >100 mg/dL); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 55 mg/dL (abnormal <60 mg/dL); and triglycerides, 80 mg/dL (abnormal >150 mg/dL). To evaluate for CAD, she underwent coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, which showed no significant coronary stenosis.

The patient's symptoms are concerning for CAD, but the CT angiography results are reassuring. Given the patient's low pretest probability of CAD and the negative CT angiography results, further testing is not necessary at this time. However, the patient should be monitored closely for any changes in her symptoms. If her symptoms persist or worsen, she should be referred for further testing, such as stress testing or invasive coronary angiography.

**Answer:**

C. No stenosis or plaque. Because of high negative predictive value, no further testing is necessary.

Title: A Man With Widespread Arthritis and Ill-Defined Cutaneous Lesions Case is: A man in his 30s presented with a 3-month history of fourth finger right hand articular heat, pain, redness, and swelling. Similar symptoms subsequently spread to the left hallux and ankle, and he developed a fever. Despite many medical consultations and various attempts at treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, the patient developed widespread arthritis within the following month, which was predominant in the knee, shoulder, and hip. In the month before presentation the articular symptoms worsened, the joints had become tender, and ill-defined skin nodules had appeared predominantly on the legs (Figure, A and B). An acute abdominal pain in the left hypochondrium developed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which led to a diagnosis of pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital and clinical measures relieved the pain. Laboratory test results revealed strikingly high levels of lipase and amylase, as well as normal levels of cancer antigen 19-9. Bone computed tomography (CT) of the right shoulder and knee demonstrated cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis (Figure, C and D). An abdominal CT was performed (Figure, E), and the patient underwent surgery.Cancer-associated pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome (PPP) syndromeWhat Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: Optic Nerve Edema, Venous Stasis Retinopathy, and Peripheral Retinal Whitening in a Teenage Girl Case is: A teenage girl newly diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension by her neurologist presented with 2 weeks of headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, her Ishihara color plate findings were 10/10, and extraocular movements were intact in both eyes. An anterior slitlamp examination had unremarkable findings. A fundus examination showed hemorrhagic optic disc edema, peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, tortuous and dilated retinal vasculature, many intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants, and far peripheral temporal inner retinal whitening in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography demonstrated peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, and swollen optic nerve heads in both eyes (Figure 1B). A fluorescein angiogram showed markedly delayed venous filling (1 minute) in all quadrants and far peripheral capillary nonperfusion in both eyes.Images of the right eye at presentation.

Reasoning: The patient has optic nerve edema, venous stasis retinopathy, and peripheral retinal whitening. These findings are consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a diagnosis that was made by the patient's neurologist. IIH is a rare condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion. The most common symptom of IIH is headache, which is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and vision changes. The diagnosis of IIH is made based on clinical findings, including a history of headache and papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve head), as well as imaging studies, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and a lumbar puncture. There is no cure for IIH, but treatment options include weight loss, medications to reduce intracranial pressure, and surgery to relieve pressure on the optic nerves. In this case, the patient is a teenage girl with a recent diagnosis of IIH. She presents with a 2-week history of headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. There is no afferent pupillary defect, her Ishihara color plate findings are 10/10, and extraocular movements are intact in both eyes. An anterior slitlamp examination has unremarkable findings. A fundus examination shows hemorrhagic optic disc edema, peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, tortuous and dilated retinal vasculature, many intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants, and far peripheral temporal inner retinal whitening in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, and swollen optic nerve heads in both eyes. A fluorescein angiogram showed markedly delayed venous filling (1 minute) in all quadrants and far peripheral capillary nonperfusion in both eyes. The patient's workup for the optic nerve edema included magnetic resonance imaging and venography, which showed mild cerebral leptomeningeal enhancement and no occlusive thrombosis. A lumbar puncture revealed an elevated opening pressure of 50 cm H20 (38 mm Hg; normal range, 6-25 cm H20), an elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count (41 cells/μL; normal range, 0-5 cells/μL; to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), and negative cerebrospinal fluid culture results. A complete blood cell count found severe anemia (hemoglobin, 3.4 g/dL; normal range, 12.0-15.5 g/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), and a peripheral blood smear showed lymphocytosis with predominantly atypical lymphocytes. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 5850 mg/dL (normal range, 57-237 mg/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01). The patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of IIH. The next step in her management is to start treatment with medications to reduce intracranial pressure. The most commonly used medications for IIH are acetazolamide and furosemide. These medications work by decreasing the production of cerebrospinal fluid and increasing its absorption. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the optic nerves. The most common surgical procedure for IIH is a lumbar puncture with a large-bore needle (LP). This procedure allows for the removal of cerebrospinal fluid, which can decrease intracranial pressure. In conclusion, the patient has optic nerve edema, venous stasis retinopathy, and peripheral retinal whitening. These findings are consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a diagnosis that was made by the patient's neurologist. The next step in her management is to start treatment with medications to reduce intracranial pressure.

Title: Dysphagia and Pharyngeal Cyst Case is: A 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic cervical neck pain presented with complaints of globus sensation, dysphagia, and localized throat swelling. On examination, she had an approximately 1.5-cm mucosally covered mass on her left lateral pharyngeal wall that was cystlike in appearance. The remainder of her examination findings were normal. The patient reported that this cyst had been drained 2 years before with resolution of her symptoms. Contrasted computed tomographic (CT) imaging of her head and neck was obtained, which revealed a pharyngeal cyst that extended to the atlantoaxial joint (Figure, A). Further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the area was obtained, which demonstrated communication of the cyst with the atlantoaxial joint (Figure, B and C).Computed tomographic (CT) image (A) and magnetic resonance images (MRIs) (B and C) of the neck show a pharyngeal cyst (all images) that is communicating with the left atlantoaxial joint (B) at the level of the second cervical vertebra (C).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic cervical neck pain who presents with complaints of globus sensation, dysphagia, and localized throat swelling. On examination, she has an approximately 1.5-cm mucosally covered mass on her left lateral pharyngeal wall that is cystlike in appearance. The remainder of her examination findings are normal.

Further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the area was obtained, which demonstrated communication of the cyst with the atlantoaxial joint (Figure, B and C).

The most likely diagnosis is a Tornwaldt cyst. Tornwaldt cysts are congenital anomalies that arise from remnants of the notochord. They are typically located in the posterior pharyngeal wall, at the level of the second cervical vertebra. They can present with a variety of symptoms, including neck pain, dysphagia, globus sensation, and hearing loss. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

A juxtafacet cyst is a type of synovial cyst that arises from the joint capsule of a facet joint. It is typically located in the lumbar spine, but it can also occur in the cervical spine. Juxtafacet cysts can present with pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the affected joint. Treatment is typically conservative, with rest, ice, and physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary.

A mucus retention cyst is a type of cyst that arises from a gland in the lining of the nose or sinuses. It is typically filled with mucus and can cause pressure and pain in the affected area. Treatment is typically surgical removal of the cyst.

A spinal bronchogenic cyst is a rare type of cyst that arises from the lining of the lung. It is typically located in the lower thoracic or upper lumbar spine. Spinal bronchogenic cysts can present with pain, numbness, or weakness in the legs. Treatment is typically surgical removal of the cyst.

Title: Transient Vision Loss in a Healthy Older Woman Case is: A 72-year-old White woman, who was experiencing episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss for 2 weeks, was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. On examination, visual acuity was 20/30 OU. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 16 mm Hg OD and 41 mm Hg OS. The anterior segment was normal in the right eye. Anterior examination of the left eye revealed 10% hyphema. The patient was prescribed cyclopentolate, 1%, and prednisolone acetate, 1%, to reduce inflammation and lower the IOP in the left eye. Two days later, IOP was 16 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp biomicroscopy revealed resolved hyphema and abnormal blood vessels at the superotemporal pupillary margin of the iris, prompting referral for further evaluation.On further examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, and IOP was 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination results in the right eye appeared normal, whereas the left eye demonstrated subtle, multifocal ectatic vascular channels arranged circumferentially at the pupillary margin (Figure 1A, arrowheads). On fluorescein angiography (FA), both the right and left irises displayed multifocal, pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence at the pupillary margin and was more noticeable on the left iris (Figure 1B, arrowheads).

The correct answer is A. Observe until repeated incident.

The patient is a 72-year-old White woman who has been experiencing episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss for 2 weeks. On examination, her visual acuity is 20/30 OU. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is 16 mm Hg OD and 41 mm Hg OS. The anterior segment is normal in the right eye. Anterior examination of the left eye reveals 10% hyphema. The patient was prescribed cyclopentolate, 1%, and prednisolone acetate, 1%, to reduce inflammation and lower the IOP in the left eye. Two days later, IOP was 16 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp biomicroscopy revealed resolved hyphema and abnormal blood vessels at the superotemporal pupillary margin of the iris, prompting referral for further evaluation.

On further examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, and IOP was 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination results in the right eye appeared normal, whereas the left eye demonstrated subtle, multifocal ectatic vascular channels arranged circumferentially at the pupillary margin (Figure 1A, arrowheads). On fluorescein angiography (FA), both the right and left irises displayed multifocal, pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence at the pupillary margin and was more noticeable on the left iris (Figure 1B, arrowheads). The remainder of the eye examination was unremarkable, and there was no sign of neovascularization of the retina or disc.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of rubeosis iridis. Rubeosis iridis is a condition characterized by neovascularization of the iris. It is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus and can lead to blindness if not treated promptly.

The treatment of rubeosis iridis is aimed at reducing the risk of blindness. This may include laser photocoagulation of the new blood vessels, panretinal photocoagulation, or vitrectomy. In some cases, iridocyclectomy may be necessary to remove the entire iris.

In the case of this patient, the best course of action is to observe her until she has another episode of transient vision loss. If she does have another episode, then she should be treated with laser photocoagulation of the new blood vessels.

Reasoning:

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of rubeosis iridis. Rubeosis iridis is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus and can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. However, the patient has not had any episodes of permanent vision loss. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe her until she has another episode of transient vision loss. If she does have another episode, then she should be treated with laser photocoagulation of the new blood vessels.

Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils, and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2).

IgG4-related disease is a systemic disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into various organs and tissues. The most common sites of involvement are the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, kidneys, lungs, and skin. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic findings. The treatment of IgG4-related disease is generally with corticosteroids, although other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary in some cases.

In the case presented, the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient is a young woman with no history of drug abuse who presents with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity. She denies systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. Her medical history is negative for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. Her family history is noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrated synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. Her immune workup showed elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils, and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2).

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease.

Title: Chest Pain in a Middle-aged Woman With Asthma Case is: A woman in her 50s with discoid lupus in remission and recent adult-onset asthma presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion associated with substernal chest pain radiating to her jaw. She noted a 5-kg weight loss in the preceding 3 months. Examination revealed nonreproducible chest tenderness, bibasilar crackles, and no extra heart sounds. A 12-lead electrocardiogram is shown in Figure 1A. Testing revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 16 900 cells/μL [to convert to × 109 cells/L, multiply by 0.001]) with a differential of 6% neutrophils and 59% eosinophils, an elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide of 3963 pg/mL (reference level, <900 pg/mL [to convert to ng/L, multiply by 1.0]), and an elevated initial troponin T of 0.36 ng/mL, which later peaked at 0.41 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0). Her C-reactive protein level was 3.09 mg/dL (normal, <0.5 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10]). Subsequent plasma flow cytometry demonstrated 65% eosinophils, and a bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemistry showed eosinophilia without evidence of clonal expansion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed (Figure 1B; Video).A, Normal sinus rhythm with left-axis deviation, low voltages, inferior Q waves, and poor R-wave progression.

The correct answer is: **C: Urgently start high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during hospitalization**

Reasoning:

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute eosinophilic myocarditis, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of asthma, which is a known risk factor for eosinophilic myocarditis, as well as the patient's laboratory findings, which show leukocytosis with eosinophilia, elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and elevated troponin T. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings of foci of delayed mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement, diffuse pericardial thickening, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a small pericardial effusion are also consistent with the diagnosis of acute eosinophilic myocarditis.

The treatment of acute eosinophilic myocarditis is typically with high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The steroids and colchicine help to reduce inflammation, while the NSAIDs help to reduce pain and fever. The patient should be hospitalized for close monitoring and treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect:

* **A: Place percutaneous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery** is incorrect because the patient's chest pain is not due to coronary artery disease.
* **B: Start colchicine and NSAIDs, with outpatient follow-up in 4 weeks** is incorrect because the patient requires hospitalization for treatment with high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
* **D: Urgently drain pericardial effusion percutaneously** is incorrect because the patient does not have a large pericardial effusion that requires drainage.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 60s with a widespread, intermittently pruritic eruption. Examination shows coalescing annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques in a concentric pattern diffusely involving the chest, back, and abdomen with extension to proximal extremities. Punch biopsies from the chest and back were obtained for histopathology and tissue culture. Treatment with topical corticosteroids under wet dressings was associated with partial improvement in the eruption and pruritus.

The most likely diagnosis is erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides. Erythema gyratum repens is a rare, paraneoplastic skin eruption that is associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly lung adenocarcinoma. The eruption is characterized by annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques that often have a concentric pattern. The eruption is typically pruritic and may be associated with fever, weight loss, and other systemic symptoms.

The histopathology of erythema gyratum repens typically shows epidermal hyperplasia with spongiosis and parakeratosis. There is a superficial dermal and epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes focally distributed along the dermal-epidermal junction and aggregated in Pautrier microabscesses. Immunohistochemical staining for CD30 is typically positive.

The treatment of erythema gyratum repens is aimed at the underlying malignancy. In cases of lung adenocarcinoma, treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Treatment of the skin eruption itself is supportive and may include topical corticosteroids, wet dressings, and oral antihistamines.

Title: An African American Man With Progressive Loss of Iris Pigmentation in Both Eyes Case is: A 37-year-old African American man in good health presented to the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary in Chicago. The patient noted 4 years of progressive, decreased, patchy pigmentation of both eyes; constant photophobia; and constant decreased visual acuity. He had a history of high myopia and a family history of glaucoma in a female family member. He denied other prior ocular history, trauma, or eye surgery. A review of systems had no remarkable findings, and the patient denied a prodromal viral illness.On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20-2 OD and 20/25 OS, with a refraction of −6.25 OD and −5.50 OS (spherical equivalent). The intraocular pressure was 18 OU. Gonioscopy showed openness to the ciliary body with 1+ trabecular meshwork pigmentation, without synechiae or angle recession in either eye. A slitlamp examination demonstrated quiet conjunctiva, clear corneas, deep and quiet anterior chambers, mid-dilated round pupils, patchy iris atrophy, and transillumination defects bilaterally (Figure).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 37-year-old African American man with progressive loss of iris pigmentation in both eyes. He also has a history of high myopia and a family history of glaucoma in a female family member. On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20-2 OD and 20/25 OS, with a refraction of −6.25 OD and −5.50 OS (spherical equivalent). The intraocular pressure is 18 OU. Gonioscopy showed openness to the ciliary body with 1+ trabecular meshwork pigmentation, without synechiae or angle recession in either eye. A slitlamp examination demonstrated quiet conjunctiva, clear corneas, deep and quiet anterior chambers, mid-dilated round pupils, patchy iris atrophy, and transillumination defects bilaterally. Ophthalmoscopy showed an 0.8 cup-disc ratio without notching bilaterally but had otherwise normal results. Retinal nerve fiber layer optical coherence tomography showed borderline thinning with normal Humphrey visual fields in both eyes.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pigmentary glaucoma, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, and uveitis. Pigmentary glaucoma is a rare, bilateral, non-inflammatory glaucoma that is characterized by progressive loss of iris pigmentation, transillumination defects, and open angles. Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis is a chronic, non-granulomatous uveitis that is characterized by heterochromia iridis, iris atrophy, and anterior chamber inflammation. Uveitis is a general term for inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is pigmentary glaucoma. This is supported by the patient's history of progressive loss of iris pigmentation, his bilateral presentation, his open angles, and his borderline retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis is less likely because the patient does not have heterochromia iridis. Uveitis is also less likely because the patient does not have any signs of inflammation, such as anterior chamber cells or flare.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform anterior segment fluorescein angiography (ASFA). ASFA is a diagnostic test that uses a dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It can be used to diagnose pigmentary glaucoma and to monitor the progression of the disease.

**Reasoning:**
The patient presents with progressive loss of iris pigmentation, photophobia, and decreased visual acuity. He has a history of high myopia and a family history of glaucoma. On examination, he has patchy iris atrophy and transillumination defects bilaterally. Ophthalmoscopy shows an 0.8 cup-disc ratio without notching bilaterally but has otherwise normal results. Retinal nerve fiber layer optical coherence tomography shows borderline thinning with normal Humphrey visual fields in both eyes.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pigmentary glaucoma, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, and Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. Pigmentary glaucoma is a bilateral, slowly progressive form of glaucoma that is characterized by pigmentary dispersion from the iris and trabecular meshwork. Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis is a bilateral, non-inflammatory condition that is characterized by iris atrophy, heterochromia, and posterior synechiae. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a congenital disorder that is characterized by iris hypoplasia, corectopia, and anterior chamber anomalies.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform anterior segment fluorescein angiography. This test will help to assess the patency of the anterior chamber angle and the presence of any neovascularization. If the patient has pigmentary glaucoma, the anterior segment fluorescein angiography will show diffuse hyperfluorescence of the iris and trabecular meshwork. If the patient has Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis, the anterior segment fluorescein angiography will show patchy hyperfluorescence of the iris and ciliary body. If the patient has Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, the anterior segment fluorescein angiography will show an abnormal pattern of iris and ciliary body vascularity.

Title: Enhancing Skull Base Structure Along the Carotid Sheath in a Patient With Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Case is: A 62-year-old man with a prior 10–pack-year history of smoking presented with a 3-cm right level IIa lymph node. Fine-needle aspiration results showed metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. No mucosal primary site was identified with positron emission tomography, computed tomography, or a head and neck examination. The patient underwent direct laryngoscopy with directed biopsies and bilateral tonsillectomy. Pathology results revealed a 1.8-cm primary cancer in the right tonsil, and the patient received a stage designation of T1 N1 M0. The tumor was intracapsular, and all surgical margins were negative. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion concluded that surgical and nonsurgical treatment options were available, and the patient elected to proceed with further surgery, which would entail additional directed biopsies at the primary site with additional resection if necessary and selective neck dissection of levels Ib to IV. In preparation for the neck dissection, computed tomography of the neck with contrast was obtained. Imaging results revealed an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath (Figure).Computed tomography of the neck with contrast and the axial (A) and coronal (B) views revealing an enhancing structure at the skull base along the carotid sheath (arrowheads).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning: The patient has a history of smoking and a 3-cm right level IIa lymph node that was found to be metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. No mucosal primary site was identified with positron emission tomography, computed tomography, or a head and neck examination. The patient underwent direct laryngoscopy with directed biopsies and bilateral tonsillectomy, which revealed a 1.8-cm primary cancer in the right tonsil.

Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion concluded that surgical and nonsurgical treatment options were available, and the patient elected to proceed with further surgery, which would entail additional directed biopsies at the primary site with additional resection if necessary and selective neck dissection of levels Ib to IV. In preparation for the neck dissection, computed tomography of the neck with contrast was obtained. Imaging results revealed an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath.

The most likely diagnosis is a persistent trigeminal artery. A persistent trigeminal artery is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the trigeminal artery fails to regress during fetal development. The trigeminal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that normally regresses during the second trimester of pregnancy. If it fails to regress, it can persist into adulthood and cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, facial pain, and seizures.

The diagnosis of a persistent trigeminal artery is often made on imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging studies may show an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath.

The treatment for a persistent trigeminal artery is usually surgical. The goal of surgery is to remove the persistent trigeminal artery and relieve any symptoms that are being caused by it.

Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for a diagnosis of Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that can affect the eyes, skin, joints, and gastrointestinal tract. The most common ocular manifestation of Behcet's disease is retinal vasculitis, which can lead to retinal hemorrhages, neovascularization, and macular edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain are indicated to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brain tumor or a vascular malformation. A vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not indicated in the absence of clinical suspicion of a viral infection. Administering an intravitreal injection of foscarnet is a treatment option for retinal vasculitis caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, but it is not indicated in the absence of definitive evidence of CMV infection.

Title: In the Context of Cicatricial Disease Case is: A woman in her 60s with a history of hypothyroidism presented with a 6-month history of progressive, diffuse redness and tearing in the left eye. She maintained a healthy diet and denied any history of malnutrition, gastrointestinal procedures, recent ocular infections, or chemical exposures. Her ocular history was notable for cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation in both eyes. Shortly after cataract surgery in the left eye, performed 1 year prior to presentation, the patient developed cystoid macular edema treated with a sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide. Ocular hypertension was noted after corticosteroid treatment, and the patient started brimonidine-timolol drops twice daily in the left eye.At presentation, the patient’s corrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS. She denied diplopia. Results of slitlamp examination revealed very mild shortening of the fornix inferonasally in the right eye. She had extensive keratinization of her conjunctiva in the left eye from the 3-o’clock to 10-o’clock positions with mild underlying hyperemia (Figure 1A), with neovascular fronds at the superior corneoscleral limbus (Figure 1B) and extensive shortening of the inferior fornix.Extensive keratinization over the inferior bulbar conjunctiva (arrowhead) (A) and neovascular fronds extending across the superior limbus (arrowhead) (B).Start treatment with frequent artificial tears 4 times daily and follow up in 6 monthsTest for vitamin A deficiency, with additional conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune depositsObserve after stopping brimonidine-timolol drops without further intervention or evaluationPerform extensive excision of the lesion with ocular surface reconstruction, followed by disposal of the biopsy specimenWhat Would You Do Next?

The correct answer is **B: Test for vitamin A deficiency, with additional conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits.**

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can lead to vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of healthy epithelial tissues, including the conjunctiva. Deficiency can lead to keratinization, inflammation, and scarring of the conjunctiva.

The patient also has neovascular fronds at the superior corneoscleral limbus, which can be a sign of ocular surface inflammation. Ocular surface inflammation can be caused by a number of conditions, including vitamin A deficiency.

Therefore, it is important to test for vitamin A deficiency in this patient. If the patient is vitamin A deficient, she will need to be treated with oral vitamin A supplements. In addition, she may need to have conjunctival biopsies to rule out other causes of her ocular surface inflammation.

The other answer choices are not appropriate.

* Answer A is not appropriate because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Frequent artificial tears will only provide temporary relief of her symptoms.
* Answer C is not appropriate because it does not rule out other possible causes of the patient's condition. It is important to test for vitamin A deficiency before stopping any medications.
* Answer D is not appropriate because it is too aggressive. There is no evidence that the patient's condition is malignant. Excision of the lesion would be a major surgery with significant risks.

On admission, punch biopsies of the skin were performed for both histological examination and bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacterial cultures.

The most likely diagnosis is Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is a rare, acute, febrile, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and tender, erythematous, edematous papules and plaques that often ulcerate. It can occur as a primary disease or secondary to a number of underlying conditions, including hematologic malignancies, infections, drugs, and inflammatory bowel disease. The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with Sweet syndrome, including her age, the rapid onset and progression of her skin lesions, the presence of fever and leukocytosis, and the absence of any other obvious underlying cause.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas and necrotizing vasculitis in affected tissues. The patient in this case does not have any features that are consistent with GPA, such as pulmonary infiltrates, renal involvement, or a positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test.

Cryptococcal infection is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, meninges, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in patients with AIDS or other immunocompromised conditions. The patient in this case does not have any features that are consistent with cryptococcal infection, such as a history of HIV infection or other immunosuppressive conditions.

Drug-induced vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that can be caused by a number of different drugs, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and chemotherapeutic agents. The patient in this case does not have any history of taking any drugs that are known to cause vasculitis.

**Answer:** The diagnosis is Sweet syndrome.

Answer not available
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presents with a week of painless, rapidly progressive, edematous, necrotic papules and plaques on the extremities, buttocks, and face with sharp demarcation at the nasolabial folds and extension into the oral mucosa. She also has a 4-month history of extreme fatigue, 20.4 kg weight loss, and a recent episode of hematochezia. Her medical history is significant for a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She is afebrile and hemodynamically stable, but laboratory evaluation reveals that she has leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, and proteinuria. On hospital day 2, she developed bright red blood per rectum, necessitating transfusion. A computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed parenchymal lung nodules. On admission, punch biopsies of the skin were performed for both histological examination and bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacterial cultures.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes a number of vasculitic syndromes, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Sweet syndrome, and drug-induced vasculitis. GPA is a systemic vasculitis that predominantly affects the small and medium-sized arteries. It is characterized by necrotizing inflammation of the respiratory tract, kidneys, and skin. Sweet syndrome is a rare, self-limited febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by painful, tender, erythematous plaques and bullae. Drug-induced vasculitis is a hypersensitivity reaction to a medication that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels.

The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of GPA. Her history of pneumonia suggests that she may have had an initial infection that triggered the vasculitis. Her laboratory findings are consistent with vasculitis, including leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, and proteinuria. The imaging findings of parenchymal lung nodules are also consistent with vasculitis. The biopsy specimens show evidence of necrotizing inflammation of the blood vessels, which is diagnostic of GPA.

The patient was treated with a combination of steroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. She responded well to treatment and her symptoms resolved. She was discharged from the hospital after 2 weeks of treatment and is currently being followed as an outpatient.

Title: A Patient With Back Pain and Morning Stiffness Case is: A 44-year-old White man presented with a 15-year history of dull midline lower back pain associated with bilateral hip pain. He also noted bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes. Family history was notable for a brother with osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes.Vital signs were within normal limits (heart rate, 92/min; blood pressure, 136/84 mm Hg; respiratory rate,  16/min; oxygen saturation, 97%; temperature, 37.0 °C). Musculoskeletal examination revealed swelling of the second, third, and fifth MCP joints and second and third PIP joints bilaterally as well as decreased knee and hip range of motion with minimal knee effusions. Lower back flexion was decreased with only 4-mm excursion on the modified Schober test. Results of cardiopulmonary, abdominal, neurologic, and dermatologic examinations were unremarkable.Results of laboratory testing, including complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, were within normal limits, and results for HLA-B27 were negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8 mm/h and C-reactive protein level was 0.5 mg/dL.

**Reasoning:** The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the sacroiliac joints and spine. AS is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, meaning that it is not associated with the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF). Radiographs of the hands and pelvis show characteristic findings of AS, including sclerosis and joint narrowing at the sacroiliac joints and joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for the diagnosis of AS.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 60s with a history of AML who has undergone an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 13 months earlier. He presents with asymptomatic green-gray nodules on the chest that have been stable since onset 4 months prior.

Chloroma is a rare, aggressive form of leukemia that can present with skin lesions. It is typically seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as in this case. Chloromas are typically green or blue-green in color, which is consistent with the patient's presentation.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that can also present with green or blue-green skin lesions. However, Merkel cell carcinoma is more common in older adults, and it is not typically seen in patients with a history of AML.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that can also present with skin lesions. However, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is typically seen in younger adults, and it is not typically seen in patients with a history of AML.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, inflammatory condition that can present with skin lesions. However, histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is not typically seen in patients with a history of AML.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is chloroma.

Title: Encephalomyelitis and Lymphadenopathy in a Man in His Early 40s Case is: A white man in his early 40s presented with dizziness and fatigue followed by tingling of both lower extremities as well as gait disturbances. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable besides mild intermittent whole-body itching starting 9 months prior. Physical examination revealed mild proximal pyramidal weakness of the left leg (Medical Research Council grade 4/5), with brisk reflexes and extensor plantar response as well as hypoesthesia below the T2 level without sphincter disturbances. In addition, mild decrement in position sense and marked decrement of vibration sense were observed in both lower extremities. No skin lesions were detected, while cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes were enlarged. Multiple enhancing lesions were observed on brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was acellular, and eosinophils and oligoclonal bands were not detected, while proteins, glucose, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were within normal range. Test results for B-cell clones, viral, and fungal infections were all negative. Routine blood test results were unremarkable besides an elevated eosinophilic count (2.76 K/μL;17.6%). Antibodies for AQP4, MOG, and paraneoplastic syndromes were not detected. Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography demonstrated generalized lymphadenopathy without any other pathological findings. Whole-body gallium scan, chest high-resolution computed tomography, and bone marrow biopsy results were normal, while axillary and inguinal lymph node biopsies revealed nonspecific reactive lymphadenopathy. Parasitic infections were excluded by plasma and CSF antibodies testing with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, stool, and lymph node microscopy.

A posterior pole examination was limited by corneal edema, but there was evidence of a vitreous hemorrhage. The fellow eye had no corneal edema and was pseudophakic, with prior panretinal photocoagulation scars in the peripheral retina.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is acute allergic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), which is a hypersensitivity reaction of the conjunctiva and cornea to an allergen. The most common allergens associated with AKC are pollen, dust mites, and pet dander. The patient's history of handling a plant in her garden is consistent with an allergic reaction to a plant-based allergen.

The initial treatment for AKC is to remove the allergen from the environment and to start topical corticosteroid eyedrops. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops help to reduce inflammation and swelling of the conjunctiva and cornea. In severe cases, oral corticosteroids may also be necessary.

The patient in this case should be started on a course of topical corticosteroid eyedrops and oral antihistamines. She should also be advised to avoid contact with the plant that she believes caused her reaction. She should be seen back in the clinic in 1 week for a follow-up examination.

Title: Acute Ptosis in a Middle-aged Man With Hypertension Case is: A 56-year-old man with hypertension presented with 2 weeks of acute ptosis in the left upper eyelid. Three weeks prior, the patient had noted severe left-sided facial pain. He denied any diplopia, decreased vision, or recent trauma. The patient had previously been evaluated by his primary care physician and referred to a neuroophthalmologist. During the course of the workup, the patient had undergone computed tomography (CT) of the head and chest, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and carotid duplex ultrasonography. Following a workup with unremarkable results, the patient presented to the Bascom Palmer emergency department for a second opinion.On initial examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure, ocular motility, and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was no axial proptosis or enophthalmos by exophthalmometry. The pupil was 5 mm OD and 4 mm OS. No afferent pupillary defect was observed. External examination demonstrated a left-sided ptosis (Figure 1). Anhidrosis was not observed. Anterior and posterior examination, including of the optic nerve head, had normal results in both eyes. The cranial nerve, gross motor, and gross sensory examination had otherwise unremarkable results. The patient’s blood pressure was 160/79 mm Hg.External photograph demonstrating ptosis of the left upper eyelid.Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neckWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with hypertension who presents with 2 weeks of acute ptosis in the left upper eyelid. The ptosis is likely due to third nerve palsy, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, aneurysm, and tumor. The patient's history of severe left-sided facial pain is concerning for a temporal arteritis, which can also cause third nerve palsy. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 OU, which suggests that the ptosis is not causing significant visual impairment. The patient's intraocular pressure, ocular motility, and confrontational visual fields are normal, which further suggests that the ptosis is not causing significant visual impairment. The patient has no axial proptosis or enophthalmos by exophthalmometry, which suggests that the ptosis is not due to Graves' disease. The pupil is 5 mm OD and 4 mm OS, and there is no afferent pupillary defect. This suggests that the ptosis is not due to Horner's syndrome. External examination demonstrates a left-sided ptosis. Anhidrosis is not observed. Anterior and posterior examination, including of the optic nerve head, have normal results in both eyes. The cranial nerve, gross motor, and gross sensory examination have otherwise unremarkable results. The patient's blood pressure is 160/79 mm Hg.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck. This will help to identify any vascular abnormalities that may be causing the third nerve palsy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass. Computed tomography–guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass revealed a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm.

The most likely diagnosis is myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma is a rare, aggressive form of cancer that arises from myeloid progenitor cells. It is most commonly seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it can also occur in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The most common presenting symptoms of myeloid sarcoma are fever, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy. On imaging studies, myeloid sarcoma typically appears as a large, heterogeneous mass. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows a dense infiltrate of myeloid cells.

The treatment for myeloid sarcoma is chemotherapy. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission, which is defined as the absence of detectable disease. Remission can be achieved in about 50% of patients with myeloid sarcoma. However, the disease is often resistant to treatment, and relapse is common. The median survival for patients with myeloid sarcoma is about 12 months.

Title: Retinal Whitening After Lung Transplant for Cystic Fibrosis Case is: A man in his mid-20s with cystic fibrosis (CF) underwent bilateral lung transplant. Four weeks after the transplant, the patient developed acute vision loss of the left eye. Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and hand motion OS. Anterior segment was remarkable for 1+ hyperemia and 4+ anterior chamber (AC) cell in the left eye. Posterior segment was notable for retinal whitening and occlusive vasculitis in the right eye and more extensive retinal whitening associated with an exudative retinal detachment in the left eye. Microbial and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and culture results of the AC and vitreous were negative as well as numerous blood cultures and serum fungitell. Despite broad-spectrum intravenous (ie, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime), antifungals (amphotericin B and voriconazole), and antivirals (foscarnet), the patient’s visual acuity and intraocular inflammation worsened in both eyes to light perception. Over a week, the areas of retinal whitening became elevated owing to enlarging subretinal infiltrates (Figure, A) that were nearly kissing in the right eye (Figure, B). Owing to the diagnostic dilemma, a pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy was performed in the left eye, and again, microbiological analysis including culture and PCR analysis was inconclusive. Pain worsened, intraocular pressure elevated into the mid-40s mm Hg, visual acuity waned to no light perception, and intraocular inflammation and subretinal infiltrates continued to worsen, producing nearly closed funnel retinal detachments in both eyes, including developing orbital cellulitis in the right eye despite broad-spectrum antimicrobials. During this period, the patient remained afebrile; however, the patient’s white blood cell count was uptrending, raising concern for systemic spread of the infection.A, Intraoperative images from the diagnostic vitrectomy and subretinal biopsy performed on the left eye showing substantial hemorrhagic retinitis with subretinal infiltrate (white arrowhead).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The patient has a severe retinal infection that has not responded to broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient's visual acuity has worsened to no light perception, and there is evidence of systemic spread of the infection. The patient is at risk of losing both eyes and developing life-threatening complications.

In this situation, it is important to continue to treat the infection aggressively with the best available medications. However, it is also important to consider the risks and benefits of each treatment option. Intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications are a safe and effective way to deliver medications directly to the eye. However, these injections can be painful and may cause inflammation. Repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy is a more invasive procedure that carries a higher risk of complications, such as infection and retinal detachment.

In this case, I would recommend continuing intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications. I would also consider adding systemic immunosuppressive therapy to help reduce the inflammation and improve the patient's immune response to the infection. I would also monitor the patient closely for signs of systemic spread of the infection and would be prepared to intervene with additional treatment if necessary.

The patient is a young girl who presented with an inflammatory plaque on her left index finger that had started as a light erythema a few months before. The lesion was initially treated with an oral antibiotic (amoxicillin) and antiviral (acyclovir) without improvement. There was no relevant medical history. The family reported living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast.

The physical examination findings revealed an inflammatory erythematous plaque with a central shiny orange crust on the left index finger. No other fingers were affected. There were no systemic symptoms or family history of similar lesions.

Given the chronic course, with no improvement with empiric therapy, a biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation. The histopathologic examination showed a diffuse dermatitis with epithelioid granulomas. Intracellular amastigotes were identified in the dermal macrophages.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis. This is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania species. The infection is transmitted by the bite of infected sandflies. The most common clinical presentation is a single, chronic, ulcerative lesion on the exposed skin. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination or serologic testing.

The treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis depends on the species of Leishmania involved, the clinical presentation, and the immune status of the patient. The most common treatments are pentavalent antimony, miltefosine, and liposomal amphotericin B.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA. CMV is a common viral infection that can cause inflammation in the eye, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. In this patient, the clinical presentation of new KPs in coin-shaped aggregates along with new AC inflammation is highly suggestive of CMV endotheliitis. PCR of aqueous humor for CMV DNA is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing CMV endotheliitis. If the test is positive, the patient can be treated with antiviral therapy, such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. Treatment with antiviral therapy is usually effective in resolving CMV endotheliitis and preventing further damage to the cornea.

Reasoning:

The patient's clinical presentation of new KPs in coin-shaped aggregates along with new AC inflammation is highly suggestive of CMV endotheliitis. CMV is a common viral infection that can cause inflammation in the eye, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. In this patient, the patient's age, systemic hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and history of postphacoemulsification bullous keratopathy make her at increased risk for CMV endotheliitis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of arthritis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and glaucoma. She presents with a several-year history of frontal pain, pressure, clear nasal discharge, and progressive nontender facial swelling above her glabella. She denies nasal disturbance, prior sinus surgery, asthma, or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) sensitivity. Symptoms were refractory to treatment with several rounds of oral antibiotics and oral steroids. Physical examination findings revealed symmetric facial movement with prominent glabellar swelling and soft tissue thickening. Nasal endoscopy findings revealed a soft tissue mass anterior to the axilla of the middle turbinates bilaterally, with normal-appearing mucosa overlying. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for further evaluation (Figure, A). Recommendations were made to proceed to the operating room for biopsy of the nasal mass. Pathology results revealed uniform, epithelioid cells arranged in a whorled, lobulated growth pattern without atypia, necrosis, increased cellularity, or diffuse growth pattern (Figure, B and C).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is esthesioneuroblastoma. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. It is typically diagnosed in adults between the ages of 40 and 60, with a slight male predominance. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. Esthesioneuroblastoma can spread to the lymph nodes, brain, and bones. Treatment typically involves surgery followed by radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with esthesioneuroblastoma is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of over 80%.

**Answer:**

The answer is A. Esthesioneuroblastoma.

Title: Incidental Thyroid Mass in a Patient With Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Case is: A 71-year-old man with no history of smoking was referred to our tertiary center in August 2018 for an asymptomatic left level 5 neck mass that had been present for 6 months. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated metastatic p16-positive (human papillomavirus [HPV]-related) squamous cell carcinoma. Examination revealed a large left base of tongue mass filling the vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an enhancing mass within the left base of tongue and bilateral cervical adenopathy. The patient was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab, completing treatment without breaks in November 2018. His 3-month posttreatment fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging results demonstrated resolution of the activity at the base of tongue mass and the involved cervical lymph nodes, consistent with complete treatment response.In July 2019, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure, A, B). After multidisciplinary review of the case, the patient was offered salvage left modified radical neck dissection and total thyroidectomy. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis (Figure, C).Fine-needle aspiration of the left thyroid lesion showing sheets and clusters of tumor cells with indistinct cell borders, with immunohistochemical staining positive for p16 (A) and negative for TTF-1 (B) (both panels, original magnification ×20). C, Lesional specimen showing tumor cells arranged in irregular nests and cords invading the thyroid parenchyma; normal thyroid tissue shown by the arrowhead (original magnification ×4).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Papillary thyroid carcinoma , B: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma , C: Thyroid lymphoma , D: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, the presence of a metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma in the left level 5 neck node, and the subsequent development of a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node and avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy on FDG-PET/CT imaging are all consistent with metastatic disease from the patient's oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The finding of a 4-cm mass within the left thyroid lobe on ultrasonography and the presence of p16, CK5, and p40 expression in the tumor cells on immunohistochemical staining are also consistent with metastatic disease from the patient's oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. TTF-1 expression is typically negative in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which further supports the diagnosis of metastatic disease from the patient's oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Answer: B. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma

Title: Postexercise Ankle-Brachial Index Testing Case is: A 61-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presented for evaluation of exertional left calf discomfort. Six months prior to presentation, she developed a dull pain in her left calf while climbing stairs. After climbing 2 flights of stairs, she had to stop and rest for approximately 15 seconds. She reported no pain at rest. The patient’s symptoms worsened and began interfering with her work. On physical examination, her heart rate was 82/min and blood pressure was 140/89 mm Hg. Her lower extremities were warm, with strength for femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses at 2+ bilaterally. She had no history of spinal degenerative disease and did not have lower extremity arterial bruits, wounds, sensory deficits, edema, or hair loss. Results of an exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test are shown in the Table.Diagnose the patient with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and begin medical managementReassure the patient that her pain is nonvascular in originWhat Would You Do Next? A: Diagnose the patient with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and begin medical management , B: Order a lower extremity angiogram , C: Order a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound , D: Reassure the patient that her pain is nonvascular in origin. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is a narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to the legs. It is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, a build-up of plaque in the arteries. PAD can cause symptoms such as exertional leg pain, cramping, and numbness or tingling in the legs.

The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a test that is used to diagnose PAD. It is performed by measuring the blood pressure in the ankle and arm. A normal ABI is greater than 1.0. An ABI of less than 0.9 indicates PAD.

In this case, the patient's ABI is 0.8, which is consistent with PAD. The patient also has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for PAD.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and ABI results, I would diagnose the patient with PAD and begin medical management. Medical management for PAD includes lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, exercise, and weight loss. In some cases, medication may also be necessary.

Answer:
A. Diagnose the patient with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and begin medical management.

Serum CA-125 level was normal; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 18 ng/mL (reference, <5 ng/mL).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a variety of conditions, including:

* Appendiceal neoplasm
* Carcinomatosis
* Diverticulitis
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Mesenteric ischemia
* Ovarian neoplasm
* Pelvic inflammatory disease
* Pyelonephritis

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is appendiceal neoplasm. This is supported by the patient's history of uterine carcinoma, the presence of an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum on imaging, and the nondiagnostic results of paracentesis.

The next step in management is to perform laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.

Title: Shock in an Octogenarian During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Case is: A male allergist in his 80s with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atopic rhinosinusitis developed substernal chest pressure after returning home from duck hunting. The patient noted an elevated blood pressure and took clonidine hydrochloride without effect, so he called emergency medical services. His chest pressure resolved after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin en route to the emergency department. On arrival, his blood pressure was 222/120 mm Hg, which subsequently normalized with administration of his home regimen for hypertension. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a preexisting left bundle-branch block. The troponin I level was initially undetectable but subsequently peaked at 1.3 ng/mL (conversion to micrograms per liter is 1:1). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of ischemia in the area supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory the following day for further management of his non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.Coronary angiography revealed a high-grade distal left main coronary artery (LM) bifurcation lesion extending predominantly into the LAD (Figure 1A); the remainder of his coronary tree showed no evidence of obstructive disease. Given the patient’s low SYNTAX (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] with taxus and cardiac surgery) score and preference to avoid surgery, he underwent transradial PCI of the LM-LAD using a provisional approach for the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). Following initial angioplasty, the patient abruptly became hypotensive without chest discomfort despite quick balloon inflations and robust thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow down both the LAD and LCX. There was no evidence of coronary dissection or perforation. The LM-LAD was quickly stented (Figure 1B) as intravenous fluids and escalating doses of intravenous dopamine hydrochloride and epinephrine drips were administered. Unfortunately, his blood pressure continued to rapidly decline, and he experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and the patient was emergently intubated, but he remained in asystole.Selective left coronary angiography before (A) and after (B) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left main coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery.What Would You Do Next? A: Insert a percutaneous left ventricular assist device , B: Perform pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion , C: Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , D: Perform root and ascending aortography. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient in this case has suffered a cardiac arrest following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is cardiogenic shock, which is a state of profound circulatory collapse caused by acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition, and early treatment is essential to improve the patient's chance of survival.

The first step in treating cardiogenic shock is to restore circulating blood volume. This can be done by administering intravenous fluids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution. In some cases, blood may also need to be transfused. Once circulating blood volume has been restored, the next step is to improve cardiac output. This can be done by administering inotropic agents, such as dobutamine or dopamine. In some cases, an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) may also be used.

The patient in this case has already received intravenous fluids and inotropic agents, but his blood pressure remains low and he is still in asystole. The next step in his management is to initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). VA ECMO is a life-support therapy that provides both cardiac and respiratory support. It is used to bridge the patient to a more definitive treatment, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Title: Lateral Vocal Fold Fullness in a Patient With Heavy Voice Use Case is: A 45-year-old male professional voice user with a history of asthma being treated with inhaled steroids presented with a 1-year history of dysphonia. He reported throat tightness after significant voice use and consistent voice roughness that worsened over several weeks. On examination, he had moderate to severe dysphonia with predominant roughness and strain. Videostroboscopy findings were consistent with fungal laryngitis; a 2-week course of fluconazole was administered. Follow-up videostroboscopy findings demonstrated resolution of the fungal laryngitis but revealed residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold. There was a reduction of lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left. The patient continued to report dysphonia and increased vocal effort. A computed tomography scan with contrast showed no specific abnormalities. A direct laryngoscopy for evaluation and treatment was planned. Intraoperatively, there was a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold (Figure, A). A subtle but similar finding was seen on the right true vocal fold, not causing any mass effect (Figure, B). An incision was made in the mucosa of the ventricle overlying the lesion at its lateral extent, and a mucosal flap was elevated over the lesion. This revealed a cartilaginous lesion, which was removed using an AcuBlade CO2 laser (Lumenis) and cup forceps until the cartilaginous edge was smooth within the paraglottic space (Figure, C and D). The histologic specimen showed fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis (Figure, E and F). At 3-months’ follow-up, the patient reported improvement in his voice with decreased effort and strain, which correlated with improvement in the Voice Handicap Index score and objective assessment by the clinicians.Direct laryngoscopy intraoperative images demonstrating left lesion (A), right lesion (B), submucosal firm, white mass excised with a CO2 laser (C), and postoperative view (D); hematoxylin-eosin stain of the left lateral vocal fold lesion showing fragments of cartilage (arrow indicates a peripheral thin fibroblastic rim with a transition to mature chondrocytes of the fibroelastic cartilage toward the center of the nodule) (E) and cartilage with mild nuclear atypia without mitosis (F).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is chondroma. Chondromas are benign tumors of cartilage that typically occur in the paraglottic space of the larynx. They are most common in adults between the ages of 20 and 40, and they are more common in men than in women. Chondromas can cause a variety of symptoms, including hoarseness, dyspnea, and stridor. The diagnosis of chondroma is made on the basis of clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment of chondroma typically involves surgical excision of the tumor. The prognosis for patients with chondroma is generally good, with most patients experiencing long-term remission after surgery.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 57-year-old African American man who presents with a brown pigmented patch on the left side of the hard palate. The lesion is of unknown duration and is reported by the patient to be asymptomatic, although he does endorse occasional pruritus. An extraoral examination is performed without any abnormal findings. On intraoral soft tissue examination, a brown pigmented patch located predominantly on the hard palate is observed. The lesion has well-defined but irregular borders, measured 2 × 1.2 cm in size, and is nontender to palpation. Findings of the remainder of the intraoral soft tissue examination are within normal limits. An incisional biopsy is performed, and the specimen is sent for microscopic diagnosis.

The histologic examination findings reveal soft tissue covered by benign-appearing stratified squamous epithelium, focally spongiotic and acanthotic. Within the epithelium, numerous benign dendritic melanocytes were identified. The underlying connective tissues were unremarkable.

Based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis). Focal melanotic macules are benign, asymptomatic lesions that are typically found in the oral cavity of older adults. They are characterized by the presence of increased numbers of melanocytes in the epithelium. The melanocytes are typically dendritic in shape and are located within the basal layer of the epithelium. Focal melanotic macules are usually small, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter. They are often brown or black in color, but they may also be blue or purple. Focal melanotic macules are typically asymptomatic, but they may occasionally cause pruritus. The diagnosis of focal melanotic macule is made based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings. Treatment is usually not necessary, but excisional biopsy may be performed if the lesion is concerning for malignancy.

Title: Progressive Trigeminal Hypoesthesia Case is: A 34-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia was limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, he did report biting his lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient had no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall (Figure).A, The lesion (indicated by the arrow) is isointense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast.

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a lesion of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). The MRI findings show a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors of the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor, accounting for approximately 50% of all nerve sheath tumors. Schwannomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. They typically present as a painless mass, and they can cause sensory or motor deficits depending on the nerve that they involve. The treatment for schwannoma is surgical excision.

Title: Carotid Space Masses With Liver and Bone Metastases Case is: A young adult nonsmoker patient with a history of asthma presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver (not shown). Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions (Figure 1B).A, Axial contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) demonstrates large left (black asterisk) and small right (white arrowhead) avidly enhancing bilateral carotid space masses.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic glomus vagale tumors. Glomus vagale tumors are rare, highly vascular neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the paraganglia of the vagus nerve. They are typically located in the carotid body, but can also occur in the jugular bulb, the middle ear, and the skull base. Glomus vagale tumors are often asymptomatic, but can present with symptoms related to mass effect, such as neck pain, cranial nerve palsies, and hearing loss. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, which show a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance of the tumor. Treatment is surgical resection, which is often curative. However, glomus vagale tumors are often locally invasive and can metastasize to the lung, liver, and bone.

The other possible diagnoses are metastatic carotid body tumors, metastatic sarcoma, and lymphoma. Metastatic carotid body tumors are rare, but can occur in patients with a history of metastatic cancer. Metastatic sarcoma is a common cancer that can metastasize to the lung, liver, and bone. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It can also metastasize to the lung, liver, and bone.

**Answer:**

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic glomus vagale tumors. The patient's presentation, imaging findings, and treatment are all consistent with this diagnosis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a young adult nonsmoker with a history of asthma who presents with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that has been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver. Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic sarcoma. Sarcomas are a group of malignant tumors that arise from mesenchymal tissues, which are the tissues that make up muscles, bones, and connective tissues. Sarcomas are relatively rare, accounting for only about 1% of all cancers. However, they can be aggressive and can metastasize to other parts of the body, including the liver, bones, and lungs.

The patient's presentation is consistent with metastatic sarcoma. The patient is a young adult, which is the age group in which sarcomas are most commonly diagnosed. The patient has a history of asthma, which is a risk factor for sarcoma. The patient presents with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck, which is the most common site for sarcomas to metastasize to. The patient also has liver and bone metastases, which are common sites for sarcomas to metastasize to.

The imaging findings are also consistent with metastatic sarcoma. The CT scan shows a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation. This is a typical appearance for a metastatic sarcoma. The PET/MRI scan shows intense radiotracer avidity in the bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions. This is also a typical appearance for metastatic sarcoma.

The patient's diagnosis is further supported by the fact that he has no fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms. These symptoms are more commonly associated with infections or inflammatory conditions, which are not likely in this patient given his age, history, and imaging findings.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is metastatic sarcoma. The patient's presentation, imaging findings, and lack of constitutional symptoms are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Title: Bilateral Central Scotoma in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A 43-year-old man presented as a referral for bilateral central vision loss. His medical history was significant for Crohn disease controlled with monthly injections of ustekinumab (Stelara; Janssen Biotech Inc). Symptoms of fever, headache, and myalgia began 1 week prior following a tick bite. He was prescribed oral doxycycline hyclate for suspected Lyme disease. Owing to persistent fever while receiving oral doxycycline hyclate, he was admitted for intravenous administration of doxycycline hyclate, and the fever resolved. He was found to be anemic (hemoglobin concentration, 6.7 g/dL; normal concentration, 13.5-17.5 g/dL) (to convert hemoglobin concentration to g/L, multiply by 10), requiring transfusion. While hospitalized, he developed acute bilateral central scotoma. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit and brain with and without contrast was unremarkable. Infectious serology test results for Lyme disease, syphilis, malaria, Anaplasma species, Cryptococcus species, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and rickettsia were negative. Rheumatologic serology test results for antinuclear antibodies, including Sjögren anti-Ro and anti-La, anti-DNA, and anti-Smith, were also negative. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing revealed elevated proteinase 3 antibody level. In the setting of anemia, infectious-disease consultants raised concern for babesiosis. Peripheral blood smear and polymerase chain reaction were performed; empirical therapy of azithromycin, 500 mg daily, plus atovaquone, 750 mg twice daily, was initiated. Polymerase chain reaction results for babesiosis later returned as negative.Ocular examination revealed uncorrected distance acuity of 20/50 OD and 20/60 OS.

Title: Severe Vision Loss in a Man With Heavy Tobacco and Alcohol Consumption Case is: A 44-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of gradual vision loss in both eyes. He had a medical history of hypertension, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, for which he took amlodipine, lorazepam, citalopram, and quetiapine. He smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years and had a history of substantial alcohol use, drinking 2 to 3 L of wine per day. Because of excessive alcohol intake, he only ate 1 meal per day. His family history was unremarkable for optic nerve conditions or unexplained blindness.On examination, his visual acuity was 20/400 OU, there was no relative afferent pupillary defect, and his anterior segment examination results were normal. Dilated fundus examination results revealed bilateral optic nerve hyperemia, blurred margins, and subtle telangiectatic vessels on the surface of the optic nerve bilaterally.

**Reasoning:**

The patient presents with a history of gradual vision loss in both eyes, which is concerning for optic neuropathy. The patient's history of heavy tobacco and alcohol use is a risk factor for optic neuropathy. The patient's examination findings are consistent with optic neuropathy, including bilateral optic nerve hyperemia, blurred margins, and subtle telangiectatic vessels on the surface of the optic nerve bilaterally. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish Interactive Testing Algorithm fast visual field testing showed central scotomas in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography results of the macula were normal in both eyes. Neurological examination results revealed otherwise normal cranial nerves, normal sensation in the extremities, normal reflexes, and normal strength.

The differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy includes ischemic optic neuropathy, toxic optic neuropathy, and nutritional optic neuropathy. Ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve, which can be due to a number of factors, including atherosclerosis, hypotension, and vasospasm. Toxic optic neuropathy is caused by exposure to toxins, such as methanol, arsenic, and tobacco smoke. Nutritional optic neuropathy is caused by a deficiency of vitamins B12 and folate.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. This is because nutritional optic neuropathy is a common cause of optic neuropathy in patients with a history of heavy tobacco and alcohol use. If the patient's serum vitamin B12 and folate levels are low, then the patient should be treated with vitamin B12 and folate supplements.

**Answer:**

B. Assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels.

Title: A Patient With Glaucoma With Corneal Edema Case is: A white man in his 60s with open-angle glaucoma presented with a 1-month history of pain and irritation in the right eye. Prior surgeries included cataract surgery in both eyes, selective laser trabeculoplasty in both eyes, trabectome in the right eye (NeoMedix), and mitomycin trabeculectomies in both eyes. On presentation, his visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/200 OS with correction (1 line worse from baseline in the right eye). Pressures were 18 mm Hg OU. Medications included latanoprost in both eyes once daily, dorzolamide-timolol in the right eye twice daily, and brimonidine in the right eye once daily without complications until a few months prior to presentation when netarsudil in both eyes once a day was added for high intraocular pressures of 21 mm Hg OD and 17 mm Hg OS. Netarsudil was used in both eyes after a monocular trial of netarsudil in the right eye, which was judged successful owing to a 9–mm Hg pressure reduction in the right eye relative to the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed conjunctival hyperemia and papillae in both eyes. The right cornea had 1.5 mm of inferonasal microcystoid epithelial edema with neovascularization. Cup-disc ratios were 0.8 OD and 0.9 OS. Dorzolamide in the right eye was discontinued. A few weeks later, the patient returned with worsening pain in the right eye, and visual acuity was 20/500 OD and 20/250 OS. There was diffuse microcystoid epithelial and stromal edema in both eyes, worsening reticular changes in the right eye (Figure 1), a new inferocentral wavelike superficial opacification in the left eye, and high pressures (28 mm Hg OD and 13 mm Hg OS).A, Netarsudil-associated reticular epithelial edema was most marked inferior nasally in the right eye (white arrowhead), although diffuse microcystoid epithelial and stromal edema were present in both eyes. B, Anterior segment spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (RTVue; Optovue) of the corresponding inferior nasal cornea in the right eye (white arrowhead).What Would You Do Next? A: Stop timolol in the right eye , B: Stop latanoprost in both eyes , C: Stop netarsudil in both eyes , D: Resume dorzolamide in the right eye. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is C: Stop netarsudil in both eyes.

The patient is presenting with worsening corneal edema after starting netarsudil. This is a known side effect of netarsudil, and it is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the best course of action is to stop netarsudil.

Other possible causes of the patient's symptoms include infection, inflammation, and drug interactions. However, these are less likely than netarsudil being the cause.

Dorzolamide and timolol are both glaucoma medications that can be used to lower intraocular pressure. However, they are not known to cause corneal edema. Therefore, there is no need to stop them.

Latanoprost is a glaucoma medication that is also known to cause corneal edema. However, it is less likely to cause corneal edema than netarsudil. Therefore, there is no need to stop latanoprost at this time.

If the patient's symptoms improve after stopping netarsudil, then it can be concluded that netarsudil was the cause of the corneal edema. In this case, the patient can be started on a different glaucoma medication.

If the patient's symptoms do not improve after stopping netarsudil, then other possible causes of the corneal edema should be investigated.

Title: Digit Ulcerations in a Young Woman Case is: A previously healthy 23-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips of both hands. On review of systems, she reported hair loss, dryness of the eyes and mouth, and mild esophageal dysphagia. She reported no oral ulcers, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, decreased urine output, hematuria, joint pain, fevers, or weight change.On examination, she was afebrile. Heart rate was 60/min; blood pressure, 100/70 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18/min; and Spo2, 100%. Her hands and fingers were mildly edematous, and the fingertips variably showed purple discoloration, distal pitting scars, and ischemic ulcers (Figure, panel A). There was periungual erythema with dilated nailfold capillaries but no splinter hemorrhages. She had no evidence of sclerodactyly or proximal skin thickening, with hands and face showing fine wrinkles and normal-appearing skin folds. Results of initial laboratory studies were notable for white blood cell count 3270/μL; hemoglobin level, 14.5 g/dL; platelet count, 143 ×103/μL; creatinine level, 1.0 mg/dL (88.4 μmol/L); and C-reactive protein level, 0.1 mg/dL. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the bilateral upper extremities showed normal vasculature. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive at 1:640 or greater by indirect immunofluorescence in a composite nuclear and nucleolar fine speckled staining pattern (Figure, B). Subserologic testing showed high positive anti-Ro52 (176; <20), anti-Ro60 (563; <20), and anti–Scl-70 antibodies (786; <20).A, Digital changes observed in patient. B, Antinuclear antibody staining pattern by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 (human epithelial type 2) cells (original magnification ×20).What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with systemic sclerosis, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The most common initial symptoms are Raynaud's phenomenon (vasospasm of the fingers and toes), skin thickening, and joint pain. Other symptoms may include esophageal dysmotility, pulmonary fibrosis, and kidney disease.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with systemic sclerosis. The periungual erythema and dilated nailfold capillaries are characteristic of Raynaud's phenomenon. The distal pitting scars and ischemic ulcers are consistent with digital ischemia. The lack of sclerodactyly or proximal skin thickening suggests that the disease is in its early stages.

The laboratory findings are also consistent with systemic sclerosis. The elevated white blood cell count may be a nonspecific finding, but it could also be a sign of infection. The normal creatinine level and C-reactive protein level suggest that there is no active inflammation. The positive ANA is a serologic marker for systemic sclerosis. The high titers of anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, and anti–Scl-70 antibodies are specific for systemic sclerosis.

The CTA of the bilateral upper extremities showed normal vasculature. This finding is reassuring, as it suggests that the patient does not have a thromboembolic disorder.

The patient's presentation and laboratory findings are most consistent with systemic sclerosis. The next step in management is to start treatment with intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone. This treatment will help to suppress the immune system and prevent further damage to the skin and internal organs.

Her neurological examination showed symmetric 4/5 strength and decreased reflexes in her lower extremities. Sensation to light touch and proprioception were diminished below the knee. Two punch biopsies were performed for histologic review.

The histopathologic findings were consistent with plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis. There was granulomatous inflammation throughout the dermis with mild hyperparakeratosis around a hair follicle. Well-formed, epithelioid granulomas were also present.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. The most common sites of involvement are the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin. Sarcoidosis can occur at any age, but it is most common in people aged 20 to 40 years. Women are affected more often than men.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The chest x-ray is often abnormal, showing hilar lymphadenopathy or pulmonary infiltrates. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is often elevated in sarcoidosis. Gallium-67 scanning can be used to identify areas of active disease.

The treatment of sarcoidosis is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. Other medications, such as methotrexate and azathioprine, may be used in patients who do not respond to corticosteroids.

The prognosis of sarcoidosis is generally good. Most patients with sarcoidosis experience spontaneous remission within 2 to 3 years. However, a small number of patients may have progressive disease that requires lifelong treatment.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 60s with a 1-year history of a pruritic, dark red plaque on his right upper eyelid. The plaque is erythematous, violaceous, indurated, scaly, and has some papules. Histopathologic analysis reveals perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates around cystically dilated follicular infundibula and exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, with admixed plasma cells, eosinophils, and multinucleate giant cells. Alcian blue staining shows focal mild follicular mucin deposition. Immunohistochemical analysis shows lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells within hair follicles was greater than 7:1. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement was demonstrated.

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FLOF). FLOF is a rare variant of mycosis fungoides that presents as a single, localized lesion on the skin. It is characterized by a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium. Alcian blue staining may show focal mild follicular mucin deposition. Immunohistochemical analysis shows lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells within hair follicles is greater than 7:1. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement is often demonstrated.

The differential diagnosis for FLOF includes discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), facial papules in frontal fibrosing alopecia (FP-FFA), and Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate. DLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. It is characterized by erythematous, scaly plaques with follicular plugging. FP-FFA is a rare autoimmune disease that causes hair loss in the frontal scalp. It is characterized by erythematous, scaly plaques with follicular plugging and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates. Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate is a benign, self-limited lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin. It is characterized by erythematous, scaly papules and plaques.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination findings, and histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of FLOF. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's presentation.

She presented with a 3-month history of gradual vision loss and a 1-month history of confusion and difficulty with word finding. She had been diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive right breast cancer 8 years prior and underwent lumpectomy and treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with remission since. Five years later, she subsequently developed left inguinal adenopathy, which biopsy results showed was follicular lymphoma. At that time, she was treated with a course of bendamustine and rituximab with subsequent maintenance treatment with rituximab for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, demonstrating T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. This is supported by the patient's history of follicular lymphoma, her recent treatment with rituximab, and the MRI findings of T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement. CNS lymphoma is a rare but serious complication of treatment with rituximab. It is thought to be caused by a reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection in the CNS. The diagnosis of CNS lymphoma is confirmed by biopsy. Treatment options for CNS lymphoma include high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.

Title: An Unusual Electrocardiogram Following Pacemaker Implantation Case is: A man in his 30s was incidentally found to have an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) result. Two years prior to presentation, the patient was presumptively diagnosed with viral myocarditis at an outside hospital after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was subsequently scheduled to undergo endomyocardial biopsy but was lost to follow-up. Two weeks prior to the date of the presenting ECG, he was admitted to the hospital for symptomatic bradycardia and found to be in sinus rhythm with complete atrioventricular block. A dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, with active fixation leads placed in the right atrium and right ventricular apex. An ECG obtained immediately after the procedure showed an atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. The postimplantation course was uncomplicated, and he was subsequently discharged. He presented for routine postprocedure outpatient follow-up, at which time this ECG (Figure 1) was obtained. His vital signs were documented as a blood pressure of 119/69 mm Hg, a heart rate of 51 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. He was asymptomatic.What Would You Do Next? A: Place a transvenous pacing device , B: Begin transcutaneous pacing , C: Obtain chest radiographs , D: Place a magnet on the pulse generator. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a dual-chamber pacemaker that is in atrial-ventricular–paced rhythm. The ECG shows a sinus rhythm with complete atrioventricular block. This indicates that the pacemaker is not pacing the ventricle. The patient is asymptomatic, so there is no need to place a transvenous pacing device or begin transcutaneous pacing. Chest radiographs are not necessary to diagnose this problem. Placing a magnet on the pulse generator will disable the pacemaker and allow the patient's own heart rhythm to take over. This is the best option because it will allow the patient's heart to function normally while the problem with the pacemaker is being addressed.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 30s with a history of treatment-naive HIV (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) and untreated syphilis. He presents with 3 weeks of progressively worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor. On arrival to the hospital, he has a computed tomography scan performed; results demonstrate an obstructive laryngeal mass but no signs of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. He is taken urgently to the operating room where an awake tracheostomy is performed without complication. Findings of a direct laryngoscopy demonstrate violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue as well as a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway. Full physical examination findings also demonstrate violaceous nodules involving the patient’s lower extremities. Results of an excisional biopsy demonstrate a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for human herpesvirus-8.

The differential diagnosis for an obstructive laryngeal mass in an HIV-positive patient includes Kaposi sarcoma, syphilitic gumma of the larynx, bacillary angiomatosis, and angiosarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. It is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in HIV-positive patients. Syphilitic gumma is a granulomatous lesion caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is a rare manifestation of syphilis, but it can occur in patients with advanced disease. Bacillary angiomatosis is a pyogenic infection caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. It is a common infection in HIV-positive patients, and it can present as a multifocal vascular lesion. Angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of blood vessels. It is more common in older adults, but it has been reported in HIV-positive patients.

In this case, the patient has a history of treatment-naive HIV and untreated syphilis. He also has violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue and a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they demonstrate a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for HHV-8.

Title: Slow-Growing Painless Parotid Nodule in a Woman in Her 40s Case is: A 44-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic enlarging right parotid mass of about 6 years’ duration. She had no prior medical or surgical history and took no medications. Ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and hypoechoic mass, 1.5 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, in the inferior right parotid gland with minimal vascularity and without extraparotid extension. No lymph node abnormality was observed. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and the smear was extremely cellular and showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. Because of the size and location, extracapsular dissection II was carried out.1 The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture (Figure, A and B). Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for periodic acid–Schiff (Figure, C). Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 6-year history of an enlarging right parotid mass. The mass is solid and hypoechoic on ultrasound, with minimal vascularity and no extraparotid extension. Fine-needle aspiration shows sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. The final pathology shows a salivary gland carcinoma with microcystic and papillary architecture. Abundant bubbly secretion is present within these microcystic spaces, and this material is positive for periodic acid–Schiff. Immunohistochemically, there is positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15. Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 and p63 are negative. The tumor appears to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There is perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV and a level II superselective neck dissection.

The most likely diagnosis is secretory carcinoma. Secretory carcinoma is a rare subtype of salivary gland carcinoma that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the parotid gland. The tumor is composed of cells that produce a bubbly secretion, which is evident on histology and immunohistochemical staining. Secretory carcinoma is typically low-grade and has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment.

The other possible diagnoses are acinic cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Acinic cell carcinoma is a common subtype of salivary gland carcinoma that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the parotid gland. The tumor is composed of cells that resemble acinar cells, which are the cells that produce saliva. Acinic cell carcinoma can be low-grade or high-grade, and the prognosis depends on the grade of the tumor. Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified is a diagnosis given to salivary gland carcinomas that do not fit into any of the other specific subtypes. These tumors are typically high-grade and have a poor prognosis. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare subtype of salivary gland carcinoma that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the parotid gland. The tumor is composed of a mixture of cells that resemble mucous cells, epidermoid cells, and glandular cells. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment.

In this case, the patient's tumor is most consistent with secretory carcinoma. The tumor is composed of cells that produce a bubbly secretion, which is evident on histology and immunohistochemical staining. The tumor is also low-grade and has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment.

Title: Visual Acuity Loss in a Healthy Man Case is: A healthy man in his 60s presented with a 4-month history of blurred vision in his left eye. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal in each eye. Anterior segment and fundus examination results were normal in the right eye. In the left eye, the media were clear, and there were multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of the normal choroidal vasculature throughout the entire fundus (Figure 1A). There was no sign of vitritis or retinitis and no history of previous trauma, uveitis, sarcoidosis, or cancer. Ocular ultrasonography revealed diffuse ciliochoroidal thickening measuring 2.9 mm in elevation. Optical coherence tomography disclosed generalized, undulating choroidal infiltration in a seasick pattern, so to speak, given its resemblance to a stormy ocean surface, with overlying draping of the retina in the foveal region (Figure 1B).A, A healthy man in his 60s with decreased visual acuity in the left eye was found to have multiple patchy, yellow choroidal foci with loss of the choroidal vascular detail throughout the entire fundus.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The most common type of NHL that affects the eye is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is a rapidly growing cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, bones, and lungs.

The patient's history of blurred vision in his left eye for 4 months is concerning for a mass lesion in the eye. The presence of multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of the normal choroidal vasculature throughout the entire fundus is also consistent with a diagnosis of DLBCL. The patient's ocular ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of DLBCL.

The patient's history of no previous trauma, uveitis, sarcoidosis, or cancer is reassuring, as these conditions can also cause choroidal lesions. However, the patient's lack of a history of these conditions does not rule out a diagnosis of DLBCL.

The patient's relook at the anterior segment in the left eye revealed a faint conjunctival thickening at the limbus suggestive of lymphoid tumor. Incisional biopsy of the epibulbar lesion revealed sheetlike infiltration of small monomorphic lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and Dutcher bodies. These findings are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of DLBCL.

The patient's serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy results are not yet available. However, the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of DLBCL.

Given the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the most appropriate next step in management is to begin systemic intravenous rituximab. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets B cells. It is a first-line treatment for DLBCL.

The anterior segment examination, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits.

The most likely diagnosis is herpes zoster ophthalmicus. This is a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. VZV can remain latent in the sensory ganglia after chickenpox infection and reactivate years later, causing a painful rash with blisters on the skin innervated by the affected ganglion. The most common site of involvement is the face, including the eyelid.

The treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. These medications can help to reduce the severity of the rash and the risk of complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is a chronic pain syndrome that can develop after herpes zoster infection. It is estimated to occur in up to 20% of patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

In addition to antiviral medications, patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus should also be treated with topical steroids to reduce inflammation and prevent scarring. In some cases, surgical debridement of the lesion may be necessary.

In the case of this patient, the most appropriate next step is to start him on antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir. He should also be started on topical steroids. If the lesion does not improve with these measures, surgical debridement may be necessary.

Title: Middle-aged Woman With Optic Neuritis and a Rapidly Progressing Retinal Vaso-occlusive Disease Case is: A woman in her 40s presented to an outside ophthalmologist with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in her right eye. Her Snellen visual acuities were 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. The right eye had a relative afferent pupillary defect and mild optic nerve edema. To rule out optic neuritis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain and orbits was obtained; the results were unremarkable. Six days after symptom onset, her visual acuity decreased to 20/70 OD and the disc edema increased. In addition, the right eye had developed 2+ anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion. At this time the patient was referred to our clinic. On presentation 1 day later, visual acuity was light perception OD and still 20/20 OS. The right eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell, inferior keratic precipitates, and 1+ vitreous cell. The right optic nerve had grade 4 disc edema with flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. The fundus examination results of the right eye revealed the following superior quadrant retinal findings: extensive intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages along vessels, arteriolar attenuation and sheathing, venous engorgement, and tortuosity. The inferior midperiphery had numerous small areas of deep retinal whitening (Figure 1). Examination results of the left eye were normal.An Optos color photograph of the right eye of a woman in her 40s with grade 4 disc edema and associated flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages. Also noted are diffuse intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages in the superior peripheral retina. The retinal arteries are attenuated with box carring throughout the retina. There is extensive vascular sheathing involving predominantly the retinal venules, which are also dilated and tortuous (arrowhead).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 40s with a 3-day history of an inferior scotoma in her right eye. She has rapidly progressive visual loss, with visual acuity decreasing from 20/25 to light perception in the right eye over a period of 6 days. The patient also has optic nerve edema, anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and a possible branch vein occlusion in the right eye.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes optic neuritis, retinal vein occlusion, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Optic neuritis is a demyelinating disease of the optic nerve that is most commonly associated with multiple sclerosis. Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of a retinal vein that can lead to ischemia and infarction of the retina. Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a condition that occurs when there is a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve, which can lead to optic nerve edema and visual loss.

The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of optic neuritis. The optic nerve edema, anterior chamber cell, and keratic precipitates are all consistent with an inflammatory process. The possible branch vein occlusion could be secondary to the optic neuritis, or it could be a separate process.

The patient should be treated with systemic corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and promote visual recovery. Intraocular corticosteroid injections can also be used, but they are not as effective as systemic corticosteroids. The patient should also be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment of her multiple sclerosis.

Title: A Young Man With Peripheral Vision Loss Case is: A man in his 30s with an unremarkable medical and ocular history presented to his optometrist with reduced peripheral vision. The patient reported slowly progressive difficulty with night driving as well as perceiving objects in the periphery over the past 5 years. The patient was an avid basketball player and was forced to quit recently when he was unable to locate his teammates during play. He denied changes in color vision. There was no history of trauma. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. His parents and both siblings were reportedly healthy with no history of ocular disease. His visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with no afferent pupillary defect. The Farnsworth D-15 dichotomous test results were normal in the right eye and tritan deficient in the left eye. His intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Refraction revealed hyperopic astigmatism in both eyes. His anterior examination results were unremarkable with no evidence of intraocular inflammation. The dilated fundus examination results showed minimal optic nerve pallor, vascular attenuation in both eyes, and a subtle area of increased pigmentation in the superior retina of the right eye only (Figure 1A). The fundus autofluorescence results showed bilateral peripheral mottled hypoautofluorescence contrasting a ring of hyperautofluorescence around the macula (Figure 1B). Automated perimetry was reliable and showed symmetrical severe bilateral field constriction with a remaining island of 6° of central vision.Right eye.

The patient is a young man with progressive peripheral vision loss. The history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP is a group of inherited retinal diseases that cause progressive degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. This results in loss of peripheral vision, which can eventually lead to blindness.

There is no cure for RP, but there are treatments that can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve quality of life. These treatments include low-vision aids, such as telescopes and magnifiers, and mobility training.

The next step in the management of this patient would be to obtain a full-field electroretinogram (ERG). An ERG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. This test can help to confirm the diagnosis of RP and to assess the severity of the disease.

Other tests that may be helpful in the diagnosis of RP include fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and visual field testing. Fundus autofluorescence is a test that uses a special camera to detect abnormal areas of the retina. OCT is a test that uses sound waves to create a detailed image of the retina. Visual field testing is a test that measures the patient's ability to see objects in the periphery.

Once the diagnosis of RP has been confirmed, the patient should be referred to a retinal specialist for further management. The retinal specialist will discuss the risks and benefits of the available treatments and will help the patient to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to their individual needs.

A full-field ERG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. This test can help to confirm the diagnosis of RP and to assess the severity of the disease.

Title: A Case of an Iris Cyst Not to Be Missed Case is: A man in his 30s presented for assessment of long-standing iris lesions in both eyes. He was unaware of any recent changes in the size or number of these lesions. His visual acuity measured 20/25 (6/7.5) OU, and his intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. The patient had noticed progressive visual obscuration in his left eye. He was not taking any ocular medications, and his only systemic medication was an oral β-blocker. He was otherwise healthy, and his family history was noncontributory.On a slitlamp examination, multiple brown masses were noted at the pupillary margin in both eyes, encroaching on the central visual axis (Figure). There was no inflammation in the anterior chamber or vitreous. The findings of the posterior pole examination were unremarkable bilaterally.Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvisWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient presented with multiple brown masses at the pupillary margin in both eyes, encroaching on the central visual axis. These findings are consistent with iris cysts. Iris cysts are usually benign, but they can cause visual problems if they grow large enough to block the pupil. In this case, the patient had also noticed progressive visual obscuration in his left eye. This suggests that the cysts in his left eye may be causing significant visual impairment.

To further evaluate the patient and determine the best course of treatment, I would order a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This scan would help to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that could be causing the iris cysts, such as a tumor or an infection. It would also help to assess the size and location of the cysts, which would be important in planning any surgical treatment.

Title: Chest Pain and a Cavitary Lung Mass in a Woman With Diabetes Case is: A 55-year-old woman from the Southeastern US with a history of smoking, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c level, 15.5%), and chronic pain from osteoarthritis treated with inhalational medical marijuana presented with 4 months of productive cough, 22.7-kg (50-lb) weight loss, subjective fevers, and 3 days of worsening chest pain.Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a large right upper lobe cavitary mass. She was treated empirically with intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy was performed. Lung tissue was sent for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Nocardia cultures and for histopathology. BAL cultures grew 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of group B streptococci and 1 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger. Results of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing were negative. Voriconazole was added to her treatment. Transbronchial biopsy histopathology showed acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue and necrosis, and negative fungal and AFB stains.Two weeks later, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain provoked by palpation, right arm movement, and deep inspiration. Repeat chest CT demonstrated cavitary mass enlargement with possible pleural invasion (Figure 1, left). She developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement, which yielded charcoal-colored pleural fluid (Figure 1, right).Left, Computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrating large right upper lobe cavitary lesion, layering debris, and bronchial wall thickening. Right, Charcoal-black appearance of the pleural fluid seen in the atrium of the patient’s right-side chest tube placed for tension pneumothorax.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a cavitary lung mass that is expanding and invading the pleura. She has also developed a right-sided tension pneumothorax. These findings suggest that the patient has aspergillosis, a fungal infection that can be life-threatening. Treatment for aspergillosis typically involves a combination of antifungal medications and surgery to remove the infected lung tissue.

Answer: D. Perform right upper lobe resection.

The patient's condition is rapidly deteriorating and she requires immediate surgical intervention to remove the infected lung tissue. Radiation therapy and antimicrobial therapy may be used in addition to surgery, but they are not sufficient on their own to treat this infection.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a white woman in her early 40s with a 10-year history of generalized pruritus. She has no other medical history. The skin biopsy report 2 years before presentation indicated spongiotic dermatitis. She has been treated with topical corticosteroids with no control of the symptoms. Physical examination reveals erythematous papules, some of them crusted, and some excoriations located over the trunk and upper extremities. In addition, some scales and fissures are seen on her lower lip, sparing the surrounding skin, as well as inner mouth and upper lip. A new biopsy sample was taken to rule out actinic cheilitis.

The most likely diagnosis is actinic prurigo cheilitis. Actinic prurigo cheilitis is a chronic, pruritic skin condition that is characterized by the development of erythematous papules, some of which may be crusted, on the lower lip. The condition is typically seen in older adults, and it is thought to be caused by chronic sun exposure. The treatment for actinic prurigo cheilitis is topical corticosteroids, and in some cases, oral steroids may also be necessary.

The other possible diagnoses are herpes simplex virus–associated pseudolymphoma, cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, and marginal zone lymphoma. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Title: Cardiac Masses in a Patient With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma and a History of Breast Carcinoma Case is: A 64-year-old woman with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and a history of hormone receptor–positive left-sided breast cancer (treated with lumpectomy and radiation in 2014) was transferred to our hospital for management of a displaced percutaneous hepatobiliary drain. She was diagnosed as having pancreatic adenocarcinoma in September 2019 after developing right upper quadrant pain and jaundice, which prompted imaging and a subsequent endoscopic biopsy of a pancreatic head mass. She established oncologic care in Kentucky and received 1 dose of gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)–paclitaxel in early October 2019. Her posttreatment course was complicated by elevated levels of transaminases, significant fatigue, and an infusion port thrombosis. Her infusion port (right sided) was subsequently removed, and she was given 1.5 mg/kg of enoxaparin daily for anticoagulation.After her transfer, the oncology department was consulted regarding treatment options for her pancreatic cancer. Several hypodense lesions in the apex of her heart were appreciated on review of her previous chest computed tomography scan (Figure 1A). A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 1B) was obtained and revealed several discrete, partially mobile frondlike masses originating from her cardiac apex. The cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery departments were consulted for input pertaining to her case. Both services requested cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for further clarification of her imaging findings.A, An axial slice from the patient’s chest computed tomography with contrast.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of hormone receptor–positive left-sided breast cancer (treated with lumpectomy and radiation in 2014) who was diagnosed with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma in September 2019. She received 1 dose of gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)–paclitaxel in early October 2019. Her posttreatment course was complicated by elevated levels of transaminases, significant fatigue, and an infusion port thrombosis. Her infusion port (right sided) was subsequently removed, and she was given 1.5 mg/kg of enoxaparin daily for anticoagulation.

On review of her previous chest computed tomography scan, several hypodense lesions were appreciated in the apex of her heart. A subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed several discrete, partially mobile frondlike masses originating from her cardiac apex. The cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery departments were consulted for input pertaining to her case. Both services requested cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for further clarification of her imaging findings.

The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple, lobulated masses in the apex of the left ventricle, with a maximum size of 2.5 cm. The masses were hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or lymphadenopathy.

The differential diagnosis for cardiac masses includes primary cardiac tumors, metastatic tumors, and thrombi. Primary cardiac tumors are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all cardiac tumors. The most common primary cardiac tumor is myxoma, which is a benign tumor that typically arises from the left atrium. Other primary cardiac tumors include papillary fibroelastoma, fibroma, and sarcoma.

Metastatic tumors to the heart are more common than primary cardiac tumors. The most common tumors that metastasize to the heart are breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. Other tumors that can metastasize to the heart include renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, and prostate cancer.

Apical left ventricular thrombi are the most common type of cardiac thrombus. They typically occur in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions that predispose to thrombus formation, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

In the patient described above, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the presence of multiple, lobulated masses in the apex of the left ventricle, and the lack of evidence of primary cardiac tumors, thrombi, or other causes of cardiac masses.

Title: A 32-Year-Old Man With Chronic Left Ventricular Dysfunction Case is: A 32-year-old man with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy sought care for angina and dyspnea with exertion. His chest pain and dyspnea were chronic and had recently increased in frequency. His cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years, at which time the ejection fraction was reported to be 30%. The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable.On examination, he was afebrile. His heart rate was 68 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 114/77 mm Hg, and his examination was notable for an absence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, and murmurs or extra heart sounds. His electrocardiogram, shown in Figure 1, was notable for right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from his electrocardiogram at age 14 years. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. His ejection fraction was estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed.Percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending arteryWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 32-year-old man with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. He presents with angina and dyspnea with exertion. His cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years. The results of a graded exercise stress test at 22 years were unremarkable.

On examination, he is afebrile and has a heart rate of 68 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 114/77 mm Hg, and no jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, murmurs, or extra heart sounds.

His ejection fraction is estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed.

The left anterior descending artery (LAD) is severely narrowed. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the LAD would be the most appropriate next step in management. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon into the narrowed artery and inflating it to widen the artery. This procedure can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve symptoms.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 80s with a history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer in remission. He presents with 3 months of painless progressive vision loss, followed by gait changes, memory loss, and 10-lb unintentional weight loss. On ophthalmic examination, he has hand motion visual acuity in both eyes, with a briskly reactive left pupil and trace right relative afferent pupillary defect. He can detect 2/4 gross colors in the right eye and 1/4 gross colors in the left eye. Confrontation visual fields reveal dense right homonymous hemianopia with additional asymmetric deficits on Goldmann perimetry. Extraocular movements are full with gaze-evoked nystagmus. Horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex, assessed by head impulse testing, is normal.

Syphilis screen was negative. Serum thiamine, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid composition, infectious studies, cytology, flow cytometry, and paraneoplastic panel showed only mildly elevated protein.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes stroke, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, glaucoma, and malingering. Stroke is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's age, history of coronary artery disease, and acute onset of vision loss. However, the absence of any focal neurologic deficits on examination and the unremarkable neuroimaging studies make this diagnosis less likely. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility, given the patient's age and history of autoimmune disease. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms typical of multiple sclerosis, such as paresthesias, weakness, or bladder dysfunction. Optic neuritis is a less likely diagnosis, given the patient's age and the absence of any pain with vision loss. Glaucoma is also a less likely diagnosis, given the patient's age and the absence of any optic nerve cupping on fundus examination. Malingering is a possibility, given the patient's history of psychiatric illness. However, the patient's presentation is otherwise consistent with a neurological disorder, and there is no evidence to suggest that he is malingering.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel. This test is used to screen for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare but fatal neurodegenerative disorder. The patient's presentation is consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, including his age, history of coronary artery disease, and acute onset of vision loss. The absence of any focal neurologic deficits on examination and the unremarkable neuroimaging studies make other diagnoses less likely. If the cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel is positive, the patient will need to be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and management.

The most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in tissues and organs. Amyloidosis can affect any organ in the body, but the most common sites of involvement are the kidneys, heart, liver, and nerves.

The treatment of amyloidosis depends on the type of amyloidosis and the organs involved. There is no cure for amyloidosis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

In this case, the patient has primary localized amyloidosis, which is a rare form of amyloidosis that affects the skin and conjunctiva. The treatment for primary localized amyloidosis is surgical excision of the affected tissue.

Title: Rapidly Progressive Bilateral Visual Acuity Loss in a Middle-Aged Woman Case is: A 46-year-old healthy Hispanic woman presented with 2 days of photophobia in her right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/30 + 2 OD and 20/20 OS. Her intraocular pressure, extraocular motility, and pupillary light reactions were normal. An examination demonstrated trace anterior cells in the right eye; otherwise, the examination had normal results. No vitreous cells were present. Topical prednisolone was started for presumed acute anterior uveitis.One week later, the photophobia had improved. However, unnoticed by the patient, her BCVA had worsened to 20/200 OD and 20/40 OS. An examination demonstrated new subretinal fluid in the macula in the right eye (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography showed peripapillary speckled pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence in the right eye. Indocyanine green showed early choroidal vessel hyperfluorescence and several posterior focal hypofluorescent spots in the midphase in both eyes. Autofluorescence showed patchy hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. Tuberculosis and syphilis testing had negative results. A complete blood cell count was unremarkable. A diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR) was made. The topical prednisolone was stopped.Findings on presentation and follow-up. A, Optical coherence tomography of the right eye demonstrates posterior vitreous cells (white arrowheads), subretinal fluid, and choroidal corrugation (yellow arrowheads). B, Fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates multifocal, demarcated exudative retinal detachments, including in the macula. Similar findings were present in the left eye.One week later, the BCVA worsened to E at 3 feet OD and 20/200 OS. An examination now revealed 2+ vitreous cells and extensive exudative retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure 1B). No retinal tears were seen on a depressed examination.Retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckleWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient has a history of central serous retinopathy (CSR) in both eyes. CSR is a common condition that affects the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for central vision. It is characterized by the accumulation of subretinal fluid, which can cause blurred vision and metamorphopsia (distortion of vision). In most cases, CSR resolves spontaneously within a few months. However, in some cases, the subretinal fluid can persist or recur, which can lead to permanent vision loss.

In the patient's case, her CSR has progressed to retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is a serious condition in which the retina separates from the underlying choroid. If left untreated, retinal detachment can lead to permanent blindness.

The treatment for retinal detachment depends on the cause and the extent of the detachment. In the patient's case, her retinal detachment is caused by CSR. The treatment for CSR is usually observation or laser therapy. However, in the patient's case, her CSR has progressed to retinal detachment, which requires surgery.

The most common surgical treatment for retinal detachment is vitrectomy. Vitrectomy is a procedure in which the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye, is removed. The vitreous humor is then replaced with a gas bubble or silicone oil. The gas bubble or silicone oil helps to push the retina back into place.

In some cases, a scleral buckle may also be necessary. A scleral buckle is a surgical procedure in which a band of silicone is sutured to the sclera, the white of the eye. The scleral buckle helps to support the retina and prevent it from detaching again.

Title: A Solitary Scaly Plaque on the Lower Extremity of a Young Girl Case is: A preschool-age girl presented for evaluation of an asymptomatic plaque on the right lower extremity that had been present for 1 year. Prior treatments included triamcinolone ointment and frankincense with no improvement. A potassium hydroxide preparation had negative results for fungal elements. Her medical history and family history were unremarkable. An examination found a 1-cm nummular plaque with centralized micaceous scale and a smooth erythematous border on the right lateral lower leg (Figure, A). A tangential-shave biopsy was performed to characterize the lesion. Histopathological testing revealed an epidermis featuring elongated rete ridges, keratinocyte enlargement, and a few Civatte bodies, with overlying parakeratotic crust and neutrophilic cell debris. Marked epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and halos, both singly and in small collections (Pautrier microabscesses) were also observed (Figure, B and C). Also, lymphocytes were present along the epidermal side of the dermoepidermal junction. Periodic acid–Schiff stained sections failed to show fungal or yeast elements. Immunohistochemical staining was markedly positive for CD3, CD5, and CD8 (Figure, D); CD4 reactivity was less robust and mainly restricted to dermal lymphocytes.

Based on the history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with a solitary or few well-defined patches or plaques on the skin. The lesions are often scaly and erythematous, and they may have a velvety or verrucous surface. Mycosis fungoides is a chronic disease that can progress to more advanced stages, including generalized erythroderma, poikiloderma atrophicans faciei, and lymphomatoid papulosis.

The differential diagnosis for mycosis fungoides includes other cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, such as Sézary syndrome and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. It is important to distinguish mycosis fungoides from other skin diseases, such as psoriasis, eczema, and contact dermatitis.

The treatment of mycosis fungoides depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may be used. In more advanced disease, systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.

A punch biopsy was obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is linear atrophoderma of Moulin. This is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by linear streaks of atrophic skin. It typically occurs in children and young adults, and is more common in females. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be a developmental abnormality. The condition is usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes be associated with itching or pain. There is no cure, but the condition usually improves with time.

Other possible diagnoses include epidermal nevus, lichen striatus, and segmental incontinentia pigmenti. Epidermal nevus is a congenital skin condition characterized by a patch of abnormal skin. It can be present at birth or develop in early childhood. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a mutation in a gene. The condition is usually benign, but can sometimes be associated with other medical problems. Lichen striatus is a rare, inflammatory skin condition that typically affects children. It is characterized by a linear band of scaly skin. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. The condition usually resolves on its own within a few years. Segmental incontinentia pigmenti is a rare, genetic disorder that affects the skin, hair, and teeth. It is characterized by streaks of abnormal skin pigmentation. The condition is caused by a mutation in a gene. There is no cure, but the condition can be treated with medication and surgery.

Title: Facial Erythema in an Elderly Man Case is: A man in his 80s with a pacemaker; a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, and Parkinson disease; and dependence in all activities of daily living presented to the dermatology department with a 4-month history of new-onset persistent facial eruption. He denied a history of facial flushing. The patient was initially treated for rosacea at an outside hospital with topical 1% metronidazole cream for 1 month without improvement and developed acute facial purpura after 1 day of treatment with oral doxycycline, which was discontinued. Because of the eruption’s rapid onset and violaceous appearance, as well as empirical treatment failure, the patient was referred for further evaluation. On examination, the patient had asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques over a phymatous background (Figure, A). A series of punch biopsies were performed (Figure, B-D).A, Clinical image showing erythemato-violaceous plaques with ecchymotic areas.

Reasoning:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, and Parkinson disease; and dependence in all activities of daily living. He presented to the dermatology department with a 4-month history of new-onset persistent facial eruption. He denied a history of facial flushing. The patient was initially treated for rosacea at an outside hospital with topical 1% metronidazole cream for 1 month without improvement and developed acute facial purpura after 1 day of treatment with oral doxycycline, which was discontinued.

On examination, the patient had asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques over a phymatous background. A series of punch biopsies were performed.

The histopathologic image shows ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis. On higher magnification, ectatic vascular channels were lined by atypical plump endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry was negative for Human herpesvirus 8.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of rosacea-like angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive vascular neoplasm that can occur at any age, but is most common in the elderly. It is often diagnosed late in its course, when it is difficult to treat. The most common presenting symptom is a rapidly growing, painless mass. Other symptoms may include bleeding, ulceration, and pain.

The diagnosis of angiosarcoma is made on the basis of clinical and histopathologic findings. The clinical presentation of angiosarcoma can be variable, and it can be mistaken for other conditions, such as Kaposi sarcoma, pyogenic granuloma, and bacillary angiomatosis. The histopathologic findings of angiosarcoma are also non-specific, and it can be difficult to distinguish from other vascular neoplasms.

The treatment of angiosarcoma is based on the stage of disease. In early-stage disease, surgical resection may be curative. In advanced-stage disease, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or targeted therapy. The prognosis of angiosarcoma is poor, with a median survival of 12 months.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a 3-week history of worsening spasms in her axial and lower limb muscles and new-onset urinary retention. Sudden episodes of painful involuntary spasms first appeared in her abdominal muscles 2 weeks after a cold. Soon after, spasms spread to all of her axial muscles and both lower limbs. These paroxysmal episodes lasted a few seconds, occurred up to 20 times a day, and were exacerbated by external stimuli. There was no impairment of consciousness during the attacks. A review of her previous records revealed a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis 1 month earlier. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.

On admission, the patient was found to be hyperhidrotic and tachypneic. Neurological examination revealed an abnormal mental status, slow saccades, symmetric and severe hypertonia and rigidity throughout her trunk and all 4 extremities, severe spasms, patella clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, marked myoclonus on tactile and acoustic stimulation, and extensor plantar responses bilaterally.

Laboratory results were significant for an elevated level of thyroperoxidase antibodies (50.85 IU/mL; normal, <5.16 IU/mL) and thyroglobulin antibodies (88.35 ng/mL; normal: <4.11 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Cerebrospinal fluid testing results revealed normal protein level and cell counts, as well as absent oligoclonal bands or evidence of infection. Her paraneoplastic panel results were negative. Cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging yielded no abnormalities. Needle electromyography (EMG) results showed a continuous firing of normal motor unit potentials at rest within the axial and lower limb muscles. A routine electroencephalogram (EEG) showed mild background slowing without periodic discharges. Computed tomography scan results of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were negative. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). PERM is a rare, autoimmune disorder that is characterized by progressive rigidity, myoclonus, and encephalopathy. The disease is most often seen in young adults and is more common in women than men. The exact cause of PERM is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder that attacks the central nervous system.

The diagnosis of PERM is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory testing, neuroimaging, and electromyography. There is no cure for PERM, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment typically includes a combination of medications, such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and anticonvulsants.

Title: A 38-Year-Old Woman With Worsening Dyspnea After Giving Birth Case is: A 38-year-old woman without a significant medical history presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. When at full term, a planned vaginal delivery was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, she had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Troponin levels were normal. A vascular ultrasound study ruled out deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts (Figure 1A). She had progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion noted on chest radiography, and an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 800 pg/mL (conversion to ng/L is 1:1). Physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root (Figure 1B and Video). The patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment. The patient was afebrile at that point, and her white blood cell count was within normal limits.A, Non–electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography angiography.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of a complicated vaginal delivery with new onset fever, chest pain, and dyspnea. She has progressive dyspnea, mild pulmonary congestion, an elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level, and a new heart murmur. A non–electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism but was otherwise not diagnostic owing to motion artifacts. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes aortic dissection, infective endocarditis, and acute coronary syndrome. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the heart valves that can also be life-threatening. Acute coronary syndrome is a condition caused by a blockage in one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). TEE is a more sensitive and specific test than TTE for the diagnosis of aortic dissection and infective endocarditis. TEE can also be used to assess the severity of aortic regurgitation and to guide the management of this condition.

Answer: D

The patient should undergo a TEE to further evaluate her aortic regurgitation and to rule out other causes of her symptoms, such as aortic dissection or infective endocarditis.

Title: A Man With Bilateral Corneal Verticillata and Corneal Crystals Case is: A 77-year-old man was referred to the cornea service for bilateral corneal verticillata noted first by his general ophthalmologist. One year prior to presentation, the patient had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was discharged with amiodarone and used the medication for 6 weeks. He did not use amiodarone for the 10 months prior to presentation. Prior to his CABG procedure, the patient only used a low dose of lisinopril until he began experiencing progressive dyspnea and fatigue. He was found to have a 5-vessel blockage once he became symptomatic. His symptoms resolved after the CABG surgery, and he remained otherwise healthy. He denied any other symptoms, including headache, rash, joint pain, or chest pain. His medications at time of presentation were aspirin, atorvastatin, and carvedilol. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. A slitlamp examination revealed bilateral corneal verticillata and numerous fine anterior stromal crystals (Figure). He had mild nuclear sclerosis in both eyes. His pupils were round and equally reactive, and the remainder of the slitlamp examination and dilated fundus examination were within normal limits.Provide reassurance, because the patient is no longer taking amiodaroneWhat Would You Do Next? A: Provide reassurance, because the patient is no longer taking amiodarone , B: Obtain genetic testing , C: Initiate corneal scraping and culture , D: Initiate laboratory testing for immunoglobulins. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

Corneal verticillata is a benign, non-progressive condition that is typically seen in older adults. It is caused by deposition of lipid and pigment in the corneal stroma. The condition is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment.

In this case, the patient has a history of amiodarone use, which is known to cause corneal verticillata. However, the patient has not taken amiodarone for 10 months, and the corneal verticillata is not associated with any other symptoms. Therefore, it is likely that the corneal verticillata is a benign, non-progressive condition that will not require treatment.

Title: Severe Progressive Bilateral Vision Loss With Headaches Case is: An African American woman in her 20s presented to an outside hospital with progressive vision loss in both eyes, photophobia, and nausea, which had developed over weeks. Her home medications were hydrocodone and ibuprofen. Bilateral disc edema was noted on examination, and neuroimaging was obtained. Noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) and CT angiogram were remarkable only for bilateral optic nerve head abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging was concerning for prominent optic nerves (Figure, A). There was no evidence of intracranial masses, hydrocephalus, or bleed. Lumbar puncture revealed cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure of 40 cm of water. Cerebrospinal fluid protein, glucose, IgG, and oligoclonal band levels were within normal limits. Renal function was normal. The patient started receiving oral acetazolamide, 500 mg, twice daily for presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and transferred to our institution.On admission, she was noted to have near-complete vision loss in both eyes, severe postural headaches, and nausea with vomiting. Visual acuity was hand motion OD and no light perception OS. Fundoscopic examination revealed severe papilledema (Frisen grade 4-5 OD; grade 5 OS). A magnetic resonance venography was performed and revealed bilateral filling defect of the transverse sinuses, suggestive of bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST) (Figure, B). The patient continued receiving acetazolamide, 500 mg, twice daily, which was dose escalated to 2000 mg twice daily over 24 hours.Consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placementWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has severe progressive bilateral vision loss with headaches. She has bilateral disc edema on examination, and neuroimaging shows prominent optic nerves. Lumbar puncture reveals cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure of 40 cm of water. These findings are consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Treatment for IIH typically includes acetazolamide, a diuretic that helps to lower cerebrospinal fluid pressure. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid or place a shunt to prevent further vision loss.

In this case, the patient has near-complete vision loss in both eyes and severe headaches. She is also at risk of developing further vision loss if her cerebrospinal fluid pressure is not lowered. Therefore, the best course of action is to consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement.

Title: A Mass in the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid in a Pediatric Patient Case is: A 4-year-old girl with no previous medical or ocular history presented with 10 days of right painless, periorbital swelling and erythema. The patient was previously treated with an oral combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and topical gentamicin therapy without any improvement. The patient’s visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary examination results were within normal limits, and intraocular pressures were 28 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. The extraocular movements and confrontational visual fields were normal. There was right upper and lower eyelid edema with mild erythema and 3 mm of proptosis. The eyelids were nontender to palpation. There was trace vasodilation and chemosis of the conjunctiva in the right eye. The remainder of the slitlamp and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the orbits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits showed a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain (Figure 1).A, Axial computed tomography (CT) of the orbits with contrast shows a large destructive lesion in the right sphenoid bone and anterior aspect of the middle cranial fossa. B, A T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain and orbits without contrast shows the involvement of the right temporal lobe. The lesion can be seen also involving the right side of the sphenoid bone, orbital apex, and scalp anteriorly. The scale across the bottom of each image is measured in centimeters. A indicates anterior; R, right.What Would You Do Next? A: Order a positron emission tomographic scan , B: Start treatment with intravenous antibiotics , C: Start treatment with intravenous corticosteroids , D: Perform biopsy of lesion. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain. The most likely diagnosis is a neoplasm, such as a meningioma or schwannoma. These tumors are typically slow-growing and benign, but they can be locally invasive and cause symptoms such as headache, seizures, and visual impairment.

The next step in management is to obtain a tissue diagnosis to confirm the diagnosis and determine the tumor's grade. This can be done by performing a biopsy of the lesion. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope. This allows the pathologist to determine the type of tumor and its grade.

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment options can be discussed with the patient and their family. Treatment options for neoplasms of the skull base vary depending on the tumor type, grade, and location. In general, treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Title: A Treatment-Refractory, Perianal Tumor Arising in an Otherwise Healthy Older Adult Woman Case is: A woman in her 80s presented with an 8-month history of a growing, painful tumor on her right buttock. The patient felt well otherwise and denied experiencing fevers, chills, sweats, weight loss, or malaise. Her medical history was notable for chronic kidney disease and genital herpes simplex virus (HSV). She reported no history of genital warts, HIV, or inflammatory bowel disease. A biopsy was performed, and results were consistent with a noninfectious, granulomatous ulcer. Based on the clinical appearance and prior pathologic findings, the patient received treatment of oral antibiotics, intralesional steroids, topical steroids, and immunomodulators, without improvement. Findings from colorectal surgical evaluation of the internal anal mucosa were negative for malignant neoplasm.At referral, physical examination findings revealed a 5 × 7-cm verrucous, exophytic tumor with scant yellow drainage on the right medial buttock extending to the perianal skin (Figure 1A). Findings from the remaining skin examination were normal. Superficial bacterial cultures were obtained from the lesion and grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. An incisional biopsy was performed for diagnostic clarification (Figure 1B and C).A, Clinical image of 5 × 7-cm verrucous, exophytic tumor with scant yellow drainage on the right medial buttock extending to the perianal skin.

Reasoning:
The patient is an older adult woman with a history of chronic kidney disease and genital herpes simplex virus (HSV). She presents with a 5 × 7-cm verrucous, exophytic tumor with scant yellow drainage on the right medial buttock extending to the perianal skin. The lesion is non-healing and has failed to respond to multiple treatment modalities, including oral antibiotics, intralesional steroids, topical steroids, and immunomodulators. Superficial bacterial cultures from the lesion grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. An incisional biopsy revealed a hyperplastic epidermis with ulceration, necrosis, and a very dense inflammatory infiltrate. The infiltrate was composed predominantly of plasma cells, while the epithelium showed focal multinucleated keratinocytes, some with gray-blue cytoplasm.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor). Giant condyloma acuminatum is a rare, sexually transmitted disease that is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). It is characterized by a large, cauliflower-like growth on the genitals or perianal area. The lesion is typically non-painful, but it can be pruritic and may bleed. Giant condyloma acuminatum can be difficult to treat, and it may recur after treatment. Treatment options include surgical excision, topical therapy, and immunotherapy.

Title: Rapidly Evolving Necrotic Plaques and Nodules in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A woman in her 50s presented to a tertiary dermatology referral center with scaly erythematous patches and plaques covering 10% of her total body surface area without clinically appreciable lymphadenopathy. Histopathological testing demonstrated an epidermotropic infiltrate of hyperchromatic, convoluted, atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei with basilar tagging and papillary dermal fibrosis. Studies of T-cell gene rearrangements identified a clonal population. Blood-flow cytometry did not reveal aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes. She was treated initially with topical and intralesional corticosteroids and narrow band UV B phototherapy. Oral bexarotene was subsequently added for recalcitrant disease. Within 2 months, she developed isolated, painful tumors. A second biopsy was performed, which was notable for an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD3+, CD4−, and CD8− weak lymphocytes, which were positive for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor (Bf) 1 and negative for CD30 and CD56. The results of flow cytometry and imaging were unremarkable. After an initial favorable response with chlorambucil, she developed expanding ulcerated tumors complicated by a polymicrobial superinfection. Chlorambucil was discontinued in favor of antimicrobial treatment. She then received liposomal doxorubicin, although skin involvement continued to progress rapidly, with ulcerating tumors making up as much as 80% of her total body surface area. She was hospitalized for worsening disease and pain (Figure, A). Repeated histopathologic analysis was done (Figure, B, C, and D).A, Clinical image. B, Original magnification ×50.

No other cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A punch biopsy specimen of the left medial forehead was obtained, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed.

The histopathological results revealed dissecting vascular channels (black arrowheads) and spindle cells (white arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin). Immunohistochemical staining revealed CD31 and diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive vascular neoplasm that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the head and neck region. It is typically seen in older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 60 years. The most common presentation is a rapidly growing, painless mass. Angiosarcoma can be difficult to diagnose, as it can mimic other skin conditions, such as hemangioma or pyogenic granuloma. Definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy.

There is no cure for angiosarcoma, but treatment can help to control the disease and improve quality of life. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for angiosarcoma is poor, with a median survival of 12-18 months.

Title: Tonsillar Hypertrophy in a Patient With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Case is: A 44-year-old man was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology from the Department of Sleep Medicine for surgical evaluation of his tonsillar hypertrophy. The patient’s medical history was notable for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosed in the fall of 2017, when he presented with snoring, progressive daytime fatigue, and several years of migraines. Since his diagnosis, he had been adherent to use of nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, he had persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches. Several months before presentation, the patient noticed that his bite changed from an overbite to an underbite (Figure, A), which had been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine. Examination findings of the oropharynx showed an oropharynx score of a Mallampati 4, with 3-plus tonsils and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue (Figure, B). Nasopharyngolaryngoscopic examination findings showed that the tonsils did not approximate at midline, with a narrow anterior-to-posterior dimension of the airway owing to macroglossia and no retrognathia.

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of acromegaly. Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder caused by excess production of growth hormone (GH) by a pituitary adenoma. The clinical features of acromegaly are related to the effects of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on tissues throughout the body. These effects can include enlargement of the hands, feet, face, and tongue; thickening of the skin; and changes in voice. The patient in this case reports a change in his bite, which is consistent with enlargement of the tongue. He also reports growth in his tongue and feet, which are other characteristic features of acromegaly. The patient's physical examination shows macroglossia and bilateral tonsillar hypertrophy, which are also consistent with acromegaly. The patient's symptoms of daytime fatigue and morning headaches are likely related to his sleep apnea, which is a common complication of acromegaly.

Title: An Abnormal Neck Mass in a Pediatric Patient Case is: A 17-year-old white male patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. His primary care physician initially obtained an ultrasonographic image, which demonstrated a left, level 2 lymph node measuring 4.0 × 1.5 × 2.8 cm. The patient then underwent several courses of antibiotic treatment, but the mass persisted. After a period of conservative management, he developed a sore throat and fever. He subsequently underwent a computed tomographic scan of the neck and chest with contrast, which demonstrated an isolated, enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node measuring 3.4 × 2.8 × 2.1 cm (Figure 1A). When he presented to our facility, he was found to have an asymptomatically enlarged left level 2/5A neck mass that was nontender and fixed. The patient had an unremarkable medical, surgical, and social history and no known infectious exposures. A white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were both elevated, at 11 310 cells/μL (to convert to cells × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and 56.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), respectively. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus had negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node was performed (Figure 1B).A, Axial computed tomographic (CT) scan of neck with contrast, showing homogenously enhancing 3.4-cm left level 2B neck mass.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 17-year-old white male with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass. The mass is nontender and fixed, and the patient has no known infectious exposures. The patient's white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level are both elevated. Studies for influenza A and B, HIV, cytomegalovirus, American foulbrood, Bartonella henselae, infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr virus have negative results. An ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy was performed, and fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture had negative results. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node was performed, which showed a regressed germinal center penetrated by a hyalinized vessel and small lymphocytes in mantle zone palisading around the residual germinal centers.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory disorder of the lymph nodes that typically affects young adults. The disease is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and a characteristic histopathologic appearance. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical and pathologic findings, and treatment is supportive.

Title: Sudden Onset of Multiple Green Spots in the Eyes of a Woman With Breast Cancer Case is: A 65-year-old white woman with stage IV breast cancer with metastases to the lungs and liver presented with a new onset of what she called “multiple green spots” in both eyes for 3 days. The spots were stationary; she denied any floaters or photopsias. The onset was simultaneous in both eyes, with no associated eye pain or photophobia. There was no ocular history, and a recent comprehensive eye examination had normal results. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. An anterior segment examination had unremarkable results. There was no vitritis, and her optic nerves were pink and sharp. A dilated fundus examination revealed multifocal, hypopigmented, cream-colored spots scattered throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. These spots were hyperautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence and localized to the subretinal space (Figure 1). Notably, 2 weeks prior to presentation, she had started taking cobimetinib therapy as part of a clinical trial for her breast cancer.Fundus autofluorescence (A) demonstrating multiple, discrete hyperautofluorescent lesions throughout the posterior pole, concentrated along the superior arcades; spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (B) shows small, localized subretinal fluid pockets at the site of these lesions.What Would You Do Next?

Title: A Mysterious Central Scotoma in a Teenage Male Patient Case is: A white teenage boy was referred for 3 months of bilateral reduced central visual acuity characterized as atraumatic, painless, constant, symmetric, and nonprogressive. His parents reported that he had recently been hospitalized for a suspected overdose with the medications atomoxetine, quetiapine, melatonin, fluoxetine, bupropion, and clonazepam, and shortly after, he reported central visual acuity loss. A dilated fundus examination with normal results had been documented 6 months prior to our examination.His ocular history was unremarkable. His medical history included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and learning disabilities. His medications included atomoxetine, quetiapine, melatonin, and fluoxetine. The patient was adopted, and a detailed family history was unknown. A social history was limited. The patient was born full term. His biological sister has learning and attention difficulties but had a normal fundus examination result.The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/60 OS. His intraocular pressure, pupils, extraocular movements, visual fields, and color testing results were normal. The anterior segments were unremarkable. The vitreous, optic nerve, and retinal vasculature were normal. A bilateral maculopathy was present, with focal areas of gray-brown discoloration (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) exhibited an intact foveal depression with subfoveal disruption of the ellipsoid layer and hyperreflective material extending into the Henle layer (Figure 1B). No subretinal or intraretinal fluid was present.A, Fundus photograph of the left eye demonstrates a central maculopathy with focal gray discolored lesions and yellow-orange pigmentation. B, Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the same eye reveal ellipsoid zone disruption and vertical hyperreflective bands.

A: Stop all psychiatric medications , B: Obtain an electroretinogram , C: Inquire about bright light exposures , D: Prescribe oral steroids. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of drug-induced maculopathy. This is a rare but well-recognized complication of certain medications, including atomoxetine, quetiapine, and melatonin. The typical presentation is bilateral, central visual acuity loss that is atraumatic, painless, constant, symmetric, and nonprogressive. On examination, there is often a maculopathy with focal areas of gray-brown discoloration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) typically shows an intact foveal depression with subfoveal disruption of the ellipsoid layer and hyperreflective material extending into the Henle layer. No subretinal or intraretinal fluid is present.

The first step in management is to stop the offending medication. In some cases, visual function may improve spontaneously. However, if there is no improvement, or if the visual loss is severe, other treatment options may be considered, such as oral steroids or photodynamic therapy.

Answer: A. Stop all psychiatric medications.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of drug-induced maculopathy. The first step in management is to stop the offending medication. In this case, the patient is taking atomoxetine, quetiapine, and melatonin. These medications are all known to cause maculopathy. Stopping these medications is the most likely to improve the patient's visual function.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Obtaining an electroretinogram (ERG) would not be helpful in diagnosing or managing drug-induced maculopathy. An ERG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is used to diagnose a variety of retinal disorders, but it is not specific for drug-induced maculopathy. Inquiring about bright light exposures is also not necessary in this case. The patient's history and examination findings do not suggest that bright light exposure is the cause of his visual loss. Prescribing oral steroids is not appropriate in this case. Steroids are sometimes used to treat drug-induced maculopathy, but they are not effective in all cases. In addition, steroids can have serious side effects, so they should only be used when necessary.

Title: Acute-Onset Visual Acuity Loss in a Man With Advanced Diabetes Mellitus Case is: A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department in October with acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye of 2 days’ duration associated with right periorbital pain. His medical history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus of 40 years’ duration complicated by end-stage renal disease requiring a renal transplant and ongoing immunosuppression. His visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/40 OS. The right eye exhibited an amaurotic pupil, severe generalized restriction of extraocular movement, and ptosis with poor levator function. His intraocular pressures were normal. At a base of 104 mm, exophthalmometer measurements were 24 mm OD and 20 mm OS. The results of a slitlamp examination were noncontributory in both eyes. A dilated fundus examination revealed a pale optic disc in the right eye and panretinal laser scars in both eyes. Cranial nerves V and VII-XII were intact bilaterally. The patient was afebrile, with vital signs within normal limits. His leukocyte count was 2200 cells/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001).Noncontrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit demonstrated highly attenuating debris and bony irregularities throughout the paranasal sinuses and fat stranding in the right orbital apex (Figure). Magnetic resonance venography of the head had unremarkable results. Results of a sinus biopsy by the otolaryngology service demonstrated fungal hyphal elements. Systemic therapy was initiated, and the otolaryngology service planned urgent surgical nasosinal debridement. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was withheld pending stabilization in the patient’s renal status.Orbital noncontrast imaging studies. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) (A) and magnetic resonance imaging (B), images of the orbit. Computed tomography demonstrates inflammatory changes of the right medial orbital wall (arrowhead). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates inflammatory changes at the right orbital apex (arrowhead). Both images demonstrate nasosinal inflammation.Await improvement in renal status and perform contrast-enhanced imagingPerform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agentWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: A Translucent Nodule of the Nipple in an Elderly Male Patient Case is: A male patient in his 70s presented an asymptomatic, slightly eroded, translucent nodule on his right nipple (Figure, A). There was a family history of cutaneous melanoma in his 2 sisters, daughter, and nephew and breast cancer in his mother and sister. We completed genetic testing of family members and found no genetic mutations in sera samples to predispose them to melanoma skin cancer or breast cancer. The main genes tested were the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1), breast cancer 2–DNA repair associated (BRCA2), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) genes. A dermoscopic examination of the patient showed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion (Figure, B). A punch biopsy was performed.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Basal cell carcinoma , B: Amelanotic melanoma , C: Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast , D: Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cutaneous melanoma in his 2 sisters, daughter, and nephew and breast cancer in his mother and sister. He presents with an asymptomatic, slightly eroded, translucent nodule on his right nipple. A dermoscopic examination of the lesion shows a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion. A punch biopsy was performed.

The differential diagnosis for a translucent nodule of the nipple includes basal cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, and erosive adenomatosis of the nipple.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It is usually a slow-growing, non-cancerous tumor that rarely spreads to other parts of the body. However, it can be locally destructive and disfiguring.

Amelanotic melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that does not produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. It is often difficult to diagnose because it does not have the typical black or brown appearance of melanoma.

Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast is a type of breast cancer that starts in the ducts that carry milk from the breast to the nipple. It is the most common type of breast cancer.

Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple is a rare condition that causes inflammation and erosion of the nipple. It is usually associated with breast cancer.

The patient's history of cutaneous melanoma in his family members and the presence of an asymptomatic, slightly eroded, translucent nodule on his right nipple are concerning for amelanotic melanoma. The dermoscopic findings of a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion are also consistent with amelanotic melanoma.

The patient underwent a punch biopsy, which revealed amelanotic melanoma.

Title: Progressive Dyspnea in a Woman With Genital Skin Lesions Case is: An 82-year-old woman presented with dyspnea on exertion and weight gain of 5 kg over the past month. Her medical history included atrial fibrillation and lung adenocarcinoma (a lung lobectomy was performed 8 years ago). Her blood pressure was 112/60 mm Hg, her heart rate was 100 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 37 breaths per minute, her body temperature was 36.6°C, and her oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing 10 L of oxygen. A cardiac examination was clinically significant for an irregular rhythm, an increased pulmonic closure sound, and jugular venous distension. Bibasilar coarse crackles and pretibial edema were also noted. A complete blood count had results within normal limits. The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 278 U/L (to convert to microkatal per liter, multiply by 0.0167). A chest radiographic image showed bibasilar infiltrates. An electrocardiogram was notable for atrial fibrillation, and echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function, mild right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe tricuspid regurgitation (transtricuspid pressure gradient, 40 mm Hg). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography image revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and right basilar consolidations, with no evidence of thromboembolisms (Figure, A). Para-aortic and inguinal lymphadenopathies were also noted. Presumptive diagnoses of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right-sided heart failure were made. The patient began receiving dobutamine and furosemide, but she continuously required 2 to 10 L of oxygen, and further invasive evaluations could not be performed. An echocardiogram identified aggravating PH (transtricuspid pressure gradient, 57 mm Hg). A thorough physical examination identified scaly, crusty genital skin lesions pathologically compatible with extramammary Paget disease. The patient deteriorated and died despite treatment. An autopsy was performed (Figure, B).A, The chest computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities (white arrowheads) and consolidative lesions (a yellow arrowhead), but no evidence of thromboembolism was obtained. B, Hematoxylin-eosin stain of the lung showed proliferation of intimal fibromuscular cells with (yellow arrowheads) or without (black arrowheads) the presence of Paget cells.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and lung adenocarcinoma (a lung lobectomy was performed 8 years ago). She presents with dyspnea on exertion and weight gain of 5 kg over the past month. Her physical examination is significant for an irregular rhythm, an increased pulmonic closure sound, jugular venous distension, bibasilar coarse crackles, and pretibial edema. A complete blood count had results within normal limits. The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 278 U/L (to convert to microkatal per liter, multiply by 0.0167). A chest radiographic image showed bibasilar infiltrates. An electrocardiogram was notable for atrial fibrillation, and echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function, mild right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe tricuspid regurgitation (transtricuspid pressure gradient, 40 mm Hg). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography image revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and right basilar consolidations, with no evidence of thromboembolisms. Para-aortic and inguinal lymphadenopathies were also noted. Presumptive diagnoses of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right-sided heart failure were made. The patient began receiving dobutamine and furosemide, but she continuously required 2 to 10 L of oxygen, and further invasive evaluations could not be performed. An echocardiogram identified aggravating PH (transtricuspid pressure gradient, 57 mm Hg). A thorough physical examination identified scaly, crusty genital skin lesions pathologically compatible with extramammary Paget disease. The patient deteriorated and died despite treatment. An autopsy was performed.

The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTMA). PTTMA is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by the formation of microvascular thrombi in the lungs, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and death. It is most commonly associated with malignancy, particularly adenocarcinoma of the lung. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment is supportive and includes anticoagulation, blood transfusion, and management of right heart failure.

The patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma is a strong risk factor for PTTMA. The development of dyspnea on exertion and weight gain over the past month are consistent with the development of pulmonary hypertension. The physical examination findings of an irregular rhythm, an increased pulmonic closure sound, jugular venous distension, bibasilar coarse crackles, and pretibial edema are all consistent with right heart failure. The chest radiographic image showed bibasilar infiltrates, which can be seen in PTTMA. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, which is a common arrhythmia in patients with PTTMA. The echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function, mild right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe tricuspid regurgitation, which are all consistent with right heart failure. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography image showed bilateral ground-glass opacities and right basilar consolidations, which can be seen in PTTMA. The para-aortic and inguinal lymphadenopathies are likely due to metastatic disease from the lung adenocarcinoma.

The patient's scaly, crusty genital skin lesions are pathologically compatible with extramammary Paget disease. Paget disease is a rare skin cancer that can occur in the genital area. It is thought to be caused by the spread of malignant cells from an underlying adenocarcinoma. The presence of Paget disease in this patient further supports the diagnosis of PTTMA.

The patient's deterioration and death despite treatment are consistent with the poor prognosis of PTTMA. The median survival for patients with PTTMA is less than 6 months.

Title: A 61-Year-Old Woman With New Pericardial Effusion Case is: A 61-year-old woman presented with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope. She had a medical history of end-stage renal disease secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, after renal transplant 5 years prior. She had concomitant polycystic liver disease and had undergone right hepatectomy and cyst fenestration, plus inferior vena cava (IVC) stent placement for intrahepatic caval compression due to hepatic cysts 9 years earlier. Initial laboratory evaluation results revealed elevated creatinine levels with concern of renal graft failure. Physical examination results revealed a blood pressure of 96/65 mm Hg, an elevated jugular venous pressure with blunted Y-descent, Kussmaul sign, and distant heart sounds. Chest radiography results revealed cardiomegaly and the IVC stent was evident, adjacent to her heart (Figure, A). Echocardiography (Video 1 and Figure, B) revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse, and exaggerated respiratory variation (>25%) in the mitral inflow velocity but a normal inferior vena cava size.Chest radiography and transthoracic echocardiogram illustrating cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion in addition to visualization of the inferior vena cava stent.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient has a large pericardial effusion with diastolic right ventricular collapse. This is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent intervention. The most likely cause of the pericardial effusion is the IVC stent, which is compressing the inferior vena cava and preventing venous return to the heart. The patient also has elevated creatinine levels, which suggests that her renal function is deteriorating. This is likely due to the compression of the renal vein by the IVC stent.

The best course of action is to urgently remove the IVC stent. This can be done by a vascular surgeon. Once the stent is removed, the pericardial effusion should resolve and the patient's renal function should improve.

Title: Indolent Laryngeal Mass Causing Progressive Dysphagia Case is: A 29-year-old man with a history of reactive airway disease and eczema presented to the clinic with progressive odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia of solids, liquids, and secretions for the past 6 months. There were no respiratory symptoms, and results of a complete head and neck physical examination were unremarkable. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy was performed and revealed erythema and swelling to the right arytenoid. A 2-week course of doxycycline was completed for presumed infectious supraglottitis without a change in symptoms. A biopsy and culture of the lesion was then collected in the office and revealed inflammatory disease but ultimately was nondiagnostic. The patient chose observation vs further workup at that time.The patient returned 6 months later with worsening symptoms. Repeat flexible nasolaryngoscopy was performed and revealed significant edema of the right arytenoid extending into the aryepiglottic fold, limiting the mobility of the right vocal fold (Figure 1). Microdirect laryngoscopy and biopsy under general anesthesia was performed, and a specimen was sent to the pathology department for permanent section analysis and flow cytometry. Permanent sections showed unremarkable squamous mucosa. Flow cytometry revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate and an increased plasma cell component.

Results of stains for infectious organisms were negative. Further immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis. A full-body nuclear magnetic resonance positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan was performed to rule out systemic disease.

The most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into tissues. It can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, kidneys, pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Laryngeal involvement is seen in up to 20% of patients with IgG4-RD.

The patient's history of reactive airway disease and eczema is consistent with atopy, which is a risk factor for IgG4-RD. The patient's symptoms of odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia are also consistent with laryngeal involvement. The findings on flexible nasolaryngoscopy and biopsy are also consistent with IgG4-RD. The full-body nuclear magnetic resonance positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan was negative for systemic disease, which further supports the diagnosis of IgG4-RD.

Treatment for IgG4-RD is with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The patient in this case was treated with a course of steroids and his symptoms improved significantly.

Title: An Unusual Nasal Septal Lesion in an Adult Patient Case is: A 31-year-old female patient presented with right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. She reported feeling a mass in her right nostril that had not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. Prior to presentation, she had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. She denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She was a nonsmoker and nondrinker. On physical examination, her external nose had no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. Her turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage (Figure 1A and B).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The most likely diagnosis is a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are benign, highly vascular tumors that are most commonly found in the head and neck, particularly the middle ear and paranasal sinuses. They are typically small, round, and firm, and they may be associated with pain, tenderness, and bleeding. The patient in this case presents with a history of right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. She also reports feeling a mass in her right nostril that has not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of glomus tumor.

On physical examination, the patient had a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion on the right anterior nasal septum. This is also consistent with a diagnosis of glomus tumor. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage. These findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of glomus tumor.

Title: Nasal Polyps, Multifocal Laryngeal Masses, and Subglottic Stenosis in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A 52-year-old man who had recently emigrated from Guatemala and had a history of asthma presented to the emergency department with exacerbation of long-standing dyspnea along with progressively worsening nasal congestion and dysphonia over the past 2 years. He was diagnosed with asthma 2 years earlier when he first started experiencing shortness of breath and had partial relief with inhaled albuterol treatments only. He had no history of fevers, dysphagia, odynophagia, cough, or allergies.On physical examination, moderately severe dysphonia characterized primarily by roughness with mild breathiness as well as mild inspiratory stridor were noted. Anterior rhinoscopy demonstrated large, bilateral obstructive nasal polyps. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed smooth, lobulated masses involving the epiglottis and right aryepiglottic fold. The epiglottic component extended inferiorly along the petiole, involving and obstructing the anterior glottis. The vocal fold mucosa was thickened, but bilateral mobility was intact with an adequate posterior glottic airway.Computed tomography demonstrated homogenous, isodense, laryngeal lesions that correlated with the previously mentioned laryngoscopy findings, but also showed subglottic stenosis approximately 2 cm in length secondary to the thickened intraluminal soft tissue (Figure, A). The cartilaginous laryngotracheal framework was preserved. The chest radiograph was unremarkable. The patient was taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy with endoscopic airway dilation and laryngeal mass biopsy (Figure, B, C, and D).A, Subglottic stenosis was noted on computed tomography (yellow arrowhead).

Title: Diffuse Palatal Swelling in a Woman in Her 60s Case is: A healthy woman in her 60s was referred by her dentist to an oral surgeon for evaluation of a palatal swelling of unknown duration. The patient first presented to her dentist with a complaint of “it feels like there is something on the roof of [her] mouth.” She was never aware of the palatal lesion before her initial presentation. She denied any pain or discomfort from the site, and stated that the increasing size of the mass was what first alerted her to its presence.The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa (Figure, A). The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable.A, A clinical image shows a diffuse, right-sided palatal swelling with a focal ulceration. B, A photomicrograph shows sheets of large lymphocytes with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×200). The lesional cells stained positively with CD20 (inset) (original magnification, ×400).An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed and showed fibrous connective tissues infiltrated by inflammatory cells arranged in a diffuse, sheetlike pattern. The cells were large with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and appeared to be round to oval vesicular nuclei with vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli (Figure, B). The cells stained positively with CD45, CD20 (Figure, B, inset), CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a healthy woman in her 60s who presents with a diffuse palatal swelling of unknown duration. She denies any pain or discomfort, and the lesion is not ulcerated. The extraoral examination results are within normal limits, and imaging studies are unremarkable. An incisional biopsy of the lesion shows sheets of large lymphocytes with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli. The cells stained positively with CD45, CD20, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies.

Given the patient's history, presentation, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the proliferation of large B-lymphocytes. It is the most common type of lymphoma in adults, and it can occur at any age. DLBCL can arise in any part of the body, but it is most common in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.

The symptoms of DLBCL can vary depending on the location of the tumor. However, common symptoms include fatigue, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and swollen lymph nodes. DLBCL can also cause symptoms related to the organ or tissue in which it is located. For example, if DLBCL occurs in the bone marrow, it can cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.

The diagnosis of DLBCL is made based on a biopsy of the affected tissue. The biopsy will show the presence of large B-lymphocytes. DLBCL is also classified based on the Ann Arbor staging system. The Ann Arbor staging system is based on the size of the tumor, the presence of lymph node involvement, and the presence of extranodal disease.

The treatment for DLBCL depends on the stage of the disease, the patient's age and overall health, and the presence of any other medical conditions. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

Title: Subcutaneous Emphysema of the Neck With Pneumomediastinum Case is: A man in his 30s presented to an outside emergency department with left-sided otalgia and periauricular swelling. He was discharged after being prescribed oral antibiotics but continued to have worsening symptoms and returned to the outside facility, where a noncontrasted computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck and chest showed significant subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and mediastinum (Figure, A and B). He was subsequently transferred to our facility for additional treatment.A. Intraluminal air in the left parotid duct with associated pneumoparotid and dissection of air into the left parapharyngeal and masticator spaces. Pneumoparotid is also noted on the right. B. Inferior dissection of subcutaneous emphysema resulting in pneumomediastinum. Air has dissected around the left common carotid artery near its origin from the aortic arch. C. Frothy air bubbles milked from the parotid duct with external massage of the parotid gland.On evaluation, the patient noted a week of worsening facial swelling, neck pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. Importantly, the patient noted that he was capable of a “party trick” which involved puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck with subsequent decompression of air back into his oral cavity by pushing behind his ear. This became a habitual behavior, which the patient performed multiple times per day. On examination, there was a tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible without significant crepitus (Video). Additional examination findings are demonstrated in the Figure, C.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Esophageal perforation , B: Necrotizing fasciitis , C: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum , D: Pneumoparotid. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history of a "party trick" involving puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck with subsequent decompression of air back into his oral cavity by pushing behind his ear is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pneumoparotid. This is a rare condition that is caused by the introduction of air into the parotid gland, typically through trauma or infection. The air can then dissect into the surrounding tissues, including the subcutaneous space of the neck and the mediastinum.

Pneumoparotid is usually a self-limiting condition, but it can occasionally lead to serious complications, such as infection or airway obstruction. In this case, the patient's symptoms of facial swelling, neck pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia are consistent with a diagnosis of pneumoparotid. The physical examination findings of a tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible without significant crepitus are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's CT scan findings of intraluminal air in the left parotid duct with associated pneumoparotid and dissection of air into the left parapharyngeal and masticator spaces are also consistent with a diagnosis of pneumoparotid.

Title: Corneal Deposits in a Patient With Anti–Interferon-γ Autoantibody Syndrome Case is: A woman in her 30s was referred for evaluation of corneal opacities. Her medical history was notable for keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and anti–interferon-γ autoantibody syndrome treated with 6 monthly rituximab infusions (375 mg/m2 with 100 mg of methylprednisolone acetate). Infusions were given weekly for the first 3 weeks and then every 6 to 8 months based on a CD20 count. She had previously been diagnosed with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection requiring 2 years of treatment with rifabutin, 300 mg/d; ethambutol hydrochloride, 1000 mg/d; and clarithromycin in a divided dose, 500 mg twice a day. This treatment concluded 2½ years before presentation. In addition, she had a long-standing history of arthralgias with intermittent arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine, 300 mg/d, that was discontinued 2 years before presentation. On examination, she had no visual concerns. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Conjunctivas were normal, lenses were clear, and anterior chambers were deep and quiet. The results from the slitlamp examination showed numerous bilateral, peripheral light brown corneal opacities. The opacities were located in the far posterior corneae and were present circumferentially (Figure, A). There was no associated keratitis or corneal neovascularization. Anterior segment optical coherence tomographic findings showed focal areas of hyperreflectivity anterior to the Descemet membrane. Confocal microscopy revealed variably shaped, hyperreflective clusters of opacities just anterior to the endothelium (Figure, B).Imaging of the right eye of a patient with rifabutin-related posterior corneal deposits. A, Slitlamp photograph with arrowhead highlighting one of numerous bilateral peripheral, small corneal light brown opacities.

Title: Anterior Optic Neuropathy in a Patient With Cyclical Fevers Case is: A 41-year-old man presented for evaluation of 2 weeks of blurred vision and pain in the left eye. The onset of vision decrease coincided with muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache. All of the symptoms except blurry vision resolved spontaneously after 3 days. Over the preceding 5 months, he had had approximately monthly similar episodes consisting of a few days of flulike symptoms and blurry vision, with full recovery between episodes. At the time of evaluation, the vision was decreased in the left eye, with pain in both eyes and deep throbbing in the back of the left eye.Visual acuity was 20/20 OD and counting fingers at 1 ft OS, with visual field constriction and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The examination of the anterior segment bilaterally was unremarkable, as was the posterior segment examination of his right eye. However, the fundus examination of the left eye showed extensive optic nerve swelling, with nerve fiber layer hemorrhage at the inferior temporal disc margin and peripapillary subretinal fluid extending to the macula (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits showed anterior swelling of the left optic nerve without masses or hyperintensity of the retrobulbar optic nerve.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history and presentation are consistent with anterior optic neuropathy, a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, inflammation, and demyelination. The patient's history of flu-like symptoms and blurry vision, with full recovery between episodes, suggests that the optic neuropathy may be inflammatory in nature. The MRI findings of anterior swelling of the left optic nerve without masses or hyperintensity of the retrobulbar optic nerve are also consistent with an inflammatory process.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, it would be appropriate to order blood tests for infectious and inflammatory agents. These tests could help to identify the specific cause of the optic neuropathy and guide treatment. In addition, the patient could be treated with oral prednisone, a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation.

Title: Retinal Pigment Abnormalities in a Woman With Diabetes Case is: A 49-year-old woman presented for evaluation of abnormal retinal pigmentation and concern for cancer-associated retinopathy. The patient reported having difficulty with night driving owing to glare. She reported no other ocular history. The patient’s medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes diagnosed in her 30s and managed with metformin therapy, hypertension, mild hearing loss, and thyroid cancer that was in remission following thyroidectomy and radiotherapy. The patient had been told that radioactive iodine therapy damaged her pancreas and predisposed her to diabetes. The patient denied exposure to retinotoxic drugs.On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. The anterior segment examination findings were unremarkable except for trace nuclear sclerosis in each eye. Dilated fundus examination revealed peripapillary atrophy and scattered macular pigment clumps in each eye.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, mild hearing loss, and thyroid cancer that is in remission following thyroidectomy and radiotherapy. She presents with abnormal retinal pigmentation and concern for cancer-associated retinopathy. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 OU. The anterior segment examination findings are unremarkable except for trace nuclear sclerosis in each eye.

Optical coherence tomography of the macula demonstrated hyperreflective retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) lesions with no intraretinal or subretinal fluid. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) testing was suggestive of mild cone system dysfunction in each eye.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and cancer-associated retinopathy. Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in older adults. It is characterized by the accumulation of drusen, which are small deposits of extracellular material, and the formation of geographic atrophy, which is a loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss. It is characterized by the development of microaneurysms, which are small, saccular dilations of retinal capillaries, and neovascularisation, which is the growth of new blood vessels from the choroid into the retina. Cancer-associated retinopathy is a rare condition that can occur in patients with a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. It is characterized by the development of retinal pigment epithelial changes, including atrophy and hyperpigmentation, and visual symptoms, including night blindness and decreased visual acuity.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing. This is because cancer-associated retinopathy is a genetic condition that can be inherited. If the patient has a positive family history of cancer-associated retinopathy, then she may be at increased risk of developing the condition herself. Genetic testing can help to determine if the patient carries the gene mutation that is associated with cancer-associated retinopathy. If the patient does carry the gene mutation, then she may be offered preventive treatment, such as laser therapy or photodynamic therapy, to reduce her risk of developing vision loss.

**Reasoning:**

Ocular juvenile xanthogranuloma (OJX) is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically presents in children under the age of 10 years. It is characterized by a triad of iris nodules, retinal vasculitis, and cataracts. The most common presenting symptom is unilateral redness and photophobia. OJX can be treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids, but recurrence is common.

In this case, the patient is a 19-year-old man with a history of recurrent left eye redness and photophobia for the past year. He has been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. The patient's visual acuity is 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye are within normal limits. Examination results of the left eye demonstrate 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate. Results of the dilated fundus examination are within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrates areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes OJX, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and toxoplasmosis. OJX is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's age, history, and clinical findings. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have any other joint symptoms. Sarcoidosis is also a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have any skin lesions or pulmonary involvement. Toxoplasmosis is a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have any history of cat exposure or recent travel to an area with a high prevalence of toxoplasmosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a biopsy of the iris lesion. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of OJX and to rule out other possible diagnoses. If the biopsy is positive for OJX, the patient can be treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids. Recurrence is common, so the patient will need to be monitored closely.

The most likely diagnosis is annular pustular psoriasis. Annular pustular psoriasis is a rare, chronic, recurrent form of psoriasis that typically affects middle-aged and elderly men. It is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple, well-demarcated, annular plaques with central clearing and a peripheral ring of pustules. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and proximal extremities, but can occur anywhere on the body. The cause of annular pustular psoriasis is unknown, but it is thought to be a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorder. The diagnosis of annular pustular psoriasis is based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Treatment of annular pustular psoriasis is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing the recurrence of lesions. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, phototherapy, and acitretin.

Title: Facial Asymmetry With Deviated Nasal Tip Case is: A woman in her 40s presented to the dermatology clinic with a 10-year history of progressive skin thickening and subcutaneous enlargement of the right side of her nose and right cheek. She had been seen by several dermatologists and otolaryngologists and had undergone nondiagnostic skin biopsies. She underwent a septorhinoplasty 6 months prior to presentation because of collapse of her right nasal ala. During the surgical procedure, the surgeon noted a significant amount of submucosal tissue in the right nasal cavity, which was removed; histopathological analysis was performed, and the results were reported as fibroadipose tissue and vascular proliferation. A skin biopsy was performed at the time of the surgical procedure and was interpreted as sebaceous hyperplasia.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 40s who presented with a 10-year history of progressive skin thickening and subcutaneous enlargement of the right side of her nose and right cheek. She had been seen by several dermatologists and otolaryngologists and had undergone nondiagnostic skin biopsies. She underwent a septorhinoplasty 6 months prior to presentation because of collapse of her right nasal ala. During the surgical procedure, the surgeon noted a significant amount of submucosal tissue in the right nasal cavity, which was removed; histopathological analysis was performed, and the results were reported as fibroadipose tissue and vascular proliferation. A skin biopsy was performed at the time of the surgical procedure and was interpreted as sebaceous hyperplasia. The patient initially had improvement in her skin, but she again noticed enlargement of the soft tissue with thickening of the overlying skin on her right cheek and right side of her nose several months later. Clinical examination revealed slightly hyperplastic soft tissue with dilated patulous follicles involving the right medial malar cheek and right nasal ala in addition to deviation of the nasal tip. The surgical pathology specimens from her septorhinoplasty were obtained and reviewed.

The most likely diagnosis is spindle cell lipoma. Spindle cell lipomas are a rare subtype of lipoma that are characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells within mature adipose tissue. They are typically found in the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities, but they can also occur in the head and neck region. The clinical presentation of spindle cell lipoma is variable, but it can include a painless mass, skin ulceration, and facial asymmetry. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathological examination, which shows a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells within mature adipose tissue. Treatment of spindle cell lipoma is typically surgical excision.

The other possible diagnoses are lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and diffuse pattern neurofibroma. Lupus panniculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect the subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of adipose tissue. The clinical presentation of lupus panniculitis is variable, but it can include a painful, erythematous, and tender mass. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, histopathological examination, and serological testing. Treatment of lupus panniculitis is typically with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm that can arise from the dermis. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells. The clinical presentation of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is variable, but it can include a painless, solitary, nodular mass. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, histopathological examination, and imaging studies. Treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is typically with surgical excision. Diffuse pattern neurofibroma is a rare, non-neoplastic disorder of peripheral nerves. It is characterized by a proliferation of Schwann cells within the nerve sheath. The clinical presentation of diffuse pattern neurofibroma is variable, but it can include a painless, soft, subcutaneous mass. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, histopathological examination, and imaging studies. Treatment of diffuse pattern neurofibroma is typically with surgical excision.

Clinical examination revealed slightly hyperplastic soft tissue with dilated patulous follicles involving the right medial malar cheek and right nasal ala in addition to deviation of the nasal tip. The surgical pathology specimens from her septorhinoplasty were obtained and reviewed.

The diagnosis of lupus panniculitis is unlikely because the patient does not have any other features of systemic lupus erythematosus, such as joint pain, fever, or malar rash.

The diagnosis of spindle cell lipoma is more likely because the patient has a history of progressive skin thickening and subcutaneous enlargement of the right side of her nose and right cheek. The histopathological findings of an interstitial proliferation of spindle cells within mature adipocytes that extends between bundles of skeletal muscle are also consistent with a diagnosis of spindle cell lipoma.

The diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is less likely because the patient does not have any other features of this condition, such as a history of trauma or a solitary skin lesion.

The diagnosis of diffuse pattern neurofibroma is also less likely because the patient does not have any other features of neurofibromatosis, such as café au lait spots or multiple skin lesions.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is spindle cell lipoma.

Title: Recurrent Blistering in an Infant Case is: An infant boy, born to a nonconsanguineously wed couple, presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic with recurrent skin blisters since age 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected.On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities (Figure, A and B). Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed (Figure, C and D).A, Multiple angulated vesicles and tense bullae over the forehead and chin. Background erythema can be appreciated. B, Tense bullae over the trunk with superficial erosions and postinflammatory hypopigmentation, which are healing with scarring and discrete milia formation.

D, Higher magnification showing dense infiltrate of mast cells in the upper dermis. Mast cells can be identified by ovoid to spindle-shaped nuclei (hematoxylin and eosin stain).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa , B: Chronic bullous disease of childhood , C: Bullous mastocytosis , D: Congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The most likely diagnosis is bullous mastocytosis. This is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of blisters and wheals (hives) that are caused by an accumulation of mast cells in the skin. Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that release histamine and other inflammatory mediators when they are activated, which can lead to the symptoms of bullous mastocytosis.

The patient in this case presents with a history of recurrent skin blisters since the age of 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters are accompanied by pruritus (itching) and redness all over the body. There is no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements are normal. The child has an older sibling who has no skin ailments, and none of the other family members are affected.

On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities. Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed, which showed a subepidermal bulla with bandlike mast cell infiltrate in the upper dermis.

The clinical features and histopathologic findings in this case are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes other blistering disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa, bullous pemphigoid, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. However, the presence of mast cells in the skin biopsy is a key feature that helps to distinguish bullous mastocytosis from these other disorders.

Title: Treatment of First-Episode Schizophrenia in a Young Woman Case is: A 20-year-old woman was referred by her family physician to a community mental health team in London, United Kingdom. Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for useWhat Would You Do Next? A: Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use , B: Commence treatment with oral olanzapine , C: Commence treatment with oral clozapine , D: Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 20-year-old woman with a first-episode diagnosis of schizophrenia. She has been experiencing auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and social withdrawal for the past 12 months. She has no history of substance abuse or other medical illnesses. Her family history is significant for schizophrenia in a paternal relative.

The first step in treating this patient is to establish a diagnosis. The patient's symptoms are consistent with schizophrenia, but it is important to rule out other possible causes, such as a mood disorder or a substance-induced psychosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the next step is to initiate treatment.

The first-line treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Olanzapine is a first-generation antipsychotic that is effective in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. It is also relatively safe and well-tolerated. Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is more effective than olanzapine in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, it is also more likely to cause side effects, such as agranulocytosis.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that can be helpful in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. CBT can help patients to identify and change the negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms.

In this case, I would recommend starting the patient on olanzapine. I would also recommend referring her for CBT.

Title: A Diffuse Medullary Hypercaptation With No Bone Lesion Case is: A 71-year-old man had a 3-year history of a recurrent seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which were treated with pericardiectomy and prednisone and azathioprine. The pleural fluid was transudative and sterile, and the pericardium contained focal lymphoplasmacytic aggregates. Attempts to taper immunosuppressive drugs failed because of a recrudescence of the inflammatory syndrome and pericardial effusion. The patient was admitted with fever of unknown origin with a surge of the inflammatory syndrome and pancytopenia. He reported night sweats beginning 3 weeks prior associated with fever and unintentional weight loss. No lymphadenopathy was noted.Laboratory evaluations demonstrated a C-reactive protein level of 133 mg/L (reference range, <10 mg/L); ferritin level of 2607 ng/mL (reference, 30-300 ng/mL); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 289 U/L (reference, 135-214 U/L); pancytopenia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL (reference, 13.3-17.7 g/dL), white blood cell count of 2700/μL (reference, 4000-10 000/μL), and platelet count of 99 ×103/μL (reference, 150-350 ×103/μL); and prerenal acute kidney injury (Acute Kidney Injury Network stage 1) with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (reference, 0.7-1.2 mg/dL). Results of a comprehensive serologic workup were negative. Gastroscopy results showed mycotic distal esophagitis.The patient was readmitted 3 weeks later with fever and hypotension without improvement despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Considering the increase in ferritin and LDH levels and pancytopenia, a hematologic disease was suspected. The patient did not report any bone pain. Computed tomography (CT) results showed a splenomegaly without evidence of metastatic disease or lymph node enlargement. Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT imaging (Figure, A and B) and a bone-marrow biopsy (Figure, C and D) were performed. A rapidly evolving sepsislike syndrome led to the patient’s death.Fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography–computed tomography imaging results show diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow (A) and spleen (B). The entire skeleton is highly metabolic, which suggests advanced bone-marrow involvement. C, Bone-marrow biopsy results show a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements (immunoperoxidase, original magnification ×200). D, Immunostaining shows lymphoid infiltrate strongly positive for paired box protein Pax-5 (immunoperoxidase, original magnification ×200).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Infectious bone-marrow disease , B: Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma , C: Primary bone lymphoma , D: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient's history of recurrent seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which were treated with pericardiectomy and prednisone and azathioprine, suggests that he has an underlying autoimmune disorder. The development of fever of unknown origin with a surge of the inflammatory syndrome and pancytopenia suggests that he may have developed a hematologic malignancy. The laboratory findings of a high C-reactive protein level, high ferritin level, high lactate dehydrogenase level, and pancytopenia are all consistent with this diagnosis. The CT findings of splenomegaly without evidence of metastatic disease or lymph node enlargement are also consistent with a hematologic malignancy. The PET-CT imaging findings of diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow and spleen are highly suggestive of a hematologic malignancy. The bone-marrow biopsy findings of a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements are also consistent with a hematologic malignancy. The immunostaining showing the lymphoid infiltrate strongly positive for paired box protein Pax-5 is further evidence of a hematologic malignancy.

**Answer:**
The most likely diagnosis is B: Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma.

Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma is a rare subtype of large B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with fever, weight loss, and pancytopenia. The disease is characterized by a diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow, liver, and spleen by large B cells. The diagnosis is made on the basis of a bone-marrow biopsy. The treatment of bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma is with chemotherapy.

Title: Wide Complex Tachycardia in a Woman in Her 30s With Electrolyte Derangements Case is: A woman in her 30s with active bulimia was brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a syncopal event that followed 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. When emergency responders arrived, the patient was responsive but groggy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) in the field demonstrated a regular wide complex tachycardia. En route to the hospital, 6 mg of adenosine followed by 12 mg of adenosine were administered intravenously, without a change in her rhythm.On arrival to the emergency department, she was in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute (Figure, A), with an initial blood pressure of 108/77 mm Hg. She was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy (Figure, B), which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.50), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter; to convert to micrograms per milliliter, multiply by 1.0). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. She reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function.Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained on presentation (A) and immediately after electrical cardioversion (B).What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 30s with active bulimia who presented with a syncopal event after 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. She was found to be in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy, which settled to normal sinus rhythm. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. She reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function.

The most likely cause of the patient's wide complex tachycardia is an electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with bulimia, as they can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, and laxative abuse. They can also be caused by the use of diuretics, which are often used in the treatment of bulimia.

The patient's syncopal event is likely due to the hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, as these electrolyte imbalances can cause arrhythmias and hypotension. The elevated serum troponin is likely due to the patient's syncopal event, as it is a non-specific marker of myocardial injury.

The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function, which suggests that she does not have a structural heart disease.

The next step in the management of this patient is to correct her electrolyte imbalances. This can be done by administering potassium and magnesium replacement orally and intravenously. Once the patient's electrolyte imbalances are corrected, she should be monitored for recurrence of her arrhythmia. If the arrhythmia recurs, she may need to undergo further testing, such as coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or an invasive electrophysiology study.

Title: A Newborn With Stridor and Respiratory Distress Case is: A 0-day-old female neonate exhibited loud stridor and respiratory distress at birth. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, and prenatal ultrasonography results were normal. After spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks’ gestation, the neonate immediately developed tachypnea, severe retractions, barking cough, hoarse cry, and dusky appearance with oxygen desaturations to 60%, which required continuous positive airway pressure. Despite respiratory support, she was intubated within the first hour of life. The intubating clinician noted a large flesh-colored laryngeal mass and placed a size 3.5 uncuffed endotracheal tube. Ear, nose, and throat evaluation noted that the neonate was intubated and ventilating easily. No craniofacial abnormalities or obvious oral cavity, oropharyngeal, or neck masses were present. Chest radiography was obtained, and results were normal. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. Intraoperative evaluation revealed a large submucosal mass involving the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid that was soft and fluctuant on palpation (Figure 1).Direct laryngoscopy revealed a large mass involving the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: An Osseous Destructive Mass of the Infratemporal Fossa Case is: A 69-year-old man with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the left parotid gland had undergone left parotidectomy and modified neck dissection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy 12 years previously. Ten years later, he developed a second primary tumor in the hypopharynx requiring total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection. He presented with new-onset headaches, left ear pain, and persistent unsteadiness during the previous month. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, neurological deficits, or mastoid tenderness, and otoscopic examination results of the tympanic membrane appeared normal.Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed an enhancing lesion in the left infratemporal fossa (3.4 × 3.4 × 2.8 cm) abutting the cerebellum, and subsequent computed tomographic imaging of the head demonstrated osseous destruction of the left temporal bone extending along the left internal jugular vein (Figure, A). Fine-needle aspiration of the left mastoid showed atypical spindle cells. The patient underwent tumor excision with a left infratemporal approach. A large mass with rubbery texture was noted, extending into the jugular foramen and adherent to the dura mater without evidence of intradural invasion. The lower cranial nerves were identified, and the mass was resected to the external wall of the jugular bulb. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications or neurological deficits. Histopathologic assessment demonstrated myogenin-positive spindle cells with no tumor necrosis (Figure, B and C). In addition, the tumor expressed desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells. The tumor focally infiltrated into the fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone.A, Axial computed tomography of the head and neck demonstrating osseous destruction of the left temporal bone.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the left parotid gland and a second primary tumor in the hypopharynx. He presents with new-onset headaches, left ear pain, and persistent unsteadiness. Imaging studies show an enhancing lesion in the left infratemporal fossa with osseous destruction of the left temporal bone. Fine-needle aspiration of the left mastoid shows atypical spindle cells. Histopathologic assessment demonstrates myogenin-positive spindle cells with no tumor necrosis. In addition, the tumor expresses desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells. The tumor focally infiltrated into the fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone.

Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of spindle-shaped cells that express myogenin, a muscle-specific protein. The tumor can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the extremities, trunk, and head and neck.

The treatment for spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Patients with localized disease have a good chance of cure, while patients with metastatic disease have a poorer prognosis.

Title: Subcutaneous Nodule of the Midline Anterior Neck in an Infant Case is: A 6-month-old infant presented with a congenital papule that had been growing proportionally in size to the infant since birth (Figure 1). No associated pain or pruritus was noted, and the papule had never bled or produced other fluid or debris. The infant had no other congenital anomalies and had been meeting all major developmental milestones. On clinical examination, a superficial, white-yellow papule was identified on the anterior surface of the neck, situated at the midline superior to the sternal notch. It measured 6 mm in diameter and was not associated with overlying surface changes or evident discharge. Dermoscopy results showed scattered telangiectatic vessels over the papule, accentuated peripherally.A smooth, subcutaneous papule with a yellow tint is present above the suprasternal notch and exposed with retraction of skinfolds of the anterior neck.Ultrasonography was performed to further characterize the papule, and imaging results exhibited a superficial cutaneous lesion without evidence of tracking into deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue or fluid collection. Active nonintervention was recommended, but because of continued parental concern, the lesion was shaved off in clinic and sent for histopathologic evaluation to rule out malignant neoplasm and other morbid diagnoses.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is a thyroglossal duct cyst. This is a congenital anomaly that results from incomplete involution of the thyroglossal duct, which is a structure that helps to form the thyroid gland during fetal development. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most commonly located in the midline of the neck, just above the suprasternal notch. They are typically smooth, round, and fluctuant, and they may be associated with pain or tenderness. Ultrasonography can be used to confirm the diagnosis, and surgical excision is the treatment of choice.

Title: An Enlarging Right Neck Mass in a 25-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 25-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome with insulin resistance and a migraine disorder and reported experiencing 1 to 2 migraine episodes per week since early high school. She believed that the neck mass made these episodes worse than normal. The patient was otherwise previously healthy until she developed an upper respiratory infection. Her physician noted visible swelling in the right neck and clinically interpreted the finding as enlarged lymph nodes associated with the infection. After 2 weeks, the neck swelling persisted despite the resolution of other symptoms. She was subsequently treated with a course of antibiotics, which did not result in any improvement. The mass slowly enlarged over the next 6 months. The patient reported new symptoms, including waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size.Otolaryngologic examination findings were within normal limits except for a single, nontender, compressible right neck mass deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and extending into level V. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to presentation at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s otolaryngology clinic. The scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space (Figure, A). Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane (Figure, A). Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli (Figure, B and C).

Title: Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia With Sudden Vision Loss Case is: A 51-year-old man diagnosed as having acute promyelocytic leukemia, undergoing induction therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide that were started 2 weeks prior, presented with sudden loss of vision. Hospital course was complicated by neutropenic fever, receiving cefepime, acyclovir, vancomycin, and voriconazole for prophylaxis. Laboratory test results were remarkable for pancytopenia. On initial examination, his visual acuity was count fingers at 3 ft in both eyes. Intraocular pressures were 10 mm Hg OD and 11 mm Hg OS. Pupils were round and reactive without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Color plates were 1 of 8 OU, with 50% brightness desaturation in the right eye and no red desaturation. Extraocular movements were full. Slitlamp examination was negative for any signs of inflammation. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated bilateral choroidal effusions with diffuse serous retinal detachments (RD) involving the macula without vitritis as well as white centered intraretinal hemorrhages along peripapillary and superior and inferior arcade distributions in both eyes (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography demonstrated irregular inner retinal surface and subretinal fluid with septae with loss of the ellipsoid zone (Figure, B). Review of systems was positive for fever, tachycardia, odynophagia, productive cough with wheezing, and marked peripheral edema in upper extremities and negative for headache, nausea, vomiting, dysacusis, meningismus, or skin changes.Fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography 4 days from presentation demonstrating bilateral choroidal effusions with serous retinal detachment and white centered intraretinal hemorrhages.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a rare but potentially devastating complication of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment. PRES is characterized by headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual changes, and is thought to be caused by vasogenic edema in the brain. The diagnosis of PRES is made clinically, and there is no specific treatment. However, early recognition and treatment of PRES is important to prevent permanent neurological damage.

In this case, the patient's sudden loss of vision is concerning for PRES. The patient's history of APL and recent initiation of ATRA therapy are also risk factors for PRES. Therefore, the next step in management should be to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast, as well as a lumbar puncture. These tests will help to confirm the diagnosis of PRES and rule out other possible causes of the patient's visual changes.

If the diagnosis of PRES is confirmed, the patient should be treated with steroids. Steroids help to reduce vasogenic edema and improve neurological function. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of neurological deterioration.

Title: Subacute Vision Loss in a Patient With Limited Immune Dysfunction Case is: A 62-year-old man presented with subacute, painless vision loss in the right eye that developed over the course of 1 week. He had a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that was diagnosed 3 years earlier. The lymphoma was initially treated with chemotherapy, followed by a relapse that required additional chemotherapy and ultimately autologous bone marrow transplant 3 months before presentation. At the time of presentation, he was taking no immunosuppressive medications and was taking prophylactic acyclovir, 800 mg twice daily, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg) 3 times weekly.Snellen visual acuity measured 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measured 24 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect. Right eye examination results revealed 1+ anterior chamber inflammation, iris neovascularization, keratic precipitates, vitritis, and a granular necrotizing retinitis (Figure, A). Left eye examination results were unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye demonstrated panretinal occlusive vasculopathy with severe peripheral nonperfusion (Figure, B). His white blood cell count was moderately low at 3.1 kilos/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; reference range, 4.0-10.0 kilos/μL); a complete blood count and serum chemistry panel were otherwise normal. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing results were negative. An aqueous tap was performed and sent for culture and polymerase chain reaction.A, Wide-field fundus photograph demonstrating vitreous haze, vascular attenuation, macular cotton wool-spots, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages, and superior granular necrotizing retinitis.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that can affect the eyes. The lymphoma was initially treated with chemotherapy, followed by a relapse that required additional chemotherapy and ultimately autologous bone marrow transplant 3 months before presentation. At the time of presentation, he was taking no immunosuppressive medications and was taking prophylactic acyclovir, 800 mg twice daily, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg) 3 times weekly.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, a viral infection of the retina that is a common complication of immunosuppression. CMV retinitis is a sight-threatening condition, and prompt treatment is essential to prevent vision loss.

The first-line treatment for CMV retinitis is intravitreal foscarnet. Intravitreal foscarnet is a potent antiviral medication that is delivered directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. It is effective in treating CMV retinitis, and it is generally well-tolerated.

In addition to intravitreal foscarnet, the patient should also be started on intravenous acyclovir. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat a variety of viral infections, including CMV. It is generally well-tolerated, and it is effective in preventing the spread of CMV retinitis.

The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of progression of CMV retinitis, such as worsening vision, floaters, and pain in the eye. If the CMV retinitis progresses, the patient may need to undergo additional treatment, such as panretinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy.

Title: Atypical Conjunctival Lesion Associated With a Bladder Problem Case is: A white man in his 70s was referred for evaluation of a rapidly enlarging fleshy nodule of the right nasal conjunctiva. The patient noted redness, pain, and a foreign body sensation on his right eye for 2 weeks. The general ophthalmologist prescribed a 3-week course of oral prednisone, 20 mg/d, that reduced surrounding inflammation and pain, but the lesion did not change in appearance. The chest radiographic findings and blood work results were unremarkable. The lack of response to oral prednisone therapy led to suspicion of a possible malignant neoplasm, and the patient was referred for our opinion.The patient’s medical history was notable for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with transformation to large B-cell lymphoma that was treated with rituximab, adriamycin, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone chemotherapy 4 years earlier. Two years before referral, bladder cancer was diagnosed and was treated surgically and with multiple rounds of intravesical BCG immunotherapy. The most recent BCG treatment was 5 months before presentation to the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/40 OS. Anterior segment examination findings were remarkable for a limbal-based amelanotic lesion of the nasal conjunctiva measuring 5 mm in basal diameter and 1.5 mm thick and fed by large dilated conjunctival and episcleral vessels (Figure 1). Ocular ultrasonography revealed no intraocular involvement. The remainder of the eye examination was unremarkable.External photograph depicting a perilimbal erythematous conjunctival nodule with dilated episcleral vessels.Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesionObtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbitsWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with transformation to large B-cell lymphoma that was treated with rituximab, adriamycin, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone chemotherapy 4 years earlier. Two years before referral, bladder cancer was diagnosed and was treated surgically and with multiple rounds of intravesical BCG immunotherapy. The most recent BCG treatment was 5 months before presentation to the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The patient's current presentation is concerning for a malignant neoplasm. The lesion is rapidly enlarging, is not responsive to oral prednisone therapy, and is associated with a history of malignancy. The most likely diagnosis is a lymphomatous or leukemic infiltrate of the conjunctiva.

The next step in management is to perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and staging of the disease. If the lesion is malignant, further treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.

Title: Infectious Keratitis in a 23-Year-Old Patient With Netherton Syndrome Case is: A 23-year-old white man with Netherton syndrome, a skin condition of ichthyosiform erythroderma, presented to the clinic with what he described as “pressure behind the eye” and visual acuity “going in and out” in his left eye. The patient had an ocular history of herpes simplex (HSV) keratitis with a previous perforation of the right eye repaired with a patch graft, advanced open-angle glaucoma in the right eye, and ocular hypertension of the left eye, and he was receiving brimonidine 3 times a day in both eyes and acetazolamide, 250 mg, 3 times a day.On examination, his visual acuity without correction was 20/200 OD and 20/50 OS, with pinhole acuity measured at 20/80 OD and 20/40 OS. His intraocular pressure was 9 mm Hg OD and 42 mm Hg OS. An external examination revealed severe eczematous skin changes and thinning of the eyebrows and eyelashes. A slitlamp examination showed madarosis, mild eyelid edema, and conjunctival injection, which were greater in the left eye than the right eye. The right cornea had inferior pannus, scarring, and neovascularization. The left cornea revealed microcystic edema and central ulceration (Figure 1). The anterior chambers of both eyes were quiet. A fundus examination was notable for cup-disc ratios of 0.8 OD and 0.4 OS.Examination at presentation. External photograph of the right eye with neurotrophic cornea with neovascularization and scarring (A) and external photograph of the left eye with epithelial dendritic lesion with corneal edema (B).Bacterial cultures, a viral polymerase chain reaction, and potassium hydroxide preparations were obtained from the ulcer of the left cornea.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of herpes simplex keratitis and has a current corneal ulcer with positive bacterial cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. These findings are consistent with infectious keratitis, which is a serious eye infection that can lead to vision loss. The patient's visual acuity is already reduced in the left eye, and the infection could progress to perforation of the cornea and loss of vision in that eye. Therefore, it is important to start treatment with topical antibiotics as soon as possible. Oral antiviral therapy may also be necessary, depending on the results of the viral polymerase chain reaction test. Admission to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy is not necessary at this time, but may be required if the patient does not respond to oral therapy or if the infection worsens.

Title: Fever, Diarrhea, and Weight Loss in a Man With Inflammatory Polyarthritis Case is: A 61-year-old white man with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis presented with hand and wrist pain. Over 2 years, he was prescribed various therapies including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra; he experienced intermittent improvement in his joint pain but had persistently elevated levels of inflammatory markers. He continued to experience asymmetric small- and large-joint polyarthralgias and later developed intermittent fevers (temperatures up to 38.3°C [101°F]) along with a 50-lb (22.7-kg) unintentional weight loss over the course of a few months.On examination, there was subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Findings on cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level (7.7 mg/dL [73.3 nmol/L]). Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated. Over the next several months, he developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal.

The patient is a 61-year-old man with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis who has been treated with multiple therapies without significant improvement. He has developed fevers, diarrhea, and weight loss. On examination, he has subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Laboratory evaluation shows a normocytic anemia and an elevated C-reactive protein level. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy are unremarkable. Findings on further workup, including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis, are also unremarkable.

Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is enteropathy associated with autoimmune diseases (EAAD). EAAD is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the small intestine in association with an underlying autoimmune disease. The most common underlying autoimmune diseases associated with EAAD are rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The clinical presentation of EAAD is variable and may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and malabsorption. The diagnosis of EAAD is made by biopsy of the small intestine. The treatment of EAAD is directed at the underlying autoimmune disease. In addition, treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, or biologic agents may be necessary to control the inflammation of the small intestine.

In this patient, the most likely next step is to refer him to a nutritionist for education on a gluten-free diet. A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of treatment for celiac disease, which is a common cause of EAAD. A gluten-free diet is also effective in the treatment of other forms of EAAD, although it is not always clear whether it is necessary in all cases. In addition to a gluten-free diet, other treatments that may be beneficial in EAAD include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic agents.

Reasoning:

A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of treatment for celiac disease, which is a common cause of EAAD. A gluten-free diet is also effective in the treatment of other forms of EAAD, although it is not always clear whether it is necessary in all cases.

Title: Fever, Abdominal Pain, and Jaundice in a Pacific Islander Woman Case is: A 61-year-old woman with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with progressive right upper quadrant abdominal pain of 1 month’s duration. The pain was sharp, intermittent without radiation, and not exacerbated by eating. She had no subjective fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss. She had immigrated from Chuuk, Micronesia, to Hawaii 10 years ago and had not traveled overseas since. She denied alcohol use or contact with animals such as pigs.On examination, her temperature was 38.5°C (101.3°F); pulse rate, 104/min; blood pressure, 205/92 mm Hg; and respiratory rate, 33/min with normal saturation. Mild conjunctival icterus and a positive Murphy sign were noted. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 16.4 × 109/L (neutrophils, 87.4%; eosinophils, 0.5% [absolute count, 82/μL]); hemoglobin level, 14.9 g/dL; platelet count, 254 × 109/L; aspartate aminotransferase level, 514 U/L; alanine aminotransferase level, 236 U/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 208 IU/L; total bilirubin level, 2.5 mg/dL; direct bilirubin level, 1.1 mg/dL; and lipase level, 247 U/L. Results of serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed no cholecystitis or pancreatohepatobiliary abnormalities. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was notable for a linear filling defect within the common bile duct extending through the left hepatic duct (Figure, left panel). During endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), numerous worms were discovered within the biliary trees, with 1 visible outside the ampulla of Vater (Figure, right panel).Left, Findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with cholangitis due to Ascaris lumbricoides infection. Cholangitis is an inflammation of the bile ducts, which can be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including Ascaris lumbricoides. Ascaris lumbricoides is a nematode (roundworm) that is the most common human helminth infection worldwide. The worms can migrate from the intestines to the biliary tree, where they can cause obstruction and inflammation.

The patient's history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus increases her risk of developing cholangitis. Diabetes mellitus can lead to impaired immune function, which can make the patient more susceptible to infection. Additionally, diabetes mellitus can damage the blood vessels, which can increase the risk of bacterial infection.

The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with cholangitis. The white blood cell count is elevated, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions. The liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) are elevated, which is a specific finding of liver inflammation. The alkaline phosphatase is also elevated, which can be seen in a variety of liver diseases, including cholangitis.

The patient's imaging findings are consistent with cholangitis. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) shows a linear filling defect within the common bile duct, which is a classic finding of Ascaris lumbricoides infection. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows numerous worms within the biliary trees, which is a definitive diagnosis of Ascaris lumbricoides infection.

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging findings are all consistent with cholangitis due to Ascaris lumbricoides infection. The next step in management is to prescribe anthelminthic therapy. Anthelminthic therapy is the treatment of choice for Ascaris lumbricoides infection. The most commonly used anthelminthic is mebendazole. Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelminthic that is effective against a variety of nematodes, including Ascaris lumbricoides. Mebendazole is given orally and is generally well-tolerated. The most common side effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea.

The patient should be monitored for resolution of her symptoms. If her symptoms do not resolve after a course of anthelminthic therapy, she may need to be treated with a second course of therapy. Additionally, she should be monitored for complications of cholangitis, such as pancreatitis and secondary bacterial infection.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex labialis (HSVL). HSVL is a common viral infection that causes blisters on the lips and mouth. The virus is spread through contact with infected saliva or skin lesions. The most common symptom of HSVL is a cluster of painful blisters on the lips or mouth. The blisters may be accompanied by fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a tingling or burning sensation in the area before the blisters appear. HSVL is usually a self-limiting infection, meaning that the blisters will go away on their own within a few weeks. However, antiviral medications can be used to shorten the duration of the infection and reduce the severity of the symptoms.

**Answer:** The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to administer valacyclovir (A). Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective in treating HSVL. It is available in both oral and intravenous formulations. The oral formulation is typically given twice daily for 5 days. The intravenous formulation is typically given once daily for 7-10 days.

**Discontinuation of all cosmetics (B) is not necessary in the management of HSVL. Cosmetics are not known to be a risk factor for HSVL. In fact, some cosmetics may actually help to protect the skin from the virus.**

**Discontinuation of ibuprofen (C) is not necessary in the management of HSVL. Ibuprofen is not known to be a risk factor for HSVL. In fact, some studies have shown that ibuprofen may actually help to reduce the severity of the symptoms of HSVL.**

**Administration of antibiotics (D) is not necessary in the management of HSVL. HSVL is a viral infection, and antibiotics are not effective against viruses. In fact, the use of antibiotics in the treatment of HSVL can actually increase the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.**

The most likely diagnosis is **granuloma inguinale**. This is a chronic, granulomatous infection of the skin and lymphatics caused by the bacterium Klebsiella granulomatis. It is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, including Malawi. The characteristic clinical presentation is a painless, beefy red ulcer with rolled borders. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen, which shows granulomas with central necrosis and surrounding inflammation. The treatment of choice is oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin.

**Onchocerciasis** is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries, including Malawi. The disease is characterized by skin rashes, eye lesions, and lymphedema. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding microfilariae in the skin or eyes. The treatment of choice is ivermectin.

**Late cutaneous bilharziasis** is a chronic, granulomatous skin disease caused by infection with the trematode Schistosoma haematobium. It is most common in people who have had chronic urinary schistosomiasis. The characteristic clinical presentation is a pruritic, papular eruption on the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine. The treatment of choice is praziquantel.

**Periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis** is a rare, localized form of cutaneous tuberculosis that occurs around the mouth and nose. It is most common in people with HIV infection. The characteristic clinical presentation is a papulonodular eruption with central umbilication. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy specimen. The treatment of choice is isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

**Reasoning:**

The patient presented with a pruriginous, reddish nodule on the left earlobe. Histopathologic findings revealed mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone as well as the dilated vessel luminal, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall. These findings are consistent with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE).

ALHE is a rare, benign vascular proliferation that typically affects the head and neck region. It is characterized by the presence of small, red, papular or nodular lesions. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with pain, tenderness, or ulceration. Histopathologically, ALHE is characterized by the presence of a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, within the dermis and perivascular spaces.

The treatment of ALHE is generally not necessary, as the lesions are often self-limited. However, in some cases, treatment with topical or systemic corticosteroids may be necessary to control the symptoms.

Title: Pyogenic Brain Abscesses in a Patient With Digital Clubbing Case is: A 34-year-old man presented with headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week. He had had 2 episodes of seizures that were characterized by tonic head and eye deviation to the left, followed by a brief period of tonic-clonic activity of all 4 limbs and postictal confusion for 10 to 15 minutes. He denied a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting. He was a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker. He denied a history of drug addiction.On examination, he was confused. He had facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes. His chest and cardiovascular examination results were normal. He had ptosis in his right eye. The right eye was deviated laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy. His pupil size and pupillary light reactions were normal. He also had grade II papilledema. His motor and sensory examination results were normal; however, he had brisk deep-tendon jerks and extensor planter responses. There were no meningeal signs.His cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction (Figure, A). The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images.A, Cranial T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance image showing ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal lobes. B, Chest radiography showing a radiolucent nodular shadow in left middle lung field.His hemoglobin level was 19.3 grams per deciliter (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), his total leukocyte count was 13 500/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001), his hematocrit was 62.4% (to convert to a proportion of 1.0, multiply by 10), and his platelet count was 210 000/μL (to convert to cells × 109/L, multiply by 0.001).

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of headache, double vision, seizures, and altered consciousness is consistent with a diagnosis of pyogenic brain abscesses. The presence of facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes is suggestive of a right-to-left cardiac shunt, which could have led to the development of brain abscesses. The chest radiograph shows a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung, which could represent a lung abscess. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram did not show any evidence of congenital heart disease. The arterial blood gas test result showed an oxygen saturation level of 80%, which is consistent with hypoxemia. The blood cultures were found to be sterile, which makes it less likely that the patient has an infection with a pyogenic organism.

Answer: The most likely diagnosis is pyogenic brain abscesses secondary to a right-to-left cardiac shunt.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of pyogenic brain abscesses. The most common causes of pyogenic brain abscesses are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The patient's history of headache, double vision, and seizures for 1 month and altered consciousness for 1 week is consistent with the development of brain abscesses. The patient's facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes are non-specific findings that can be seen in a variety of conditions, including chronic liver disease, heart disease, and lung disease. The patient's chest and cardiovascular examination results were normal, which makes chronic liver disease, heart disease, and lung disease less likely. The patient's ptosis in his right eye, right eye deviation laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy, and grade II papilledema are all signs of increased intracranial pressure, which is consistent with the development of brain abscesses. The patient's motor and sensory examination results were normal, which makes a stroke less likely. The patient's cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction, which is consistent with the diagnosis of pyogenic brain abscesses. The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images, which is also consistent with the diagnosis of pyogenic brain abscesses. The patient's hemoglobin level was 19.3 grams per deciliter, his total leukocyte count was 13,500/μL, his hematocrit was 62.4%, and his platelet count was 210,000/μL. These laboratory findings are all within normal limits. The patient's liver and renal function test results were normal. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV was nonreactive. A radiograph of his chest showed a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram did not show any evidence of congenital heart disease. An arterial blood gas test result showed an oxygen saturation level of 80%. The patient's blood cultures were found to be sterile. These findings do not support a diagnosis of lung abscess, pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, or bronchogenic carcinoma.

The chest radiograph shows a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung, which could be a lung abscess. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram does not show any evidence of congenital heart disease, which would be a potential source of an embolic brain abscess. The arterial blood gas test result shows an oxygen saturation level of 80%, which is consistent with hypoxia. The blood cultures are found to be sterile, which is consistent with a pyogenic brain abscess.

Title: A Rare Form of Lipid Metabolic Encephalopathy Case is: A 27-year-old Asian man was found with painless masses of about 5.1 cm in diameter that appeared on both Achilles tendons 10 years ago. Two years prior, he had no obvious inducement and gradually developed indifference, glassy eyes, lethargy, and poor memory. One year prior, the patient’s personality changed dramatically, with notably decreased memory formation but intact short-term memory. He was short-tempered, irritable, hyperactive, and exhibited slight balance instability while walking. On admission, physical examination showed unstable balance while walking in a straight line, positive ankle clonus bilaterally, positive Babinski sign bilaterally, positive Chaddock sign bilaterally, positive Romberg sign, and painless lumps of about 8.2 cm in diameter in both Achilles tendons. Routine laboratory test results showed that the patient’s triglyceride level was elevated at 342.48 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0013 mg/dL; normal levels are considered to be 30.97-150.44 mg/dL). A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated multiple bilateral, symmetric abnormal signals in the genus of the internal capsules, posterior limbs of internal capsules, cerebral peduncles, pons, and cerebellar dentate nuclei (Figure, A). Genetic testing indicated a known pathogenic mutation c.1214G>A (p.Arg405Gln; Hom) in the CYP27A1 gene. An MRI of the ankle joints revealed an enlargement of the left Achilles tendon with abnormal signal, and the right Achilles tendon was circumscribed by a fusiform enlargement with abnormal signal (Figure, B).A, Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested multiple symmetrical abnormal signals (bilateral genus of internal capsule and posterior limbs of internal capsule, bilateral cerebral peduncles, pons, and cerebellar dentate nucleus).

An MRI of the ankle joints revealed an enlargement of the left Achilles tendon with abnormal signal, and the right Achilles tendon was circumscribed by a fusiform enlargement with abnormal signal.

The most likely diagnosis is cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CTX is a rare, inherited disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the brain, tendons, and other organs. The disease is caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, which encodes the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting cholesterol into bile acids, which are excreted in the bile. In CTX, the defective CYP27A1 gene leads to a build-up of cholesterol and other lipids in the body.

The clinical features of CTX vary depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disease. The most common symptoms include tendon xanthomas (fatty deposits on tendons), seizures, mental retardation, and vision problems. Other symptoms may include ataxia (loss of coordination), hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage).

There is no cure for CTX, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include medications to lower cholesterol levels, surgery to remove tendon xanthomas, and physical therapy to help with ataxia and other movement problems.

Title: New-Onset Heart Failure in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A man in his mid-60s with a history significant for hereditary spherocytosis, polycythemia vera, hemochromatosis, hypereosinophilia, and asymptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presented to the emergency department because of dyspnea. Over a 4-week period, he developed dyspnea with moderate levels of physical activity that were occasionally associated with brief episodes of lightheadedness. He also reported orthopnea but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or leg edema. There was no chest pain, palpitations, cough, fever, or hemoptysis. He had tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute with a normal oxygen saturation, temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. A soft (I/VI) systolic murmur with a brief diastolic component was appreciated over the apex. Jugular venous distension was present; there were no pulmonary rales, abdominal distention, or leg edema. Workup results demonstrated leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 39 800/μL [to convert to ×109 L, multiply by 0.001]; 15920/μL eosinophils [44%]), with a hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and a platelet count of 153 ×103/μL (to convert to ×109 L, multiply by 1). A basic metabolic panel yielded normal results and troponin was undetectable. His chest radiography results were suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion. The echocardiogram results demonstrated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no substantial wall motion abnormalities. There was an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared with the adjacent myocardium (Video). Representative frames of the echocardiogram are shown in Figure 1.Representative apical 4-chamber view in diastole (A) and systole (B) demonstrating an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared with the adjacent myocardium.What Would You Do Next? A: Endomyocardial biopsy , B: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , C: A whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan , D: Genetic testing for noncompaction. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a thin, noncompacted layer of myocardium in the left ventricle. The diagnosis is typically made with echocardiography, which shows the characteristic appearance of a "double chamber" left ventricle.

The patient's echocardiogram shows an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared with the adjacent myocardium. This is consistent with the diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

The next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRI is the most accurate test for diagnosing noncompaction cardiomyopathy. It can also provide information about the extent of the disease and the function of the left ventricle.

If the diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy is confirmed, the patient will need to be followed closely by a cardiologist. Treatment options include medications, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, heart transplant.

Title: Recurrent Vocal Fold Mass in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 45-year-old woman was referred to a tertiary care center for hoarseness. She had a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier at an outside institution, with benign pathology reported. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp (2-3 mm). She was sent for preoperative voice therapy, with plans for excision. However, her voice worsened with therapy, and she returned to the otolaryngology clinic after a few weeks. A larger, 6- to 7-mm, irregular, left vocal fold mass was noted. Preoperative imaging was nonspecific, revealing a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision (Figure, A). After the final pathology results were obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating room for cordectomy with negative margins.A, The left vocal fold lesion has a hemorrhagic exophytic mass that has prolapsed into the subglottis. B, Lesional spindled, fibroblastic-myofibroblastic, and inflammatory cells (both plasma cells and lymphocytes) appear in a myxoid background with abundant blood vessels.

Title: A Posterior Neck Mass in a 7-Month-Old Infant Case is: A full-term, 7-month-old male infant presented to an outpatient pediatric otolaryngology clinic with a firm, irregularly shaped posterior neck mass. He had been diagnosed prenatally with cerebellar hypoplasia, so a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was performed at 1 month of age. This study demonstrated an incidental solid, homogenous mass in the subcutaneous fat of the right occiput with irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature (Figure, A). On examination, the upper posterior neck mass was deep to palpation without overlying skin changes. The patient had no discomfort, and neck movement was not restricted.A, Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the neck without contrast. The arrowhead points to a 1.1-cm × 0.8-cm × 1.7-cm right occipital soft tissue mass with irregular borders and infiltration into the deep paraspinal musculature. B and C, Hematoxylin-eosin–stained images demonstrating cells with oval nuclei and multiple small nucleoli surrounded by a pale eosinophilic and slightly fibrillary stroma.At 7 months of age, the patient underwent ultrasonography to assess interval change of the lesion, which confirmed a 3.4-cm × 1.6-cm × 3.7-cm mass that had grown proportionally with the patient and was relatively avascular. Shortly thereafter, the mass was excised en bloc along with a cuff of adjacent posterior neck muscle and subcutaneous tissue. Grossly, the lesion was firm, round, and white in color with a smooth intact border but no discrete capsule. Histologic examination revealed cells with oval nuclei and multiple small nucleoli surrounded by a pale eosinophilic and slightly fibrillary stroma (Figure, B and C). Immunohistochemical studies were diffusely positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, and focally positive for S100, NeuN, and synaptophysin.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Lipoma , B: Rhabdomyosarcoma , C: Infantile hemangioma , D: Glial heterotopia. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 7-month-old male infant who presented with a firm, irregularly shaped posterior neck mass. The mass was deep to palpation without overlying skin changes. The patient had no discomfort, and neck movement was not restricted. A magnetic resonance imaging study of the neck demonstrated an incidental solid, homogenous mass in the subcutaneous fat of the right occiput with irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature.

The differential diagnosis for a posterior neck mass in a child includes lipoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, infantile hemangioma, and glial heterotopia. Lipomas are the most common soft tissue tumors in children, and they are typically benign. Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant tumors of skeletal muscle, and they are the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Infantile hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels, and they are the most common vascular tumor in children. Glial heterotopias are benign tumors of glial cells, and they are most commonly found in the brain.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of glial heterotopia. The mass is deep to palpation, which is a characteristic of glial heterotopias. The mass is also firm, which is another characteristic of glial heterotopias. The patient has no discomfort, and neck movement is not restricted, which are both reassuring features. The magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrates an incidental solid, homogenous mass in the subcutaneous fat of the right occiput with irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature. These findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of glial heterotopia.

The patient's age is also important to consider. Glial heterotopias are most commonly diagnosed in children under the age of 2 years. The patient in this case is 7 months old, which is within the typical age range for glial heterotopias.

The patient's imaging studies and clinical presentation are most consistent with a diagnosis of glial heterotopia. The patient's age is also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is glial heterotopia.

Her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 11 M5V4E2 on admission, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a right frontal epidural hematoma with a maximum thickness of 19 mm and a volume of 30 cm3 (Figure 1A). The hematoma was evacuated by neurosurgery, and her GCS improved to 14 postoperatively. On postoperative day 2, she developed isolated dysphagia and dysphonia. Laryngoscopic examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis (Figure 1B).A, Computed tomographic (CT) image of the head shows a right frontal epidural hematoma. B, Clinical laryngoscopic image at day 2 shows right vocal cord palsy. C and D, Computed tomographic images with contrast show a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex (yellow arrowheads), which causes acute compression of the recurrent nerve as it follows the course of the cranial accessory nerve then the vagus nerve.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of epilepsy and alcohol use disorder puts her at risk for cerebral venous thrombosis. The CT scan showed a right frontal epidural hematoma, which can cause compression of the cranial nerves, including the vagus nerve. The patient's development of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia on postoperative day 2 suggests that she has right vocal cord paralysis, which is a sign of vagus nerve dysfunction. The CT scan with contrast showed a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which is consistent with cerebral venous thrombosis.

Answer: B. Cerebral vein thrombosis

The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient's history of epilepsy and alcohol use disorder puts her at risk for cerebral venous thrombosis. The CT scan showed a right frontal epidural hematoma, which can cause compression of the cranial nerves, including the vagus nerve. The patient's development of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia on postoperative day 2 suggests that she has right vocal cord paralysis, which is a sign of vagus nerve dysfunction.

Title: A Painless Retroauricular Mass Case is: A 31-year-old Hispanic woman had a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The patient denied bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses. Her medical history included eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream. Otherwise, the patient had no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol.On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations was palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient had no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There was no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL  (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland (Figure, A).A, Axial T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance image of the head and neck. B, Lesional specimen of the excised mass (original magnification ×10).The excised mass was an enlarged, 2.2 × 1.5 × 2.2-cm lymph node with a smooth, pale core and no hemorrhage or necrosis.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 31-year-old Hispanic woman with a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The mass is nontender, mobile, and has superficial excoriations. There is no hearing deficit or fistula into the external auditory canal. There is no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy. Serologic studies reveal an elevated absolute eosinophil count and an eosinophilia percentage. The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland. The excised mass is an enlarged, 2.2 × 1.5 × 2.2-cm lymph node with a smooth, pale core and no hemorrhage or necrosis. The capsule is moderately thickened by collagen fibrosis with focal areas of interstitial fibrosis. Reactive follicular hyperplasia is present with prominent eosinophilia in the interfollicular areas and within follicles, forming eosinophilic microabscesses and follicular cysts. A few small and ill-defined granulomas are present. Results of Gomori methenamine silver and acid-fast stains are negative.

The most likely diagnosis is Kimura disease. Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder of lymph nodes and other tissues that is characterized by eosinophilia. It is more common in men than in women and typically affects people between the ages of 20 and 40. The cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The main symptoms of Kimura disease are lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, and organomegaly. The lymphadenopathy is usually asymmetric and involves the head and neck.

Title: Relapsing Optic Neuropathy and Multiple Cranial Neuropathies in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 55-year-old white woman presented with 1 week of decreased visual acuity and ache on abduction in the right eye. She had decreased right-sided hearing and tinnitus, a moderate right-sided frontal headache, and an unsteady gait. She did not have diplopia, facial numbness, or paresthesias. She had a history of stage IV breast cancer treated with letrozole after a mastectomy 5 years prior. On an initial examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS, with dyschromatopsia, relative afferent pupillary defect, and visual-field defects on the right side. Her extraocular movements were full. A dilated fundus examination demonstrated a pale right optic nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was reported to have normal results, but on review, we noted thickening and enhancement of both optic nerves (with the right eye larger than the left eye) (Figure 1A), cranial nerve III in the right eye, cranial nerve V bilaterally, the pituitary infundibulum, and the hypothalamus, as well as adjacent cavernous sinuses. Leptomeningeal thickening over the convexities of the anterior frontal lobes was also evident (Figure 1B). The patient’s cerebrospinal fluid contained a small population of polyclonal CD19+ B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. An extensive laboratory workup, including tests for HIV, antinuclear antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serum protein electrophoresis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complete blood cell count, antiganglioside antibodies, anti–myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, gave normal results.

**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of breast cancer and has presented with multiple relapses of optic neuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies. The initial MRI of the brain showed thickening and enhancement of both optic nerves, cranial nerve III in the right eye, cranial nerve V bilaterally, the pituitary infundibulum, and the hypothalamus, as well as adjacent cavernous sinuses. Leptomeningeal thickening over the convexities of the anterior frontal lobes was also evident. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid contained a small population of polyclonal CD19+ B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. An extensive laboratory workup, including tests for HIV, antinuclear antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, serum protein electrophoresis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complete blood cell count, antiganglioside antibodies, anti–myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, gave normal results. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax and a whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan revealed no abnormalities.

The patient's clinical course is consistent with a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). NMOSD is an autoimmune disorder that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. The most common presenting symptom is optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Other symptoms may include diplopia, nystagmus, facial numbness or weakness, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, ataxia, and seizures.

The diagnosis of NMOSD is based on clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. The most specific laboratory test for NMOSD is the presence of anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Imaging studies may show inflammation of the optic nerves and spinal cord.

The treatment of NMOSD is with corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Other medications that may be used include immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange.

In the case of the patient described above, the most likely next step in management would be to administer high-dose corticosteroids. This would help to reduce inflammation and improve her symptoms. Other treatment options, such as immunosuppressants or plasma exchange, could be considered if her symptoms do not improve with corticosteroids.

Title: Chronic Conjunctivitis in an Older Patient With Ptosis Case is: A 76-year-old white woman with a history of left corneal stem-cell deficiency and cataract presented for a second opinion of recurrent left upper eyelid blepharedema, ptosis, erythema, photophobia, mucopurulent discharge, and a feeling she described as a “knife in my left eye” over the past 4 years (Figure 1). Previous treatment included topical steroids, antibiotics, and serum tears, with temporary relief. However, she experienced recurrences of symptoms after therapy discontinuation. Additional treatment included weekly bandage contact lenses for many months, which made the left eye pain tolerable. A dacryocystogram of the left lacrimal system indicated partial dacryostenosis, but compression of the canaliculi and lacrimal sac did not exacerbate discharge. A prior computed tomography scan of the orbits and sinuses showed no abnormalities. Her visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/100 OS. Deep superior conjunctival fornices were noted in both eyes (Figure 1), and eversion of the left upper eyelid revealed a pseudomembrane of the tarsal conjunctiva. Cultures of the copious discharge demonstrated many gram-negative Serratia marcescens. She subsequently started treatment with topical prednisolone acetate, moxifloxacin, and systemic azithromycin.Patient presented with recurrent left eye ptosis, erythema, blepharedema, chronic discharge, and knifelike pain over the past 4 years (arrowhead).Two weeks after the initial consultation, the patient reported persistent but improved symptoms in the left eye. At this follow-up visit, her visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/200 OS.What Would You Do Next? A: Start treatment with systemic steroids , B: Perform a dacryocystorhinostomy , C: Sweep the superior fornix , D: Perform a canaliculotomy. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of chronic conjunctivitis that has been refractory to treatment with topical steroids, antibiotics, and serum tears. She also has a pseudomembrane of the tarsal conjunctiva, which is a sign of severe inflammation. The cultures of the discharge grew Serratia marcescens, which is a gram-negative bacteria that is often resistant to antibiotics. Given the patient's history, presentation, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic bacterial conjunctivitis caused by Serratia marcescens.

**Answer:** The most appropriate next step in management is to start treatment with systemic antibiotics. Topical antibiotics are not likely to be effective in this case, as the patient has already failed treatment with topical antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics are more likely to be effective in treating a deep-seated infection such as this. In addition, systemic antibiotics will help to prevent the spread of infection to other parts of the body.

A dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure that is used to drain the lacrimal sac. It is not indicated in this case, as the patient does not have any evidence of dacryocystitis.

A canaliculotomy is a surgical procedure that is used to open the canaliculi. It is not indicated in this case, as the patient does not have any evidence of canalicular obstruction.

Sweeping the superior fornix is a technique that is used to remove debris from the conjunctiva. It is not indicated in this case, as the patient does not have any evidence of conjunctival foreign body.

Title: A Black-Pigmented Eyelid Nodule in an African American Woman Case is: A 73-year-old African American woman was referred for the evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left upper eyelid margin of 6 weeks’ duration. The patient first noted an erythematous, tender swelling with yellow discharge, which later evolved to the pigmented mass. Her ocular history was unremarkable. Her medical history revealed hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.On examination, her visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS. There was a sausage-shaped, darkly pigmented (black), focally ulcerated nodule involving the medial upper eyelid margin and measuring 8 × 6 × 4 mm. Associated madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia were noted (Figure 1). The remainder of the anterior segment and a dilated fundus examination were unremarkable.A, The multilobular pigmented mass is noted along the superomedial upper eyelid margin.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a black-pigmented eyelid nodule with associated madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia. These findings are suspicious for a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor that can metastasize to distant organs. The most common treatment for malignant melanoma is surgical excision with wide margins. In this case, the lesion is located on the eyelid margin, which makes it difficult to achieve adequate margins with a simple excision. Therefore, the best treatment option is a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins. This will ensure that the entire tumor is removed with clear margins.

Title: A Patient With Psychiatric Illness and Multiple Hemorrhages Case is: A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension, psychosis, and recurrent venous thromboembolism was admitted to the emergency department with fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. At presentation, he was experiencing psychosis and being treated in an inpatient psychiatric ward. He was nonadherent with medications and denied drug and alcohol abuse.On examination, he appeared comfortable. His blood pressure was 150/67 mm Hg; heart rate, 77/min; temperature, 36.7°C (98.1°F); respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. On both lower extremities, there was peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura (Figure). The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed a normocytic anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.2 g/dL [reference, 13.5-17.5 g/dL]; mean corpuscular volume, 85 fL [reference, 80-100 fL]); normal platelet count (thrombocytes, 285 ×109/L [reference, 150-400 ×109/L]); and a mild leukopenia (leukocytes, 3.9 ×109 [reference, 4.3-10 ×109/L]). Folic acid level was low (3 nmol/L [reference, ≥5 nmol/L]) and vitamin B12 level was normal (478 pg/mL [reference, 193-982 pg/mL]). Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase were all within reference range.

**Reasoning:**

The patient has a history of psychosis, hypertension, and recurrent venous thromboembolism. He is currently experiencing fatigue, weakness, and arthralgias after an unexplained fall. He is also nonadherent with medications and denies drug and alcohol abuse. On examination, he has peripheral edema with widespread hematomas, scattered ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura. Laboratory tests show a normocytic anemia, normal platelet count, and a mild leukopenia. Folic acid level is low and vitamin B12 level is normal. Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, PT, APTT, INR, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase are all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head are negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a bleeding disorder. The most likely diagnosis is vitamin B12 deficiency-related megaloblastic anemia. This is supported by the patient's history of psychosis, hypertension, and recurrent venous thromboembolism, as well as his laboratory findings of a normocytic anemia, normal platelet count, and a mild leukopenia. The patient's folic acid level is low, which is consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. His vitamin B12 level is normal, which suggests that his anemia is not due to vitamin B12 deficiency.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order additional coagulation tests, such as thrombin time and platelet function assay. These tests will help to determine the specific nature of the patient's bleeding disorder. If the patient's coagulation tests are normal, then the next step is to order a bone marrow biopsy. This will help to rule out other causes of the patient's anemia, such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

Title: The Point-of-Care INR Test for Vitamin K Antagonist Monitoring Case is: A 59-year-old man who had been taking warfarin for 16 years for recurrent deep vein thrombosis and a left ventricular thrombosis presented to the anticoagulation management service for a follow-up visit. His warfarin had been managed via point-of-care (POC) testing for the past 4 years with a goal international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. On presentation, his POC INR was 3.7. He reported no extra warfarin doses, medication changes, dietary nonadherence, or bleeding. His warfarin dosage was 36 mg/wk (3 mg every Wednesday and Saturday and 6 mg all other days) for the past year. The Table shows the patient’s laboratory test results.Continue current warfarin dosing and perform a point-of-care (POC) international normalized ratio (INR) test in 1 week.Skip 2 doses of warfarin then resume current dosage and perform a POC INR test in 2 weeks.Skip 2 doses of warfarin, reduce weekly dosage by 10%, and perform a POC INR in 2 weeks.Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.What Would You Do Next? A: Continue current warfarin dosing and perform a point-of-care (POC) international normalized ratio (INR) test in 1 week. , B: Skip 2 doses of warfarin then resume current dosage and perform a POC INR test in 2 weeks. , C: Skip 2 doses of warfarin, reduce weekly dosage by 10%, and perform a POC INR in 2 weeks. , D: Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient's current INR is 3.7, which is above the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. This could be due to a number of factors, including:

* Taking too much warfarin
* Not taking enough warfarin
* Not eating a consistent diet
* Taking other medications that interact with warfarin
* Having a medical condition that affects the way the body metabolizes warfarin

It is important to determine the cause of the elevated INR before making any changes to the patient's medication or diet. The next step should be to perform a plasma INR test to confirm the results of the POC INR test. If the plasma INR is also elevated, the patient's warfarin dosage may need to be adjusted. If the plasma INR is normal, the patient may need to be evaluated for other causes of the elevated POC INR.

Title: A Man With Incessant Narrow Complex Tachycardia Case is: A 30-year-old man presented to the emergency department with palpitations and tachycardia. He had been experiencing sore throat, fevers, and myalgias for the past day. He became alarmed when he awoke from sleep with strong palpitations and a heart rate greater than 200/min documented on his smartwatch. He had similar symptoms 1 year ago and was diagnosed with and treated for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). A subsequent outpatient echocardiogram revealed a structurally normal heart; results of a follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) were also normal (Figure 1, top).Patient’s baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (top) and on presentation (bottom).On presentation to the emergency department, the patient’s temperature was 38.2°C; blood pressure, 125/67 mm Hg; and pulse, 241/min. Physical examination was notable for an erythematous oropharynx, tonsillar exudates, a tachycardic, regular heart rhythm, and clear lungs. An ECG was obtained (Figure 1, bottom). A modified Valsalva maneuver1 failed to convert the rhythm. He was subsequently given a series of doses of intravenous adenosine (6 mg, 12 mg, 12 mg), followed by direct current cardioversion at 200 J, which converted the rhythm to sinus for approximately 3 minutes. Intravenous metoprolol and intravenous diltiazem bolus and drip were then administered, which slowed the heart rate but did not terminate the arrhythmia. A rapid strep test result was positive, and he was given ampicillin.Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 JWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 30-year-old man with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) who presents with palpitations and tachycardia. He has a fever, sore throat, and myalgias. His physical examination is notable for an erythematous oropharynx, tonsillar exudates, a tachycardic, regular heart rhythm, and clear lungs. An ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia. A modified Valsalva maneuver failed to convert the rhythm. He was subsequently given a series of doses of intravenous adenosine (6 mg, 12 mg, 12 mg), followed by direct current cardioversion at 200 J, which converted the rhythm to sinus for approximately 3 minutes. Intravenous metoprolol and intravenous diltiazem bolus and drip were then administered, which slowed the heart rate but did not terminate the arrhythmia. A rapid strep test result was positive, and he was given ampicillin.

The next step in management is to repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J. This is because the patient's SVT has recurred despite treatment with adenosine, direct current cardioversion, and intravenous metoprolol and diltiazem. Repeat cardioversion is the most effective way to terminate SVT.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a middle-aged woman with a 4- to 5-year history of mildly pruritic coalescent yellowish papules around the umbilicus. She is obese and multiparous. Examination of the rest of the integument, systemic examination, and investigations including fundoscopy, electrocardiogram, and stool examination for occult blood revealed no significant abnormalities. Dermoscopic examination was performed (polarized mode, Dinolite) as shown in Figure 1B. We obtained a 4-mm punch biopsy from one of the papules for diagnostic clarification (Figure 1C).

The clinical presentation of the patient is most consistent with periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is a rare, inherited disorder of connective tissue characterized by the deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. The most common clinical manifestation of PXE is the development of yellowish papules and plaques on the skin, particularly around the umbilicus. These lesions may be pruritic and can coalesce to form larger plaques. The skin lesions of PXE are typically non-tender and do not ulcerate.

Dermoscopic examination of PXE lesions typically shows characteristic features, including curvilinear brown pigment lines, accentuation of the normal pigmentary network, and absence of follicular plugging or linear vessels. Histopathologic examination of PXE lesions shows characteristic findings, including clumped eosinophilic elastic fibers in the middermis.

The patient's history, physical examination, dermoscopic findings, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of PXE.

Title: Orofacial Dyskinesia in a Young Man Case is: A 30-year-old man had involuntary orofaciolingual movements for 7 years and unsteady gait for 2 months. At age 23 years, he began experiencing involuntary orofaciolingual movements and vocalizations. At age 27 years, he developed dysphagia, dysarthria, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. This oral dyskinesias worsened while eating. However, a handkerchief in the mouth markedly reduced involuntary tongue-biting and mouth movements. No neuropsychiatric symptoms or seizures were exhibited.Neurological examination results revealed mild cognitive decline, with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 18/30. Orofacial dyskinesia (Video 1), involuntary vocalizations, and mild dysarthria were exhibited. His muscle strength and tone were normal, but his deep reflexes were diminished or absent. The patient’s sensory and coordination examination results were unremarkable, and bilateral Babinski signs were negative. The patient’s gait was mildly wide based (Video 2). Fundus examination results were normal. Laboratory examination results, including blood electrolytes and lactate, liver, kidney, and thyroid function, antinuclear antibodies, ceruloplasmin levels, and vitamin A and E levels were normal. Routine and biochemical examination results, oligonucleotide band, antibodies against antiaquaporin 4, and autoimmune encephalitis-related antibodies (ie, N-methyl-d-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic, γ-aminobutyric acid-B, leucine-rick glioma inactivated 1, contactin-associated protein 2, and IgLON5) of cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Creatine kinase (CK) levels were significantly elevated at 2304 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167; normal range, 25-200 U/L). Low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels were slightly decreased at 61 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0357; normal range, 80-119 mg/dL) and 58 mg/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01; normal range, 66-133 mg/dL), respectively. Acanthocytes were found in the blood smear via Wright staining (Figure, A). Electrophysiological examination results revealed reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential of bilateral median and ulnar nerves. Electromyogram results showed neurogenic damage in lower limb muscles. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results revealed a marked bilateral caudate head atrophy (Figure, B).A, Acanthocytes in the peripheral blood smear shown via Wright staining (original magnification, ×1000).

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presented with a 7-year history of involuntary orofacial movements, which worsened over time. He also developed dysphagia, dysarthria, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. These symptoms are consistent with chorea, a type of involuntary movement disorder. The patient's gait was also mildly wide based, which is another sign of chorea.

The patient's neurological examination revealed mild cognitive decline, orofaciolingual movements, involuntary vocalizations, and mild dysarthria. His muscle strength and tone were normal, but his deep reflexes were diminished or absent. The patient's sensory and coordination examination results were unremarkable, and bilateral Babinski signs were negative. These findings are consistent with a movement disorder affecting the basal ganglia, a group of brain structures that are involved in movement control.

The patient's laboratory examination results were unremarkable. Routine and biochemical examination results, oligonucleotide band, antibodies against antiaquaporin 4, and autoimmune encephalitis-related antibodies (ie, N-methyl-d-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic, γ-aminobutyric acid-B, leucine-rick glioma inactivated 1, contactin-associated protein 2, and IgLON5) of cerebrospinal fluid were normal. These findings suggest that the patient's symptoms are not caused by an infection, autoimmune disease, or other systemic disorder.

The patient's CK levels were significantly elevated at 2304 U/L. This finding is consistent with muscle damage, which can be caused by a number of conditions, including chorea.

The patient's blood smear showed acanthocytes, which are abnormal red blood cells that have spiky projections on their surface. Acanthocytes are a characteristic finding in chorea-acanthocytosis.

The patient's electrophysiological examination results revealed reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential of bilateral median and ulnar nerves. Electromyogram results showed neurogenic damage in lower limb muscles. These findings are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which can be a complication of chorea-acanthocytosis.

The patient's cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results revealed a marked bilateral caudate head atrophy. The caudate nucleus is a brain structure that is involved in movement control. Atrophy of the caudate nucleus is a characteristic finding in chorea-acanthocytosis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is chorea-acanthocytosis.

Title: Recurrent Stroke in a Man With a Pacemaker Case is: A 65-year-old man presented with an acute onset of aphasia for which he received intravenous thrombolysis with substantial improvement. This was the second stroke he had in 6 months. The patient’s other medical problems included well-controlled hypertension and diabetes. Seven months before this admission, a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted at an outside institution for sick sinus syndrome. Device interrogation revealed no atrial fibrillation and normal lead parameters. Electrocardiogram results showed atrial pacing with capture and intrinsic ventricular conduction. Magnetic resonance angiography results of carotid, vertebral, and cerebral arteries were normal. Chest radiography was taken (Figure 1).Chest radiography. A, In the posterior-anterior projection, the ventricular lead curves more superiorly than usual and lacks the expected indentation as it traverses the tricuspid valve. B, Lateral projection demonstrates a posterior orientation of the lead that is suspicious for left ventricular placement.What Would You Do Next? A: Transthoracic echocardiogram , B: Screen for thrombophilia , C: Prolonged Holter monitoring , D: Take serial blood cultures. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of two strokes in 6 months, the most recent of which occurred despite intravenous thrombolysis. He has a dual-chamber pacemaker that was implanted 7 months ago. Chest radiography shows that the ventricular lead curves more superiorly than usual and lacks the expected indentation as it traverses the tricuspid valve. This suggests that the lead may be in the left ventricle, rather than the right ventricle. A left ventricular lead is a potential source of embolism, which could explain the patient's strokes.

Answer: The next step in management is to obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram to confirm the position of the ventricular lead. If the lead is in the left ventricle, it should be removed. The patient should also be screened for thrombophilia and may need to be anticoagulated.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate in this case. A prolonged Holter monitor is not likely to be helpful, as the patient's strokes were not caused by arrhythmia. Serial blood cultures are not necessary, as there is no evidence of infection.

Answer not available
**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of two strokes in 6 months, the most recent of which was treated with intravenous thrombolysis. He also has a dual-chamber pacemaker that was implanted 7 months ago. The chest radiograph shows that the ventricular lead is curved more superiorly than usual and lacks the expected indentation as it traverses the tricuspid valve. This is suspicious for left ventricular placement. Left ventricular lead placement is a known risk factor for thromboembolism, which could explain the patient's strokes. Therefore, the next step in management should be to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for left ventricular lead placement and to rule out other causes of the patient's strokes.

Title: Unusual Vitreous Opacity in a Chinese Patient Case is: A Chinese woman had painless, gradually declined vision for 2 years without redness. She had a medical history of vomiting and emaciation in her early 40s. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) had been done for her left eye owing to vitreous opacity half a year prior. She claimed that her younger brother died of liver cancer and her mother had lost vision because of vitreous hemorrhage and glaucoma. She denied any history of systemic disorders.On initial examination, best-corrected visual acuity was measured at 0.1 (20/200) OU. Intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Her anterior segment examination results were within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated bilateral vitreous opacity without cells (Figure). The peripheral residual vitreous cortex in the left eye was as cloudy as the cortex in the right eye. Fundus was not visible in the right eye and was normal in the left eye. A bilateral ocular ultrasonography showed normal results except for vitreous opacity. The patient weighed 37.0 kg and was 155 cm tall. Her blood pressure was 113/70 mm Hg. Mild anemia (hemoglobin level 10.5 g/dL vs a normal range of 11.0-15.0 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) was found in routine blood test results. Liver and renal functions were normal according to serum test results. The results of an electronic cardiogram were negative.Mosaic 9-field 50° fundus photography showed a uniform, glassy, woollike appearance of the vitreous in the right eye (A) and peripheral vitreous opacity in the left after pars plana virectomy (B).Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical testWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of vomiting and emaciation in her early 40s, which could be a sign of systemic illness. She also has a family history of liver cancer and vitreous hemorrhage. The bilateral vitreous opacity without cells is unusual and could be a sign of a systemic disorder. Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical test would be the best next step to determine the cause of the vitreous opacity and to rule out any systemic disorders.

Answer:
A. Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical test

The patient has a history of vomiting and emaciation in her early 40s, which could be a sign of systemic illness. She also has a family history of liver cancer and vitreous hemorrhage. The bilateral vitreous opacity without cells is unusual and could be a sign of a systemic disorder. Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical test would be the best next step to determine the cause of the vitreous opacity and to rule out any systemic disorders.

PPV plus pathological examination plus genetic test would be too invasive and unnecessary at this stage. Abdominal ultrasonography would not be able to provide any information about the cause of the vitreous opacity. Follow-up would be appropriate after the aqueous humor biopsy has been performed.

Title: An Orbital Lesion Diagnosed on Routine Fundus Examination Case is: A man in his 80s with pseudophakia presented for routine follow-up of an elevated choroidal nevus in his right eye. His medical history was notable for stage III non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma in the hilar and axillary nodes, which was asymptomatic and actively monitored by oncology, prostate cancer treated surgically that was in remission, and atrial fibrillation managed with medication (digoxin and warfarin). The choroidal nevus had been observed for the past 2 years; ultrasonography from 2 years prior revealed dimensions of 1.9 (height) × 9.3 (base) mm with medium internal reflectivity. There were no other concerning features noted, such as orange pigment or associated subretinal fluid.At presentation, the patient was asymptomatic with no diplopia, pain, constitutional symptoms, or blurred vision. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU. Pupils were reactive without a relative afferent pupillary defect, extraocular motility was full, and intraocular pressures were normal. His slitlamp and fundus examination results were unremarkable aside from the choroidal nevus in his right eye, which appeared similar to previous examinations (Figure 1A). Proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, conjunctival injection, and strabismus were notably absent. However, a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation was noted on B-scan ultrasonography (Figure 1B).A, Color fundus photography of the right eye illustrates a hyperpigmented choroidal nevus (arrowhead) in the macula. B, B-scan ultrasonography demonstrates a large hypoechoic cavity posterior to the globe (arrowhead) causing deformity of the globe wall.Monitor the patient with follow-up in 6 monthsWhat Would You Do Next? A: Perform fluorescein angiography , B: Obtain orbital imaging , C: Recommend a liver biopsy , D: Monitor the patient with follow-up in 6 months. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of stage III non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma, prostate cancer, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently asymptomatic with no diplopia, pain, constitutional symptoms, or blurred vision. His best-corrected visual acuity is 20/30 OU. Pupils are reactive without a relative afferent pupillary defect, extraocular motility is full, and intraocular pressures are normal. His slitlamp and fundus examination results were unremarkable aside from the choroidal nevus in his right eye, which appeared similar to previous examinations. Proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, conjunctival injection, and strabismus were notably absent. However, a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation was noted on B-scan ultrasonography.

The most likely diagnosis is a choroidal metastasis from the patient's non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma. The choroidal nevus is a possible incidental finding, but the new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity is concerning for metastasis.

The next step in management is to obtain orbital imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to confirm the diagnosis of a choroidal metastasis. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient will need to be referred to an oncologist for further management.

Title: An Amelanotic Choroidal Mass in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with blurry vision in her right eye for a duration of 2 weeks. Her visual acuity with correction was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination of the right eye was notable for an amelanotic choroidal mass with overlying subretinal fluid (Figure 1A). Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye were unremarkable. Results of fluorescein angiographic imaging of the right eye showed late leakage corresponding to the choroidal mass; the left eye was unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated a choroidal mass with an irregular surface contour and a mild overlying vitreous cell. On B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye, a superotemporal choroidal mass with an irregular surface contour and medium internal reflectivity was observed (Figure 1B). On further questioning, the patient reported a 9 pack-year smoking history. She had no known history of malignant conditions. She denied recent fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, and travel to foreign countries, and she was otherwise feeling well.A, Color fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates a large, solitary amelanotic choroidal mass (arrowheads) with overlying subretinal fluid. B, B-scan ultrasonographic image of the right eye shows an irregularly contoured choroidal mass (white arrowhead) and fluid in the Tenon space (open arrowhead).Investigate for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis; if negative, start treatment with steroidsRefer the patient to a primary care physician for a metastatic workupWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: A Patient With Widespread Painful Purpura Case is: A 62-year-old woman with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma noticed small, asymptomatic, purpuric patches on her right buttock and bilateral lower extremities. This was accompanied by fever, night sweats, and fatigue. She was found to have clinical and radiologic progression of her lymphoma and began receiving R-CHOP (rituximab + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin hydrochloride + vincristine [Oncovin] + prednisone) chemotherapy. Her purpuric patches improved initially after the first cycle of chemotherapy; however, in the weeks before the second cycle, they recurred more extensively, involving her right cheek and bilateral ears, arms, and legs. This time she also experienced pain in those areas as well as lower extremity edema.On presentation to the outpatient infusion suite, she appeared well, and her temperature was 37°C (98.6°F); heart rate, 91/min; blood pressure, 114/58 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18/min; and blood oxygen saturation, 98%. Diffuse, symmetric patches and soft, thin plaques of retiform purpura with minimally erythematous borders covered her extremities and acral surfaces, some with overlying bullae (Figure 1). A complete blood cell count showed an elevated white blood cell count (18 860/μL with 13% neutrophils, 43% lymphocytes, 9% monocytes, 33% others); hemoglobin, 7.2 g/dL; hematocrit, 21.8%; and platelet count, 142 ×103/μL.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma who presented with widespread painful purpura. She was found to have clinical and radiologic progression of her lymphoma and began receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy. Her purpuric patches improved initially after the first cycle of chemotherapy; however, in the weeks before the second cycle, they recurred more extensively, involving her right cheek and bilateral ears, arms, and legs. This time she also experienced pain in those areas as well as lower extremity edema.

The differential diagnosis for widespread painful purpura includes infection, coagulopathy, vasculitis, and malignancy. In this case, the patient's history of lymphoma and the fact that her purpura recurred after the first cycle of chemotherapy suggest that the purpura may be due to her malignancy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to determine whether she has an infection. Empirical intravenous antibiotics should be administered to patients with widespread painful purpura who are at risk for infection, such as those who have a fever or who are immunocompromised.

In addition to antibiotics, the patient should also be evaluated for a coagulopathy. Coagulopathies can occur in patients with lymphoma, and they can lead to purpura. The patient's coagulation studies should be checked, and she may need to be given blood products or other medications to correct her coagulopathy.

The patient should also be evaluated for vasculitis. Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels, and it can lead to purpura. The patient's skin biopsy should be checked for evidence of vasculitis.

Finally, the patient should be evaluated for malignancy. Malignancy is a common cause of widespread painful purpura. The patient's lymphoma should be treated with chemotherapy, and she should be monitored for signs of disease progression.

Answer:
The correct answer is A. Administer empirical intravenous antibiotics.

The patient is at risk for infection due to her fever and her immunocompromised state. Empirical intravenous antibiotics should be administered to patients with widespread painful purpura who are at risk for infection.

Title: Numerous Pink-Purple Papules in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A man in his 50s was referred to the dermatology clinic with a diagnosis of granuloma annulare made on the basis of prior skin biopsy results. He had been treated by a rheumatologist for polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints, as well as fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Examination revealed numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms (Figure, A) and legs. No lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient reported a 5- to 7-kg weight loss without fever or sweats. His pulmonary and joint symptoms were relieved by daily oral prednisone and flared with taper below 10 mg. Other medications prescribed included hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg, daily for 18 months and weekly adalimumab injections for 7 months, without improvement.A, Pink-purple papules on the extensor surface of the arms. B, Biopsy results show a nodular to diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate (hematoxylin-eosin). C, Admixed atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes with numerous histiocytes are present. D, Biopsy results show low CD4 signal and robust CD8 signal (magnification ×20).Pulmonary function testing revealed mild restrictive disease with decreased forced vital capacity and total lung capacity. Results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel; hemoglobin A1c; viral and rheumatologic panels, including HIV blood tests; chest radiograph; high-resolution chest computed tomographic scan; echocardiography; endoscopic studies; hand radiographs; and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal or otherwise unremarkable. The results of lesional skin biopsies obtained from multiple involved sites initially revealed nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis before a diagnostic biopsy was performed (Figure, B, C, and D).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , B: Granuloma annulare , C: Small-vessel vasculitis , D: Sarcoidosis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient is a middle-aged man with a history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and multiple pink-purple papules on the trunk and extremities. The pulmonary function testing revealed mild restrictive disease with decreased forced vital capacity and total lung capacity. The results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1c, viral and rheumatologic panels, including HIV blood tests, chest radiograph, high-resolution chest computed tomographic scan, echocardiography, endoscopic studies, hand radiographs, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal or otherwise unremarkable. The results of lesional skin biopsies obtained from multiple involved sites initially revealed nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis before a diagnostic biopsy was performed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, granuloma annulare, small-vessel vasculitis, and sarcoidosis. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the skin. It is characterized by the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the skin. Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small, round, inflammatory lesions. Small-vessel vasculitis is a group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation and damage to small blood vessels. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ in the body, but it most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and multiple pink-purple papules on the trunk and extremities are all consistent with sarcoidosis. The pulmonary function testing results, which showed mild restrictive disease with decreased forced vital capacity and total lung capacity, are also consistent with sarcoidosis. The results of the lesional skin biopsies, which initially revealed nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis before a diagnostic biopsy was performed, are also consistent with sarcoidosis.

The other possible diagnoses, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, granuloma annulare, and small-vessel vasculitis, are less likely in this patient. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare disease, and the patient does not have any of the classic features of this disease, such as a skin rash that is associated with itching, pain, or bleeding. Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition that is usually not associated with systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, or joint pain. Small-vessel vasculitis is a group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation and damage to small blood vessels. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with any of the specific types of small-vessel vasculitis, such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura or Wegener's granulomatosis.

In conclusion, the patient's most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with sarcoidosis, and the results of the lesional skin biopsies are also consistent with sarcoidosis. The other possible diagnoses, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, granuloma annulare, and small-vessel vasculitis, are less likely in this patient.

The patient is a girl in her teens who presents with asymptomatic, punctate, keratotic papules localized to the right palm and right third proximal finger that have been present since age 2 years. Prior treatments, including cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, and 40% salicylic acid, have resulted in partial improvement but never complete clearance. The physical examination reveals grouped and circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core. A 4-mm punch biopsy from a papule on the palm was performed, which revealed dilated follicular infundibula with keratinous cores and absent hair shafts.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathology, the most likely diagnosis is porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (POEDN). POEDN is a rare, benign, developmental anomaly of the eccrine sweat glands that is characterized by the presence of dilated follicular infundibula with keratinous cores and absent hair shafts. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and present as grouped, dome-shaped, skin-colored papules with a central punctate dark core. The lesions are most commonly found on the palms and soles, but can also occur on the face, neck, and extremities. There is no known cure for POEDN, but the lesions can be treated with cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, or 40% salicylic acid.

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of remote coronary artery bypass grafting and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent. He was discharged and prescribed ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily, in addition to his home regimen of aspirin and metoprolol tartrate. Three months later, he experienced worsening exertional dyspnea and had multiple episodes of syncope. He had no history of syncopal episodes or arrhythmias. His baseline transthoracic echocardiogram results demonstrated normal systolic function and no significant valvular disease. Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring results showed 31 episodes of high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block (AVB), with ventricular pauses ranging from 3.0 to 13.0 seconds occurring during the day and at night (Figure 1). Among them, 4 episodes were associated with presyncope.

The most likely cause of the patient's syncope is high-grade AVB. Metoprolol tartrate is a beta-blocker that can slow the heart rate and worsen AV block. Therefore, the first step in management is to discontinue metoprolol tartrate and repeat the ambulatory ECG. If the patient continues to have episodes of AVB, an implantable pacemaker may be necessary.

Title: Neck Mass in a Newborn With 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Case is: An 11-day-old boy with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor present at birth. The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but he had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. He had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure, A, B).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is an 11-day-old boy with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and unilateral renal agenesis. He presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor present at birth. The patient did not require positive pressure or intubation, but he had intermittent stridor associated with desaturations. He had feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. On physical examination, the newborn had facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a cystic lesion consistent with a vallecular cyst. A modified barium swallow study demonstrated laryngeal penetration and aspiration of thin and nectar-thick liquids. A diffuse, soft, palpable mass was present along the right neck.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, with a mildly hyperintense signal relative to muscle on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and associated restricted diffusion. The mass was largest on the right side, with convex borders, mild superior displacement of the right parotid gland, and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. The T2-weighted MRI also demonstrated a hyperintense, nonenhancing lesion within the base of the tongue consistent with a vallecular cyst. The thyroid appeared normal and in its expected location, but no thymus was present in the mediastinum. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the vallecular cyst, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right neck mass was performed for cytopathological analysis.

The biopsy results revealed a polymorphic population of lymphocytes, fibroadipose tissue, and a concentric island of squamous cells with central keratinization. The reference specimen from a study set of the tissue shown in panel C demonstrates islands of squamous cells in a background of small mature lymphocytes.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is **Ectopic thymus**. Ectopic thymus is a rare condition in which thymic tissue is found in an abnormal location, such as the neck. It is most commonly associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, as in this case. The clinical presentation of ectopic thymus can vary depending on the size and location of the ectopic thymus. In some cases, it may be asymptomatic. In other cases, it may cause symptoms such as neck mass, stridor, dysphagia, and respiratory distress. The diagnosis of ectopic thymus is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy results. The treatment of ectopic thymus depends on the size and location of the ectopic thymus, as well as the patient's symptoms. In some cases, the ectopic thymus may be managed conservatively with observation. In other cases, the ectopic thymus may need to be surgically removed.

**Answer:**
C. Ectopic thymus

Title: A Woman With Bilateral Retinal Detachments Case is: A 33-year-old otherwise healthy black woman presented to the emergency department for evaluation of blurry vision in both eyes. She had no relevant medical, family, or ocular history. There was no history of trauma or ocular surgery. One month prior to presentation, she had developed fevers, chills, and coughing. After several days, she had developed redness, pain, photophobia, and blurry vision in her left eye, and she had subsequently developed similar symptoms in her right eye. On presentation, her visual acuity was counting fingers OU. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OU. A slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival redness, 2+ anterior chamber cell, and flare in both eyes, as well as mild posterior synechiae. The cornea was clear without keratic precipitates, and there were no iris nodules. Pigment was present on the anterior lens capsule. A fundus examination demonstrated a moderate amount of vitreous cell, hyperemia and edema of the optic disc, and retinal detachments in both eyes (Figure). The detachments were inferior and shifted with the patient’s head position, suggesting serous detachments. Findings were similar bilaterally. A B-scan ultrasonographic test demonstrated bullous retinal detachments and diffusely thickened choroid.Fundus photograph of the left eye, demonstrating optic disc edema (arrowhead) and retinal detachment (asterisk).Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiographyA pars plana vitrectomy with a chorioretinal biopsyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has bilateral retinal detachments, which are a surgical emergency. The goal of treatment is to reattach the retina to the back of the eye as soon as possible. There are several different surgical options available, but the most common is a pars plana vitrectomy. This procedure involves removing the vitreous humor, the clear gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye, and replacing it with a gas bubble. The gas bubble helps to push the retina back into place. In some cases, a chorioretinal biopsy may also be necessary. This procedure involves removing a small piece of tissue from the choroid, the layer of tissue that lies between the retina and the sclera, the white of the eye. The tissue is then sent to a laboratory for testing to determine the cause of the retinal detachment.

Answer: D. A pars plana vitrectomy with a chorioretinal biopsy.

Title: Bilateral Limbus-Sparing Conjunctivitis in a Boy With Rash and Pneumonia Case is: An adolescent boy presented to the hospital with bilateral eye redness, an erythematous chest rash, lip blistering, and worsening sore throat for 2 days while undergoing a 10-day outpatient treatment course of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for community-acquired pneumonia. He complained of a cough, sore throat, and ocular itching. He denied prior ocular history and reported no visual changes. He had no significant medical history aside from documented allergies to β-lactam, macrolide, and cephalosporin antibiotics resulting in rashes, angioedema, and hives.The patient was febrile on admission, and results from chest radiography were consistent with pneumonia. Bedside ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral limbus-sparing conjunctival hyperemia that blanched minimally with phenylephrine, bilateral nasal and temporal conjunctival epithelial ulcerations, and inferior forniceal pseudomembranes (Figure, A). There were no symblephara or eyelid margin defects. Examination of the face revealed erosions with hemorrhagic crusts on the lip mucosa (Figure, B) but no associated cutaneous lesions or desquamation. Findings from the remainder of the ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examination, were unremarkable.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient in this case presents with bilateral limbus-sparing conjunctivitis, an erythematous chest rash, lip blistering, and worsening sore throat. He has a history of allergies to β-lactam, macrolide, and cephalosporin antibiotics. The most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe adverse drug reaction characterized by a rash, mucosal lesions, and fever.

The treatment for SJS is to discontinue the offending medication and provide supportive care. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation, but they are not always effective. In severe cases, skin grafting may be necessary.

In this case, the patient should be advised to discontinue the antibiotics he is taking. He should also be seen by a dermatologist to rule out other possible causes of his rash. If the rash is diagnosed as SJS, he will need to be hospitalized for supportive care.

**Answer:**

D. Discontinue antibiotics and avoid all medications associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Title: An 18-Month-Old With a White Optic Nerve Head Mass Case is: An 18-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history was referred to ocular oncology from pediatric ophthalmology for an intraocular mass near the optic nerve. Her parents noticed the left eye turning out for the past year. On examination, she fixed and followed with her right eye but not with the left, with 5.0-diopter exophoria at near in the left eye. Penlight examination results showed left leukocoria. Intraocular pressure and motility were normal bilaterally. On subsequent examination under anesthesia, the left optic nerve was obscured by a whitish mass. While the optic nerve itself was obscured, a pigmented crescent could be seen surrounding it (Figure, A). Ultrasonography results demonstrated an elevated retinal mass overlying an excavated optic nerve head. A small focus of hyperechogenicity was noted at the optic nerve head, consistent with calcium (Figure, B). Fluorescein angiography results demonstrated staining of the central whitish mass, which was obscuring the underlying retinal vessels.

Fluorescein angiography results demonstrated staining of the central whitish mass, which was obscuring the underlying retinal vessels. On fluorescein angiography results, no vessels were seen within the central whitish mass itself.

The differential diagnosis for an intraocular mass in a child includes retinoblastoma, medulloepithelioma, astrocytoma, and lymphoma. Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children, accounting for approximately 3% of all childhood cancers. It is a genetically inherited tumor, with most cases caused by a mutation in the RB1 gene. Medulloepithelioma is a rare malignant tumor of the ciliary epithelium. It is often associated with the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene. Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that can occur in the eye. It is usually a low-grade tumor, but it can sometimes be high-grade. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It can occur in the eye, but it is rare.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain an orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and a brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor. If the MRI shows that the tumor has invaded the optic nerve or the brain, then chemotherapy may be necessary. If the tumor has not invaded the optic nerve or the brain, then observation may be an option. Careful examination of the skin and genetic testing of genes on chromosomes 9 and 16 are not necessary in this case. Enucleation is not usually necessary for retinoblastoma, but it may be necessary if the tumor is not treatable with other methods.

Title: Erosive Deforming Inflammatory Arthritis in a Patient With Cervical Adenocarcinoma Case is: A 58-year-old white woman with history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma presented with multiple joint deformities. Her initial symptoms started 1 month after the initiation of nivolumab, which was 1 year prior to the index visit. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs failed, and the patient had a partial response to intra-articular steroids. She refused systemic therapies owing to concern about diminishing the effectiveness of nivolumab. Despite the joint symptoms, nivolumab treatment was continued for a year. Evaluation showed fixed swan neck deformities in multiple fingers (Figure, A). There was evidence of chronic synovial hypertrophy with no active synovitis on examination. The results of a comprehensive autoantibody blood panel, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody, were unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the hands demonstrated diffuse osteopenia, joint space narrowing, and multiple deformities. Magnetic resonance imaging of both hands revealed multifocal osseous erosions (Figure, B), synovitis, and tenosynovitis.Erosive deforming inflammatory arthritis.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 58-year-old white woman with history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma. She presented with multiple joint deformities, which started 1 month after the initiation of nivolumab. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs failed, and the patient had a partial response to intra-articular steroids. She refused systemic therapies owing to concern about diminishing the effectiveness of nivolumab. Despite the joint symptoms, nivolumab treatment was continued for a year.

Plain radiographs of the hands demonstrated diffuse osteopenia, joint space narrowing, and multiple deformities. Magnetic resonance imaging of both hands revealed multifocal osseous erosions, synovitis, and tenosynovitis.

The most likely diagnosis is nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. This is a rare but well-described complication of nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody that is used to treat cancer. Nivolumab works by blocking the action of a protein called PD-1, which is involved in the immune system's response to cancer cells. However, it can also affect the immune system's response to other cells in the body, including the cells that line the joints. This can lead to an inflammatory arthritis that can be very destructive.

The diagnosis of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The patient's history is consistent with nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis, as she developed joint symptoms shortly after starting treatment with nivolumab. Her physical examination is also consistent with the diagnosis, as she has fixed swan neck deformities in multiple fingers, which are characteristic of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. The results of her laboratory tests are also consistent with the diagnosis, as her comprehensive autoantibody blood panel was unremarkable, which would be expected in a patient with nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis.

The treatment of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is challenging. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and the treatment must be individualized to each patient. Some of the treatment options that have been used include corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the joint deformities.

The prognosis of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is variable. Some patients respond well to treatment and experience complete resolution of their symptoms. However, other patients have a more chronic course and may experience persistent joint pain and inflammation.

Title: Joint Pain and Proteinuria Case is: A 66-year-old man with a history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was evaluated for chronic joint pain and stiffness involving the shoulders, hips, and knees over the past 6 years. He had no fever, skin rash, headaches, vision changes, or urinary symptoms. He reported occasional bruising around his eyes. His only medication was acetaminophen as needed for pain. His vital signs were normal. No joint tenderness, warmth, or fluid collections were present, and skin examination was normal. The presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints (Figure, left panel) and scapulae (Figure, right panel) were noted. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal results for complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and levels of electrolytes, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. A spot urinalysis showed a protein level of 220 mg/dL (reference range, <26 mg/dL), and a 24-hour urine collection revealed 1.8 g of albumin (reference range, <229 mg/24 h).

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and is now presenting with chronic joint pain and stiffness involving the shoulders, hips, and knees. He also has proteinuria and raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae. Laboratory evaluation reveals normal results for complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and levels of electrolytes, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. A spot urinalysis showed a protein level of 220 mg/dL (reference range, <26 mg/dL), and a 24-hour urine collection revealed 1.8 g of albumin (reference range, <229 mg/24 h). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulders and hips showed synovial and capsular thickening.

The most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the joints, causing pain, stiffness, and swelling. It can also affect other organs, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chains (sFLC) assay. SPEP is a test that measures the levels of different proteins in the blood. sFLC is a test that measures the levels of light chains in the blood. Both of these tests can help to diagnose RA and monitor its progression.

If the patient is diagnosed with RA, he will likely be started on a course of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). DMARDs are medications that help to slow the progression of RA and improve the patient's quality of life.

**Reasoning:**

A 57-year-old white man with obesity and hypertension presents for a primary care visit, during which he expresses concern about having diabetes. He reports no symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as frequent urination, increased thirst, fatigue, or visual changes, and had no known family history of diabetes. A series of blood tests had recently been obtained (Table). His body mass index (BMI) is 33.9 and his blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. The patient wants to know if a test could be done in the office to determine if he has diabetes.

The patient's age, obesity, and hypertension are all risk factors for diabetes. The patient's lack of symptoms is not unusual, as many people with diabetes do not experience symptoms until their disease is well-established. The patient's blood sugar levels are normal, but his hemoglobin A1c is elevated. Hemoglobin A1c is a measure of blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. An elevated hemoglobin A1c indicates that the patient's blood sugar levels have been elevated over time.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, I would recommend performing a point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test via fingerstick to determine the patient's glycemic status. A POC HbA1c test is a simple, rapid test that can be performed in the office. It is a reliable and accurate measure of blood sugar control. A positive POC HbA1c test would confirm the diagnosis of diabetes and allow me to begin treatment. A negative POC HbA1c test would reassure the patient and allow me to focus on other risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity and hypertension.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous pseudolymphoma. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a non-neoplastic skin condition that can mimic lymphoma. It is characterized by the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the skin, but these cells do not have the ability to spread to other parts of the body. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is most common in middle-aged and older adults, and it is more common in women than men. The most common presentation is a solitary or multiple nodules on the skin. The nodules can be red, brown, or purple, and they may be scaly or crusted. They can be itchy, but they are usually not painful. The diagnosis of cutaneous pseudolymphoma is made based on a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of atypical lymphocytes, but it will not show any evidence of lymphoma. The treatment of cutaneous pseudolymphoma is usually not necessary. The lesions may resolve on their own, or they may be treated with topical steroids or other medications. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions.

The rims of the lesions were raised with slight white scale and the centers slightly depressed and wrinkled in appearance.

The differential diagnosis for atrophic annular plaques on the breasts includes:

* Erythema annulare centrifugum
* Annular atrophic lichen planus
* Porokeratosis
* Granuloma annulare

Erythema annulare centrifugum is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by annular erythematous plaques with a raised, scaly border. The lesions typically occur on the trunk, arms, and legs, but can also occur on the breasts.

Annular atrophic lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by atrophic, erythematous plaques with a fine, white scale. The lesions typically occur on the hands, feet, and genitals, but can also occur on the breasts.

Porokeratosis is a chronic, acquired skin disease characterized by discrete, well-demarcated, hyperkeratotic papules. The lesions typically occur on the sun-exposed areas of the skin, but can also occur on the breasts.

Granuloma annulare is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by annular, erythematous plaques with a central depression. The lesions typically occur on the hands, feet, and arms, but can also occur on the breasts.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of erythema annulare centrifugum. The patient has a history of breast augmentation surgery, and the lesions are located on the inferior medial bilateral breasts. The lesions are slightly erythematous, annular, and have a raised, scaly border. The differential diagnosis for atrophic annular plaques on the breasts includes erythema annulare centrifugum, annular atrophic lichen planus, porokeratosis, and granuloma annulare. The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of erythema annulare centrifugum.

Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord.

The most likely diagnosis is **A: Postinfectious myelopathy**. This is a demyelinating disorder of the spinal cord that can occur after a viral infection, such as Epstein-Barr virus or varicella zoster virus. The patient's history of travel to Yosemite National Park suggests that she may have been exposed to a tick-borne virus such as Lyme disease, which can also cause postinfectious myelopathy. The patient's MRI findings are consistent with a demyelinating process, and her lumbar puncture results are negative for infectious and inflammatory causes. The whole-body positron emission tomography findings are also consistent with a demyelinating process.

The differential diagnosis for postinfectious myelopathy includes other demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and neuromyelitis optica. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of postinfectious myelopathy.

**Treatment:**

There is no specific treatment for postinfectious myelopathy. Treatment is supportive and includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation. The patient's prognosis is variable, but most patients make a good recovery with time.

Title: Middle-aged Man With Exertional Dyspnea and Neck Fullness Case is: A man in his mid-50s with no significant medical history was referred with 2 years of insidious exertional dyspnea and neck fullness. Examination of the jugular venous contour with the patient sitting upright at 90° is shown in Video 1. Auscultatory findings at the left lower sternal border showed normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with a diastolic sound and no murmurs (Figure 1; Video 2). Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged, pulsatile liver with smooth edges palpable 4 cm below the costal margin. Electrocardiography showed resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography showed normal heart size and clear lungs (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which showed normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities.A, Phonocardiography from the left sternal border.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a middle-aged man with no significant medical history who presents with 2 years of insidious exertional dyspnea and neck fullness. Examination of the jugular venous contour shows distention with prominent A waves. Auscultatory findings at the left lower sternal border show a diastolic sound (S3 gallop). Abdominal examination reveals an enlarged, pulsatile liver. Electrocardiography shows resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography shows normal heart size and clear lungs. Transthoracic echocardiography shows normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis is right ventricular failure. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. The jugular venous distention with prominent A waves suggests right atrial hypertension, which is a common finding in right ventricular failure. The diastolic sound at the left lower sternal border is a S3 gallop, which is a characteristic finding of right ventricular failure. The enlarged, pulsatile liver is a sign of hepatic congestion, which is also a common finding in right ventricular failure. The electrocardiographic findings of rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions are non-specific but can be seen in right ventricular failure. The posteroanterior chest radiograph shows normal heart size and clear lungs, which is consistent with the diagnosis of right ventricular failure. The transthoracic echocardiographic findings of normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities are also consistent with the diagnosis of right ventricular failure.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). TEE is a more sensitive and specific test than transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of right ventricular failure. TEE can also be used to assess the severity of right ventricular failure and to identify the underlying cause of the right ventricular failure.

**Answer:** A. Transesophageal echocardiography.

Title: Breast Mass in an African American Man Case is: A 43-year-old African American man presented with a nontender, self-palpated mass in his left breast. He had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and was a current smoker. His medications included carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history was significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was 53. His left nipple was retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel).

Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).

The differential diagnosis for a breast mass in a man includes breast cancer, gynecomastia, and lipoma. Breast cancer is the most serious possibility, and it is important to rule it out in any man with a breast mass. Gynecomastia is a benign condition characterized by enlargement of the male breast. It is often caused by hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, or certain medical conditions. Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat tissue. It is the most common type of tumor in the body, and it is usually not harmful.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. This procedure involves inserting a needle into the mass and removing a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. The results of the biopsy will help to determine the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

The patient revealed that he had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. Dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a severe, life-threatening mucocutaneous disorder that is characterized by fever, rash, and mucosal lesions. The rash typically begins as erythematous macules and papules that progress to bullae and erosions. The mucosal lesions can involve the mouth, eyes, genitals, and gastrointestinal tract. SJS is often associated with an underlying infection, such as a viral infection or an adverse reaction to a medication. The treatment for SJS is supportive care, including fluid and electrolyte replacement, nutritional support, and skin care. In severe cases, corticosteroids may be used.

The other possible diagnoses are bullous pemphigus, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and multiforme erythema. Bullous pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. TEN is a severe, life-threatening skin disorder that is characterized by the widespread detachment of the skin. Multiforme erythema is a skin disorder that is characterized by a rash of red, scaly patches.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of SJS. The patient's history of a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously is also consistent with SJS. The patient's rash is characteristic of SJS, and the mucosal lesions involve the mouth, eyes, and genitals. The patient has no evidence of bullous pemphigus, TEN, or multiforme erythema.

The most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a severe, life-threatening mucocutaneous disease that is characterized by fever, skin rash, and mucosal lesions. It is most commonly caused by an allergic reaction to medication, but it can also be caused by infections, such as herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus. The skin rash is typically widespread and involves the palms and soles of the feet. The mucosal lesions can involve the eyes, mouth, nose, throat, and genitals. SJS can be fatal if it is not treated promptly.

The differential diagnosis for SJS includes toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), bullous pemphigoid, and multiforme erythema. TEN is a more severe form of SJS that is characterized by extensive skin detachment. Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Multiforme erythema is a self-limiting skin rash that is often caused by an infection or medication.

The patient's history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of SJS. The patient should be treated immediately with corticosteroids and supportive care.

Title: Progressive Bilateral Nasal Obstruction Due to Nasopharyngeal Mass Case is: A healthy Asian man in his 20s presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. He also complained of recurrent epistaxis. He had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging (Figure, A and B) revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results (Figure, C and D) showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results.

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx. Papillary adenocarcinoma is a rare type of cancer that typically arises from the epithelial cells that line the nasopharynx. It is more common in Asian men than in other populations. The typical presentation of papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx is a slowly growing mass in the nasopharynx that may cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and hearing loss. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the mass. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the mass, followed by radiation therapy. The prognosis for papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx is generally good, with most patients surviving for many years after diagnosis.

Corneal scrapes were performed and samples were sent for microscopy with Gram staining, culture, and sensitivity testing. The patient was admitted on that day and commenced taking topical cefuroxime, 5%, and gentamicin, 1.5%, drops every hour around the clock, and topical steroid was discontinued. One day later, there was no improvement in the graft-host interface haze, and results of microbiological investigations, including donor rim culture, were all negative. In view of the clinical dilemma, an in vivo confocal microscopy was performed to aid the diagnosis.

The in vivo confocal microscopy showed diffuse hyperreflective crisscross changes at the graft-host interface. This finding is highly suggestive of graft rejection. Graft rejection is a serious complication of DSAEK that can lead to graft failure. The treatment for graft rejection is removal of the DSAEK graft and re-endothelialization of the cornea with a new graft.

In this case, the patient has a clinical picture of graft rejection with a negative microbiological workup. The in vivo confocal microscopy findings are highly suggestive of graft rejection. The treatment for graft rejection is removal of the DSAEK graft and re-endothelialization of the cornea with a new graft. Therefore, the correct answer is: **D. Bring the patient to the operating room urgently and remove and send the DSAEK graft for microbiological culture and sensitivity.**

Title: An 81-Year-Old Man With Multifocal Choroidal Lesions Case is: An 81-year-old Mexican man was evaluated in the retina clinic for scattered subretinal lesions in the right eye. He complained of a gradual decline in his vision bilaterally over the past 2 years. He denied flashes, floaters, or eye pain but endorsed a chronic cough. He had no known ocular or medical history and took no systemic medications. He was born and raised in Mexico prior to his immigration to the United States 5 years before presentation. He worked as a farmer and denied recent illnesses, contacts with illnesses, alcohol or tobacco use, and having pets. His visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS with normal intraocular pressures. His slitlamp examination results were notable for mild nuclear sclerosis in both eyes and were negative for conjunctival or corneal lesions. He had round, reactive pupils and no anterior chamber inflammation in either eye. Dilated fundus examination results revealed a few pigmented anterior vitreous cells, a normal optic disc, and flat and large yellowish chorioretinal lesions with overlying pigment scattered throughout the macula and periphery in the right eye (Figure). The left eye had several similar chorioretinal lesions in the superotemporal periphery.Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotyping (eg, for HLA-A29)What Would You Do Next?

Title: Acute Onset of Blurry Vision in a Young Man Case is: A 25-year-old man presented to an ophthalmologist outside the authors’ department with acutely decreased visual acuity in both eyes. He had woken up earlier that morning with normal visual acuity, but his visual acuity had progressively worsened to the point that he was unable to work. He denied additional symptoms, other than mild tearing. Per his ophthalmologist, his visual acuity improved with a −10 diopter lens, but his intraocular pressure was elevated to between 30 and 40 mm Hg OU. The patient was sent to the emergency department, where the authors’ consultation team evaluated him. The patient’s medical history was remarkable for hypertension and asthma. He denied smoking, drinking alcohol, and using recreational drugs. A review of symptoms was otherwise negative. His medications included losartan, albuterol, and fluticasone. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/400 OU (while wearing prescription lenses, −2.75 + 1.00 × 090 OD and −2.50 + 1.00 × 081 OS). His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU (manifest refraction, −12.00 + 1.75 × 097 OD and −10.75 + 0.25 × 050 OS). His intraocular pressure was 19 OU. Sensorimotor and external examination results were normal. A slitlamp examination revealed mild diffuse vasodilation and temporal chemosis, clear corneas, shallow anterior chambers, and clear lenses in both eyes. A gonioscopic examination showed no angle structures in either eye. Results of an undilated fundus examination was unremarkable. Figure 1 shows ultrasonographic images of his eyes.Images on initial presentation. A, B-scan on initial presentation showed no masses and shallow choroidal effusion.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient presents with acute onset of blurry vision in both eyes, with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/400 OU. His intraocular pressure is elevated to 30-40 mm Hg OU. On examination, he has mild diffuse vasodilation and temporal chemosis, clear corneas, shallow anterior chambers, and clear lenses in both eyes. A gonioscopic examination showed no angle structures in either eye. Results of an undilated fundus examination was unremarkable. Figure 1 shows ultrasonographic images of his eyes.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes acute angle-closure glaucoma, anterior uveitis, and posterior uveitis. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's elevated intraocular pressure, shallow anterior chambers, and lack of angle structures on gonioscopy. Anterior uveitis is also a possibility, given the patient's mild diffuse vasodilation and temporal chemosis. However, the absence of cells in the anterior chamber and vitreous on examination makes this diagnosis less likely. Posterior uveitis is less likely than acute angle-closure glaucoma or anterior uveitis, given the patient's unremarkable fundus examination.

The next step in management is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and brain to rule out any underlying mass lesions. If an MRI is negative, the patient should be treated with laser peripheral iridotomy to open the angle and lower the intraocular pressure. The patient should also be started on topical steroids and cycloplegics to control the inflammation.

Title: Uncovered Undulations Case is: A 53-year-old man presented to his ophthalmologist for a newly noticed bulging left eye. He reported several eyeglass prescription changes in the left eye over the past 2 years and frequent ipsilateral tearing. He denied ocular discomfort, headaches, or double vision. He had a distant history of right temple melanoma that was excised with clean margins and accompanied by a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy result.On examination, he was found to have a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS, with a normal pupillary response and intact color vision bilaterally. He had a mild limitation of left abduction and supraduction. He had 5 mm of relative left proptosis, with moderate resistance to retropulsion of the left globe. No change in globe position was appreciated with systolic pulsations or the Valsalva maneuver. Anterior segment examination results were normal bilaterally. Dilated fundus examination results of the left eye revealed an abnormality of the posterior pole (Figure 1A), which was confirmed on fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B).Color fundus photograph (A) and fluorescein angiography (B).What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:** The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of right temple melanoma that was excised with clean margins and accompanied by a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy result. He presents with a newly noticed bulging left eye, several eyeglass prescription changes in the left eye over the past 2 years, and frequent ipsilateral tearing. On examination, he is found to have 5 mm of relative left proptosis, with moderate resistance to retropulsion of the left globe. No change in globe position is appreciated with systolic pulsations or the Valsalva maneuver. Anterior segment examination results are normal bilaterally. Dilated fundus examination results of the left eye reveal an abnormality of the posterior pole.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes orbital pseudotumor, Graves' orbitopathy, and metastatic disease. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition of the orbit that can cause proptosis, pain, and limitation of extraocular movements. Graves' orbitopathy is an autoimmune condition that can cause proptosis, periorbital edema, and lid retraction. Metastatic disease to the orbit can occur from a variety of primary tumors, including melanoma.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for evaluating the orbit and can help to distinguish between orbital pseudotumor, Graves' orbitopathy, and metastatic disease.

Title: Weakness and Myalgia in a Patient With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Undergoing Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy Case is: A 59-year-old man with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was found to have a 12.4-cm liver mass, with imaging characteristics concerning for malignant neoplasm (Figure, A). A biopsy was performed, and pathology results were consistent with a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. He enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03299946) using neoadjuvant cabozantinib plus nivolumab followed by definitive resection for patients with locally advanced disease.A, Magnetic resonance image of the abdomen shows a liver mass. B, On single-fiber electromyography, the mean consecutive difference of the tested pairs was abnormal, and there was no blocking.Five weeks after the first dose of nivolumab, he developed diplopia and myalgia that mostly affected proximal muscle groups. Physical examination revealed ptosis, modest restriction of ocular motility in all directions bilaterally, and esotropia with left hypertropia in the primary gaze. Muscle strength was 5/5 on hip flexion and extension bilaterally. There was no weakness with repetitive and sustained testing of power. Workup revealed elevated creatine kinase (1222 U/L; reference range, 24-195 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]), aldolase (24.5 U/L; reference range, <8.1 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]), and C-reactive protein levels (106 mg/L; reference range, <5 mg/L [to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 9.524]).Acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels were elevated (0.69 nmol/L [reference range, <0.3 nmol/L] and 48% [reference range, 0%-20%], respectively). Results of the striated muscle antibody titer were also abnormal (1:160; reference range, <1:40). Blood test results were negative for acetylcholine receptor blocking and muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Nerve conduction studies showed a normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation. Single-fiber electromyography was pathologic and revealed an abnormal mean consecutive difference in more than 50% of the tested pairs (Figure, B), and no blocking was seen. Myopathic action potentials were not present. A chest computed tomographic scan ruled out the presence of a thymoma.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Guillain-Barré syndrome , B: Lambert-Eaton syndrome , C: Miller Fisher syndrome , D: Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and presentation are consistent with myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness of skeletal muscles. The weakness is typically worse with repetitive use of the muscles and improves with rest. The patient in this case developed diplopia and myalgia that mostly affected proximal muscle groups, which are consistent with the symptoms of myasthenia gravis. The patient's physical examination revealed ptosis, modest restriction of ocular motility in all directions bilaterally, and esotropia with left hypertropia in the primary gaze. These findings are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's workup revealed elevated creatine kinase, aldolase, and C-reactive protein levels. These findings are nonspecific, but they can be seen in patients with myasthenia gravis. The patient's acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels were elevated, which is diagnostic of myasthenia gravis. The patient's blood test results were negative for acetylcholine receptor blocking and muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. These findings are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's nerve conduction studies showed a normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation. This finding is also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's single-fiber electromyography was pathologic and revealed an abnormal mean consecutive difference in more than 50% of the tested pairs, and no blocking was seen. These findings are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The patient's chest computed tomographic scan ruled out the presence of a thymoma. This finding is important, as thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis.

Title: Rapidly Progressive Vision Loss in a Patient With Breast Cancer Case is: A 67-year-old white female patient with metastatic breast cancer, currently taking capecitabine plus trastuzumab, presented with 2 weeks of painless reduced vision in her right eye (OD). Her breast cancer was diagnosed in 2007 as stage IA estrogen-receptor positive, progesterone-receptor negative (ER+, PR−), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2) negative, initially treated with lumpectomy plus left breast radiotherapy followed by doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and anastrazole. In 2017, metastases were found in the lumbar spine and lung and treated with fulvestrant and palbociclib plus left brachial plexus radiotherapy. Later, progressive liver metastasis and repeat biopsy with equivocal ERBB2 testing led to treatment with capecitabine plus trastuzumab.On presentation to the ophthalmologist, her visual acuity was reduced to only being able to count fingers (worse than 20/400) OD and 20/40 in the left eye (OS). Visual acuity was 20/25 bilaterally at her last eye examination, 1 year prior. She reported not experiencing any headache, photophobia, diplopia, or eye pain. Ocular motility, pupillary response, and intraocular pressure were normal for each eye. On slit lamp examination, the anterior segment of each eye was normal, without inflammation or blood. On ophthalmoscopic examination, placoid yellow choroidal lesions with ill-defined borders and subretinal fluid were seen in each eye (Figure 1).Inject intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into both eyesObtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbitsWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 20s who presented with a 6-year history of multiple growing papules superimposed on an asymptomatic firm plaque on the occipital scalp.

Physical examination revealed a group of unevenly distributed skin–colored-to-pink, discrete, coalescing papules superimposed on a firm plaque on the occipital scalp. A biopsy specimen was obtained from one of these papules. Another biopsy from a facial papule demonstrated features of angiofibroma.

The most likely diagnosis is fibrous cephalic plaque. Fibrous cephalic plaques are benign, non-inflammatory, fibrotic lesions that occur most commonly in children and young adults. They are characterized by a firm, plaque-like lesion on the scalp, often with overlying papules. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but may be associated with pruritus or pain. The cause of fibrous cephalic plaques is unknown, but they are thought to be a form of localized scleroderma.

The differential diagnosis of fibrous cephalic plaques includes other benign, non-inflammatory, fibrotic lesions of the scalp, such as keloids, scleroderma en coup de sabre, and linear scleroderma. Keloids are raised, hypertrophic scars that often form after trauma. Scleroderma en coup de sabre is a linear scleroderma that affects the face and scalp. Linear scleroderma is a more generalized form of scleroderma that can affect the skin, muscles, and internal organs.

The diagnosis of fibrous cephalic plaques is made clinically based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. Biopsy may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other possible causes. There is no specific treatment for fibrous cephalic plaques. Treatment is typically aimed at relieving symptoms, such as pruritus or pain. Topical steroids, oral steroids, and laser therapy have been used with variable success.

Laboratory test results, including creatine kinase, thyrotropin, antinuclear antibodies, paraneoplastic antibodies (includes Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, and amphiphysin antibodies), were normal. Chest computed tomography results were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is autoimmune Isaacs syndrome. Isaacs syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by generalized muscle stiffness, cramps, and fasciculations. It is caused by antibodies that attack the nerves that control muscle movement. The symptoms of Isaacs syndrome usually begin in adulthood, and they can vary in severity from person to person. Some people with Isaacs syndrome may only have mild symptoms, while others may have severe symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life.

The diagnosis of Isaacs syndrome is based on a clinical history and physical examination. Laboratory tests, such as blood tests and nerve conduction studies, can be used to support the diagnosis. However, there is no single test that can definitively diagnose Isaacs syndrome.

There is no cure for Isaacs syndrome, but there are treatments that can help to improve the symptoms. Treatment typically involves a combination of medications and physical therapy. Medications that are used to treat Isaacs syndrome include steroids, immunosuppressants, and calcium channel blockers. Physical therapy can help to improve muscle strength and range of motion.

The prognosis for people with Isaacs syndrome varies depending on the severity of their symptoms. With treatment, most people with Isaacs syndrome are able to live relatively normal lives. However, some people with Isaacs syndrome may have significant disability.

Title: A Young Woman With Refractory Vasospastic Angina Case is: A woman in her early 30s with a history of mild bronchial asthma and nasal polyps presented to the emergency department with chest pain, electrocardiographic ST elevation, and sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and was followed with coronary angiography, which showed significant 3-vessel stenosis that completely resolved after nitroglycerin injection. The patient was diagnosed as having vasospastic angina (VA); diltiazem and glyceryl trinitrate were prescribed, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted.Two months later, she presented with similar symptoms to another hospital; her ICD had not delivered a shock. Because she was not carrying her medical records, she was immediately transferred to the catheterization laboratory. Angiography was again performed and showed severe spasm of all coronary vessels that resolved after nitroglycerin administration (Figure). Medical treatment was intensified by adding verapamil and a statin to the regimen.Total occlusion of all coronary arteries during cardiac arrest (A) that was completely resolved after nitroglycerin administration (B).Four months later, the patient was admitted to our center in an unconscious state. The electrocardiogram showed asystole with pacemaker spikes not followed by QRS complexes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, but after 10 minutes of resuscitation there was no response. Given her history of VA, we started nitroglycerin infusion, which resulted in return to normal sinus rhythm after 5 minutes with a palpable peripheral pulse.Despite the intensification of therapy with isosorbide mononitrate and concomitant use of amlodipine, diltiazem, and benzodiazepine, the patient experienced another episode of asystole and multiple episodes of asymptomatic ST-T changes in the coronary care unit.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a history of vasospastic angina, which is a condition that causes the coronary arteries to narrow and restrict blood flow to the heart. This can lead to chest pain, heart attack, and sudden cardiac death. The patient has already had two episodes of cardiac arrest, and her ejection fraction has declined to 30%. This indicates that she is at high risk for further cardiac events.

Surgical revascularization, which is the creation of new blood vessels to bypass the narrowed or blocked arteries, is a treatment option for patients with vasospastic angina. However, this procedure is associated with significant risks, including bleeding, infection, and heart attack. Percutaneous revascularization, which is the use of a balloon or stent to open up the narrowed or blocked arteries, is a less invasive procedure that is associated with fewer risks.

In this case, the patient has already had two episodes of cardiac arrest and her ejection fraction has declined to 30%. This indicates that she is at high risk for further cardiac events. Therefore, I would recommend that the patient undergo percutaneous revascularization. This procedure is less invasive than surgical revascularization and is associated with fewer risks. It is also likely to be effective in relieving the patient's symptoms and preventing further cardiac events.

Title: Incidental Sphenoid Mass Found on Facial Trauma Workup Case is: A healthy 30-year old man presented to the emergency department with facial trauma after an assault. Physical examination was notable for tenderness over the nasal bones. No neurologic deficits were noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast revealed nasal bone fractures and an incidental 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus (Figure 1A) with an apparent dehiscence of the posterior wall and possible communication with the intracranial extra-axial spaces and brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance imaging scan with contrast was recommended to further characterize the lesion which showed a transosseous T1 dark, T2 bright multilobulated mass measuring 2.1 × 1.4 × 1.3 cm with heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging extending into the sphenoid sinus. An endoscopic transnasal approach was used to obtain a tissue biopsy specimen.

The most likely diagnosis is chordoma. Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors that arise from remnants of the notochord, a structure that forms the backbone in early development. They typically occur in the sacrum or clivus, the part of the skull base that articulates with the first cervical vertebra. Chordomas are locally invasive but rarely metastasize.

The diagnosis of chordoma is based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and pathologic analysis. CT scans typically show a lobulated, destructive mass with calcifications. MRI scans show a T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense mass with heterogeneous enhancement. Pathologic analysis reveals sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated cells with a myxoid background.

The treatment of chordoma is surgical resection. Radiation therapy may be used to treat residual disease or in cases where surgery is not possible. Chemotherapy is not effective for chordoma.

The prognosis for patients with chordoma is poor. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 50%. However, patients with well-differentiated chordomas have a better prognosis than those with poorly differentiated chordomas.

Title: Unilateral Nasal Mass in a Woman in Her 20s Case is: A 29-year-old healthy woman presented with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall (Figure, A).A, Coronal view of contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography obtained after initial biopsy and before resection showing tumor involvement of lateral nasal sidewall and nasolacrimal duct. B and C, Hematoxylin eosin–stained histologic sections of tumor after resection showing bony invasion by sheets of undifferentiated cells (B) and focal areas of abrupt keratinization (C).The patient subsequently underwent left medial maxillectomy via lateral rhinotomy approach, with resection of residual tumor. The tumor appeared to originate from left lateral nasal wall, with involvement of nasal floor and extension into the orbit and periorbita.Histologically, the tumor extensively eroded maxillary bone, with abundant necrosis and widespread involvement of surgical margins. Microscopic examination showed sheets of monomorphic undifferentiated tumor cells with interspersed areas of abrupt squamous differentiation and keratinization (Figure, B and C).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 29-year-old woman with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin.

The differential diagnosis for a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity includes olfactory neuroblastoma, sinonasal lymphoma, NUT carcinoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare, highly malignant tumor that typically arises from the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Sinonasal lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically arises from the mucosa of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. NUT carcinoma is a rare, aggressive carcinoma that typically arises from the sinonasal tract or nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a common carcinoma that typically arises from the nasopharynx.

In this case, the patient's age, gender, and clinical presentation are consistent with a diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma. The patient's noncontrasted computed tomography scan shows a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. This is a typical finding for olfactory neuroblastoma. The patient's biopsy results show poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This is a common finding in olfactory neuroblastoma. The patient's IHC staining is positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. This is a typical finding in olfactory neuroblastoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is olfactory neuroblastoma.

Title: A Case of Childhood Hearing Loss Case is: An 8-year-old boy accompanied by his mother presented with hearing loss. The patient failed a school-administered hearing screening as well as a subsequent hearing screening performed by his pediatrician. According to his mother, the patient had struggled with his hearing, often failing to respond to vocalizations and requiring statements to be frequently repeated. He reportedly passed his newborn hearing screening and his mother had no serious hearing concerns prior to his failed school screening. Physical examination revealed no effusions, while formal audiological testing revealed restricted middle ear mobility and bilateral moderately severe mixed hearing loss rising to normal hearing sensitivity in both ears (Figure, A). Medical history included corrective lens replacement surgery in early childhood and a family history of childhood hearing loss in the patient’s maternal grandfather. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the temporal bones revealed bilateral enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts (Figure, B), fistulous communication between the internal auditory canal (IAC) and the basal turn of the cochlea (Figure, C), and a bulbous dilation of the IAC (Figure, D). Given the family history of childhood-onset hearing loss, genetic testing was performed and revealed genetic mutation of the POU3F4 gene.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: Rare Case of Bilateral Orbital Masses Case is: A 60-year-old woman with a history of Lyme disease presented with polydipsia and polyuria and received a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results revealed a thickening and enhancement of the pituitary gland, stalk, and hypothalamus. The abnormal imaging findings improved on subsequent MRIs without treatment. Surveillance pituitary MRIs remained stable. Four years later, MRI results (Figure) revealed bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. The optic nerves were encased with no evidence of infiltration of the nerves, vascular structures, or extraocular muscles. She reported the sensation of eye fullness and denied pain. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupils were symmetric and responded to light and near effort; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The results of testing with an Amsler grid and Ishihara color plates were normal. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. The optic nerves and retina were normal bilaterally. There was bilateral periorbital swelling and proptosis. Exophthalmometry measurements on a base of 92 were 17 mm on the right and 19 mm on the left.

Title: Pigmented Macular Lesion in a Child Case is: A 5-year-old boy with a history of an Escherichia coli infection complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome presented with a visual acuity of 20/125 OD and 20/20 OS (HOTV letters). He had no history of hearing loss or pigmented skin lesions. He had no past ocular history or prior ophthalmic examinations. Color vision was severely diminished in the right eye, as determined by Ishihara color plates, and he had no detectable stereoacuity, as determined by Titmus testing. Intraocular pressure and extraocular movements were normal. He had a mild relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye but no strabismus or nystagmus. The cycloplegic refraction was +2.50 + 0.50 × 100 OD and +2.00 sphere OS. Results of an anterior segment slitlamp biomicroscopy examination showed no abnormalities. Results of a dilated retinal examination showed a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye with temporal pallor of the optic disc (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography demonstrated gliosis with a tractional epiretinal membrane and modest disorganization of the retinal layers, producing a sawtooth configuration within the outer plexiform layer (Figure, B).Refer patient for consideration of plaque brachytherapy or enucleation of the right eyeOrder magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluationPerform a vitreous tap and inject with antiviralsWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye with temporal pallor of the optic disc. This is consistent with a diagnosis of retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina. The most common treatment for retinoblastoma is enucleation, or removal of the affected eye. However, in some cases, plaque brachytherapy, a type of radiation therapy, may be an option. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation are also important to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brain tumor or a genetic disorder. Oral corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation and swelling, but they are not curative. Vitreous tap and injection with antivirals is not an appropriate treatment for retinoblastoma.

Title: Intermittent Temporal Visual Field Loss in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A 45-year-old man presented with floaters in his left eye and headaches for 2 months. He experienced left temporal field loss when lifting heavy objects. He took no medications and denied prior surgery, eye trauma, or pain. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. The only abnormalities on bilateral eye examination were 1+ levels of anterior vitreous cells and trace levels of posterior vitreous cells in the left eye, without vitreous haze, and a left retinal detachment extending from 1:30 to 10:00 o’clock, with macular involvement and without visible retinal tears. There were 360° left choroidal detachments.Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening in both maculae. Fluorescein angiography (FA) of the right eye gave normal results. Figure 1A depicts the FA image of the left eye. On B-scan ultrasonography, there was a subclinical choroidal detachment superonasally in the right eye. An ultrasonographic image confirmed the detachments in the left eye (Figure 1B). The findings of a prior magnetic resonance image of the brain, chest radiographic image, and computed tomographic image of the chest were unremarkable. Test results for syphilis, tuberculosis, bartonella, and toxoplasma were negative, as were test results for inflammatory markers, quantitative serum proteins, and immunoglobulins.Images of the left eye at baseline. A, Midphase fluorescein angiography of the left eye. There are multiple peripheral areas of punctate hyperfluorescence. Leakage is more pronounced posteriorly around the nerve. There is scattered blockage of background fluorescence owing to retinal pigment epithelium mottling, which creates a leopard-spot pattern. A retinal detachment is seen inferiorly with tortuous vessels and nonfluorescent subretinal fluid. B, A B-scan ultrasonographic image of the left eye in the longitudinal 6 o’clock meridian demonstrates retinal detachment and a nonserous choroidal detachment superiorly. The optic nerve shadow is seen inferiorly. There is no fluid in the Tenon capsule. The detachment was mapped to extend from 1:30 to 10:00 o’clock and involve the macula. The maximum height of the choroidal detachment was 3.4 mm. No retinal tear was visualized.The patient started receiving 60 mg of oral prednisone  daily. Three weeks later, his best-corrected visual acuity worsened to 20/50 OS. A posterior sub-Tenon injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide was given, along with tapering doses of oral prednisone for 6 more weeks. There was further decline in visual acuity to 20/60 OS and worsening subretinal fluid.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a retinal detachment with macular involvement. He has already received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 3 weeks, with no improvement. A posterior sub-Tenon injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide was given, along with tapering doses of oral prednisone for 6 more weeks. There was further decline in visual acuity to 20/60 OS and worsening subretinal fluid.

The next step in management is to perform a diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing. This will help to determine the cause of the retinal detachment. If the detachment is caused by an infectious process, then the patient will need to receive specific antibiotics. If the detachment is caused by a non-infectious process, then the patient may need to undergo surgery to create a scleral buckle or scleral windows.

Title: A Patient With Type 1 Diabetes, Visual Acuity Loss, and Retinal Thickening Case is: A 24-year-old man presented with substantial loss of visual acuity in the left eye. He had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 5 years prior and had never been examined for diabetic retinopathy. At the initial examination, his hemoglobin A1c level was 11.0% (to convert to the proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), suggesting a lack of compliance with his diabetic treatment regimen. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100 OS and 20/60 OD. On examination of the left eye, the anterior segments were unremarkable, with no neovascularization of the angle or iris. However, there was considerable retinal thickening, substantial capillary nonperfusion in the macular area, and a large area of disc neovascularization (in more than one-third of the disc area), with leakage on the disc associated with prepapillary neovascularization, as confirmed by fluorescein angiography (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography confirmed retinal thickening in the macular area (central subfield thickness [CST], 805 μm), with cystoid abnormalities throughout the retinal layers as well as subretinal fluid (Figure 1B).A, Large prepapillary neovascular complex, nonperfusion in the macula and the periphery, and central subfield involvement of the macular edema is visible.

Reasoning: The patient has type 1 diabetes and has developed diabetic retinopathy, which is a leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes. The patient has significant visual acuity loss in the left eye, with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/100. On examination of the left eye, there is considerable retinal thickening, substantial capillary nonperfusion in the macular area, and a large area of disc neovascularization (in more than one-third of the disc area), with leakage on the disc associated with prepapillary neovascularization, as confirmed by fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography confirmed retinal thickening in the macular area (central subfield thickness [CST], 805 μm), with cystoid abnormalities throughout the retinal layers as well as subretinal fluid.

The patient's best course of treatment is a combination of intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation. Intravitreal VEGF injections are a minimally invasive procedure that involves injecting a medication into the vitreous cavity of the eye. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, VEGF can cause the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to bleeding and scarring. Intravitreal VEGF injections help to reduce the growth of these abnormal blood vessels and improve vision.

Laser panretinal photocoagulation is a procedure that involves using a laser to destroy a small portion of the retina. This procedure is used to reduce the risk of blindness in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Laser panretinal photocoagulation helps to prevent the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina and reduce the risk of bleeding and scarring.

The combination of intravitreal VEGF injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation is the most effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy. This treatment has been shown to improve vision and reduce the risk of blindness in patients with diabetic retinopathy.

The most likely diagnosis is traumatic macular edema. This is a common complication of head trauma, and it is thought to be caused by shearing injury to the retinal capillaries. The edema typically resolves spontaneously within a few weeks, but it can sometimes lead to permanent vision loss.

The treatment of traumatic macular edema is controversial. Some experts recommend observation, while others recommend systemic or intraocular corticosteroid therapy. There is no clear evidence that one approach is superior to the other.

In this case, I would recommend observation. The patient's vision is only mildly decreased, and there is no evidence of retinal hemorrhage or detachment. The macular edema is likely to resolve on its own, and there is a risk of complications with corticosteroid therapy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a 30 cm-wide, easily bleeding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion of the left scapular region with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules. The lesion first appeared 5 months ago and has been rapidly expanding. The patient reports decreased appetite with weight loss of 7 kg over 5 months and denied fever, itching aside from the lesion, vomiting, or bowel alterations. Owing to intense and continuous pain from the lesion, she began opioid treatment with oxycodone/naloxone association at an initial dose of 5 mg/2.5 mg twice a day and titrated to 10 mg/5 mg twice a day after a week to achieve pain control. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed only a left adrenal gland mass, consistent with adenoma. On physical examination, there were no other cutaneous lesions though multiple ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes were present. All other physical and laboratory findings were unremarkable. A skin punch biopsy of the lesion was obtained.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer, loxoscelism, Merkel cell carcinoma, and primary cutaneous lymphoma (Sézary syndrome).

Cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer is a common presentation of this disease. The patient's history of weight loss and abdominal mass is consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, vomiting, or bowel alterations is atypical. Additionally, the patient's lesion is not typical of cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer, which typically presents as a solitary nodule.

Loxoscelism is a rare condition caused by the bite of the brown recluse spider. The patient's history of a rapidly expanding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules is consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, vomiting, or bowel alterations is atypical. Additionally, the patient's lesion is not typical of loxoscelism, which typically presents as a bulla with a central eschar.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer. The patient's history of a rapidly expanding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's weight loss and abdominal mass may be due to metastatic disease. Additionally, the patient's lesion is typical of Merkel cell carcinoma, which typically presents as a solitary nodule.

Primary cutaneous lymphoma (Sézary syndrome) is a rare, aggressive type of lymphoma. The patient's history of a rapidly expanding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's weight loss and abdominal mass may be due to metastatic disease. Additionally, the patient's lesion is typical of Sézary syndrome, which typically presents as a generalized erythroderma with scaling.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Title: A Woman With Dyspnea and Bronchiectasis Case is: A 41-year-old woman with an 8–pack-year history of tobacco use presented for progressive cough and dyspnea of 4 years’ duration. Her cough was productive of yellow-green sputum and treated with antibiotics on multiple occasions, which provided some alleviation of her symptoms. She had no history of neonatal respiratory distress, nasal congestion, persistent urticaria, joint laxity, or illicit drug use. She denied a family history of liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or cystic fibrosis. Examination revealed scattered wheezes and rhonchi on auscultation. Pulmonary function testing demonstrated a severe obstruction with a forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) of 0.79 L (28% of predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.64 L (47% of predicted), FEV1:FVC ratio of 48%, and a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 8.74 mL/min per mm Hg (23.75% of predicted), which was consistent with emphysema.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 41-year-old woman with an 8-pack-year history of tobacco use who presents with progressive cough and dyspnea of 4 years' duration. Her cough is productive of yellow-green sputum and treated with antibiotics on multiple occasions, which provided some alleviation of her symptoms.

Chest radiography followed by computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed lower lobe predominant emphysema and bronchiectasis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube is inserted into the airway to view the lungs and collect tissue samples. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a procedure in which a saline solution is instilled into the lungs and then suctioned out. This procedure can be used to collect cells from the lungs for analysis. Transbronchial biopsy is a procedure in which small pieces of tissue are removed from the lungs with a biopsy needle. These tissue samples can be used to diagnose the cause of the patient's lung disease.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype are used to diagnose α1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is a rare genetic disorder that can cause emphysema. However, the patient does not have a family history of this disorder, and her symptoms are not consistent with α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing are used to diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia, which is a rare genetic disorder that can cause chronic respiratory infections. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening are used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disorder that can cause chronic respiratory infections. However, the patient does not have a family history of cystic fibrosis, and her symptoms are not consistent with cystic fibrosis.

Title: Diffuse Poikilodermatous Patches in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A man in his 40s with a 5-year history of mildly pruritic poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the bilateral axilla and groin presented with expanding lesions on both flanks. He had not received any prior treatment for the lesions. On examination, there were hypopigmented and hyperpigmented reticulated patches and thin, atrophic plaques covering more than 10% of the total body surface area involving the axilla, groin, and flanks bilaterally (Figure, A). No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted. Results from a comprehensive review of systems was unremarkable. Results from a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses were normal. A 6-mm punch biopsy specimen from the right flank was obtained for histopathological examination (Figure, B). Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed (Figure, C and D).A, Hyperpigmented reticulated patches with central hypopigmentation on the right axilla.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient is a middle-aged man with a 5-year history of mildly pruritic poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the bilateral axilla and groin. The lesions have been expanding and now involve the flanks bilaterally. There is no lymphadenopathy. The results of a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses are normal. A punch biopsy specimen from the right flank was obtained for histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed.

The histopathological findings show a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with exocytosis of lymphocytes into the epidermis. There is also pigment incontinence and vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. The immunohistochemical findings show that the lymphocytes are positive for CD3 and CD4.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Mycosis fungoides is a chronic, indolent lymphoma that typically presents with patches of skin that are hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or atrophic. The lesions may be pruritic and may enlarge over time. In some cases, the lymphoma may progress to involve lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.

The differential diagnosis of mycosis fungoides includes other types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as Sézary syndrome, as well as other skin diseases that can cause poikiloderma, such as large-plaque parapsoriasis and Dowling-Degos disease.

Title: Linear and Arborizing Atrophic Plaque in an Elderly Man Case is: A man in his 80s presented with an 18-month history of an irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extending from the tip of his right shoulder to the right biceps, where it ended in arborizing purple plaque with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it (Figure, A and B). There was no warmth, thrills, or pulsations across the affected area. The patient complained about a mild tingling sensation within the lesion. The patient could not think of any triggers or causes for his condition and denied any aggravating or alleviating factors as well as any treatment attempts. Complete review of systems yielded negative results except for easy bruising. He was taking finasteride, montelukast, enalapril, and metoprolol. His medical history was significant for right total reverse shoulder replacement 5 years prior. Apart from the previously described lesion, his physical examination was unremarkable, and he had full range of motion of his right shoulder. A punch biopsy of the slightly indurated papule from the involved area on the right biceps was completed (Figure, C and D).A and B, An irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extends from the tip of the right shoulder to the right biceps, where it ends in arborizing purple plaque with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it.

Reasoning: The patient presents with an irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extending from the tip of his right shoulder to the right biceps, where it ends in arborizing purple plaque with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it. The lesion is associated with a mild tingling sensation. The patient has no history of triggers or causes for his condition, and he has not tried any treatments. His medical history is significant for right total reverse shoulder replacement 5 years prior. The physical examination is unremarkable, and he has full range of motion of his right shoulder. A punch biopsy of the slightly indurated papule from the involved area on the right biceps was completed, which showed a dermal infiltrate arranged in nodules with clefting between nodules; some inflammatory aggregates are also seen within dilated vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for CD68 antigen reveals that the infiltrate is composed mostly of histiocytes.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of linear morphea. Linear morphea is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by linear bands of sclerosis and atrophy of the skin. The lesions are typically unilateral and occur in children and young adults. The cause of linear morphea is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Treatment for linear morphea is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing the progression of the disease. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive medications.

Title: Diffuse Hyperpigmentation in a Patient With an Axillary Mass Case is: A white man in his early 40s with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rai stage 0) reported a 6-month history of a growing mass in his right axilla and weight loss. Physical examination revealed palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient was an active smoker (1 pack per day) with an unremarkable family history. A positron emission tomography scan showed a hypermetabolic right axillary lymph node that measured 5 × 5 cm as well as multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 8 cm. The results of a core needle biopsy specimen from the right axillary lymph node were consistent with malignant neoplasm, with immunohistochemistry staining positive for S100, HMB-45, and MART-1. He began pembrolizumab therapy.After starting treatment, the patient began to notice slowly worsening painless, nonpruritic, diffuse dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration (Figure). The results of laboratory studies revealed normal electrolytes, normal kidney function, mild elevation of liver function, and mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL (for SI unit conversion, multiply by 10.0 to convert to liters). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed worsening hepatic metastases and right axillary adenopathy.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a white man in his early 40s with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rai stage 0) who reported a 6-month history of a growing mass in his right axilla and weight loss. Physical examination revealed palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient was an active smoker (1 pack per day) with an unremarkable family history. A positron emission tomography scan showed a hypermetabolic right axillary lymph node that measured 5 × 5 cm as well as multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 8 cm. The results of a core needle biopsy specimen from the right axillary lymph node were consistent with malignant neoplasm, with immunohistochemistry staining positive for S100, HMB-45, and MART-1.

The results of laboratory studies revealed normal electrolytes, normal kidney function, mild elevation of liver function, and mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL (for SI unit conversion, multiply by 10.0 to convert to liters). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed worsening hepatic metastases and right axillary adenopathy.

The most likely diagnosis is Addison disease. Addison disease is an autoimmune disorder that results in adrenal insufficiency. The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney and produce hormones that help regulate blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and the immune system. When the adrenal glands are not producing enough hormones, it can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. In severe cases, Addison disease can lead to shock and death.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Addison disease. He has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can lead to Addison disease by damaging the adrenal glands. The patient also has a history of smoking, which can increase the risk of Addison disease.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with Addison disease. He has a mild anemia, which is a low red blood cell count. Anemia is a common symptom of Addison disease. The patient also has a mild elevation of liver function tests, which can be seen in Addison disease.

The patient's imaging studies are also consistent with Addison disease. The CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed worsening hepatic metastases and right axillary adenopathy. Hepatic metastases are tumors that have spread from the adrenal glands to the liver. Right axillary adenopathy is a lymph node enlargement in the right armpit. Both of these findings are common in Addison disease.

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are all consistent with Addison disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Addison disease.

Title: A 44-Year-Old Woman With Dilated Cardiomyopathy Case is: A 44-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy while receiving maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy presented after ventricular fibrillation arrest and subsequently underwent an uneventful implant of a subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD; EMBLEM, version A219; Boston Scientific) for secondary prevention. The device was programmed with a conditional shock zone of 200 beats per minute and a shock zone of 230 beats per minute. Postprocedure chest radiography results showed appropriate device placement. Postimplant interrogation results showed appropriate device function. The patient was discharged the day after implant. Two weeks later, she presented to the emergency department (ED) after receiving several shocks from the device during the early morning, waking her up from sleeping. There were no reported symptoms associated with shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope. Physical examination results revealed no signs of decompensated heart failure. Device interrogation results showed shock therapies delivered postimplant on days 3, 5, 6, and 10. The surface electrogram from the events, recorded at a paper speed of 25 millimeters per second and an amplitude of 2.5 mm/mvV) is shown in Figure 1. Repeated chest radiography at the ED showed appropriate device location, lead pin, and an absence of subcutaneous air trapping at the proximal and distal sense electrodes.Surface electrogram recorded by subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator from one of the events.

Reasoning: The patient is a 44-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent an uneventful implant of a subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) for secondary prevention.

Repeated chest radiography at the ED showed appropriate device location, lead pin, and an absence of subcutaneous air trapping at the proximal and distal sense electrodes.

The most likely cause of the patient's ventricular arrhythmias is her underlying dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes enlarged and weak, which can lead to arrhythmias. The patient's S-ICD was programmed with a conditional shock zone of 200 beats per minute and a shock zone of 230 beats per minute. This means that the device will deliver a shock if the patient's heart rate exceeds 200 beats per minute or if the patient's heart rate exceeds 230 beats per minute and there is evidence of ventricular fibrillation.

The surface electrogram from the events shows that the patient's heart rate was 220 beats per minute at the time of the shocks. This suggests that the patient's arrhythmias were likely due to her underlying dilated cardiomyopathy.

The next step in management is to reprogram the patient's S-ICD to a higher shock zone. This will prevent the device from delivering shocks for ventricular tachycardia that is not life-threatening. The patient should also be started on a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, to slow her heart rate and reduce the risk of arrhythmias.

The lesion waxed and waned but never completely healed; however, it greatly increased in size over 3 weeks before presentation. She reported constant, severe stabbing pain, right otalgia, and occasional swelling that caused oral dysphagia. She reported no constitutional symptoms or any history of tobacco or alcohol use. On examination, the mass was a 3 × 2-cm, exophytic and raised, plateaulike lesion on the right dorsolateral tongue with approximately 1 to 2 cm of surrounding induration (Figure, A).A, Right lateral tongue lesion at presentation. B, Spindled-cell proliferation with palisaded areas (Verocay bodies) and an associated inflammatory infiltrate with abundant eosinophils (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×20).A biopsy was obtained that demonstrated ulceration, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and abundant acute and chronic inflammation replete with eosinophils. The differential based on the biopsy included traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia and ulceration due to drug- or infection-related sources. In addition, the possibility of an unsampled submucosal mass with overlying ulceration was suggested by the pathologist who interpreted the biopsy findings.

The most likely diagnosis is schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction. Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors that are most commonly found in the head and neck region. They are typically slow-growing and painless, and they often present as a solitary mass. The diagnosis of schwannoma is usually made on the basis of clinical presentation and imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of schwannoma is typically surgical resection. The prognosis for patients with schwannoma is excellent, with most patients having a complete cure after surgery.

Title: Perforation of the Hard Palate Case is: A 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital following 3 weeks of dysphagia; 1 week of nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice; and a 25-pound weight loss over the preceding 2 months. He had been diagnosed a year earlier with HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. Baseline CD4 count was 7 cells/μL, and following treatment with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) consisting of dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, he achieved full virological suppression; however, CD4 counts remained low at 31 cells/μL. He had completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin—a liver-sparing regimen—owing to toxic effects from the first-line regimen 1 month prior to admission. Physical examination revealed evidence of perforation of the hard palate (Figure, A). A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy was performed (Figure, B and C).A, Clinical view of the perforation of the hard palate.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis. He has been diagnosed with dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice for 3 weeks, and a 25-pound weight loss for 2 months. His CD4 count is 31 cells/μL. He has completed 12 months of directly observed therapy with ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and rifabutin. Physical examination reveals evidence of perforation of the hard palate. A computed tomographic scan of the chest reveals necrotic lymph nodes. A palatine biopsy shows granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast bacilli.

The most likely diagnosis is tuberculosis of the palate. This is supported by the patient's history of HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis, his low CD4 count, the presence of necrotic lymph nodes on imaging, and the finding of granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast bacilli on biopsy.

Tertiary syphilis is a less likely diagnosis. This is a late-stage manifestation of syphilis that can cause a variety of systemic symptoms, including gummas, which are destructive lesions of the skin and other organs. However, tertiary syphilis is uncommon in HIV-infected patients.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that is endemic in certain parts of the United States. It can cause a variety of pulmonary and systemic symptoms, including granulomatous inflammation. However, histoplasmosis is less likely in a patient with HIV infection, who is more likely to have disseminated disease.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. It can affect any organ system, but is most commonly seen in the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin. However, sarcoidosis is less likely in a patient with HIV infection, who is more likely to have disseminated disease.

Title: Sudden-Onset Painless Blurry Vision Case is: A man in his late 30s with a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy presented for evaluation of sudden-onset painless blurry vision of the right eye. His ocular history included nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye requiring pars plana vitrectomy, panretinal photocoagulation, multiple treatments with intravitreous bevacizumab, and cataract extraction with placement of an intraocular lens (IOL) into the capsular bag approximately 4 years ago. At his routine follow-up visit 2 weeks prior, the proliferative diabetic retinopathy was quiescent, and his Snellen visual acuity was 20/20 OD with manifest refraction of −1.50 + 0.25 × 180. Examination of the anterior segment at that time was unremarkable.At his current visit, visual acuity with the previous correction had been reduced to 20/150. Repeated manifest refraction of the right eye was −4.00 + 1.50 × 166, resulting in a visual acuity of 20/25. Intraocular pressure of the right eye was 10 mm Hg by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Evaluation of the posterior segment, including dilated fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula, showed stability compared with previous results. Imaging of the anterior segment with OCT is shown in Figure 1. The anterior chamber did not appear shallow, and there was no cell or flare.Slitlamp photograph of the anterior segment (A) and optical coherence tomographic imaging of the lens–capsular bag complex (B) obtained at initial presentation (arrowheads show hyperdistention of the capsular bag with turbid fluid).Perform posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which is a condition that can lead to vitreous hemorrhage. The vitreous is a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. When it hemorrhages, blood can leak into the vitreous and obscure vision. In this case, the patient also has a posterior capsule tear, which is a hole in the back of the lens capsule. This can allow vitreous fluid to leak into the anterior chamber, which is the space between the cornea and the iris. This can cause inflammation and clouding of the cornea, which can further impair vision.

The best course of treatment for this patient is to perform a posterior capsulotomy as part of a pars plana vitrectomy. This procedure involves making a small incision in the sclera (the white of the eye) and then using a laser to create a hole in the posterior capsule. This allows the vitreous fluid to drain out of the eye and prevents further inflammation. The pars plana vitrectomy also allows the surgeon to remove any vitreous blood or debris that may be obscuring vision.

Title: Corneal Opacification Case is: A woman in her late 60s presented with progressive, painless blurring of vision in both eyes over the past 6 months. Medical history was significant for Sjögren syndrome, for which she was taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Ocular history was notable for neovascular age-related macular degeneration under good control with intravitreal injections in the right eye and intermediate dry age-related macular degeneration in the left eye. Family history was negative for corneal disease.On initial presentation to the clinic, the best-corrected visual acuity of the patient was 20/150 OD and 20/40 OS. She was found to have bilateral, gray-white, irregular, poorly circumscribed, linear and nummular central and peripheral corneal opacities, confined primarily to the subepithelium and focally to the underlying anterior stroma (Figure 1A). The epithelium itself and deeper corneal stroma were spared, and the remainder of her anterior segment and fundus examination results were within normal limits. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography documented deposition of hyperreflective material in the subepithelium with trace deposition in the anterior stroma (Figure 1B). Evaluation of the patient's children showed no evidence of corneal disease.A, Right eye gray-white, irregular, linear and nummular central and peripheral corneal opacities. The left eye had similar findings. B, Hyperreflective deposits in the subepithelium (black arrowhead) with trace deposit in the anterior stroma (white arrowhead).What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with Sjögren syndrome-associated corneal epithelial dystrophy (SCED). SCED is a chronic, progressive, bilateral corneal disease characterized by subepithelial corneal opacities, epithelial basement membrane thickening, and aberrant epithelial cell growth. The disease is typically seen in patients with Sjögren syndrome, but it can also occur in patients with other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The mainstay of treatment for SCED is topical cyclosporine, which has been shown to slow the progression of the disease and improve visual acuity. In some cases, penetrating keratoplasty may be necessary to restore vision.

Title: A Translucent Cystic Iris Lesion Case is: A boy in his teens with no significant medical history, ocular history, or recent trauma was referred by an ophthalmologist for mild photophobia and an iris lesion. The referring clinician initially suspected traumatic iridodialysis and vitreous prolapse. On ophthalmic evaluation, visual acuity was 20/20 OS, intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg OS, and slitlamp examination of the left eye demonstrated a clear, intrinsically vascularized, cystic lesion extending into the anterior chamber from the peripheral superonasal iris (Figure 1A). The base of the lesion was surrounded by iris atrophy and corectopia was noted. The remainder of the ocular examination was unremarkable. Examination of the right eye was also unremarkable.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a boy in his teens with no significant medical history, ocular history, or recent trauma who was referred by an ophthalmologist for mild photophobia and an iris lesion. The referring clinician initially suspected traumatic iridodialysis and vitreous prolapse. On ophthalmic evaluation, visual acuity was 20/20 OS, intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg OS, and slitlamp examination of the left eye demonstrated a clear, intrinsically vascularized, cystic lesion extending into the anterior chamber from the peripheral superonasal iris. The base of the lesion was surrounded by iris atrophy and corectopia was noted. The remainder of the ocular examination was unremarkable. Examination of the right eye was also unremarkable. Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy of the anterior segment demonstrated a large, cystic lesion incorporated in the iris of the left eye with a thickness of 2.2 mm and a maximum radial extent of 6.1 mm.

Given the patient’s excellent visual acuity and no documented evidence of growth, the lesion was initially monitored closely. One month after presentation, the patient developed worsening photophobia, and his visual acuity declined to 20/50 OS. The iris lesion was noted to have grown, with maximum thickness measuring 3.5 mm and with radial extension now involving the visual axis.

The next step in management would be to perform a laser cystotomy. This is a minimally invasive procedure that involves using a laser to create a small opening in the cyst, allowing the fluid to drain out. This can usually be done on an outpatient basis and is usually very effective in resolving the problem.

Title: Posterior Segment Mass in a Woman With a Subluxed Crystalline Lens Case is: A 72-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of a choroidal mass and subluxed crystalline lens in the right eye. The patient had a history of congestive heart failure, cleft lip surgery as an infant, and right eye amblyopia. She reported occasional floaters and flashes in the right eye but denied any ocular complaints in the left eye. On examination, her visual acuity measured 3/200 OD and 20/30 OS, stable compared with her baseline. Her intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Right eye slitlamp biomicroscopy showed an irregular pupil, aphakia, and a pigmented mass behind the temporal iris (Figure 1A). Ophthalmoscopic examination results revealed a subluxed white cataractous lens in the inferior vitreous base (Figure 1B). An evaluation of the left eye yielded normal results aside for a moderate cataract. B-scan ultrasonography results showed the 2 masses described previously; both were moderately reflective, oval, and separate from the wall of the eye. Ultrasonography biomicroscopy (UBM) confirmed that the temporal mass and the inferiorly subluxed lens were separate from the iris and ciliary body and were similar to each other in size, shape, and density.A, Anterior fundus photograph of the right eye shows a dark mass behind the pupil temporally. B, Fundoscopy of the same eye shows a white cataractous lens subluxed into the inferior vitreous base.Pars plana lensectomy to remove the subluxed lensMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbitsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient has a choroidal mass and a subluxed crystalline lens in the right eye. The choroidal mass is a potential threat to the patient's vision, and the subluxed lens is a cosmetic deformity. The patient's visual acuity is 3/200 in the right eye, which is significantly decreased. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, which is a risk factor for complications from surgery.

The options are:

A: Plaque radiotherapy. This is a treatment for choroidal tumors. It is not the best option for this patient because she has a history of congestive heart failure. The radiation therapy could worsen her heart condition.

B: Pars plana lensectomy to remove the subluxed lens. This is a surgical procedure to remove the lens from the eye. It is the best option for this patient because it will improve her vision and remove the cosmetic deformity.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This is a diagnostic test to evaluate the brain and orbits. It is not the best option for this patient because she has a choroidal mass, not a brain tumor.

D: Biopsy of the choroidal mass. This is a surgical procedure to remove a piece of the choroidal mass for examination under a microscope. It is not the best option for this patient because she has a history of congestive heart failure. The surgery could worsen her heart condition.

Title: A New Brain Mass in an Immunocompromised Woman Case is: A woman in her 30s presented with frequent falls, right-sided lower-extremity weakness, and intermittent confusion. She had a medical history significant for a renal transplant performed 4 years prior. She received induction with alemtuzumab and maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate. She was not on any antiviral therapies prior to presentation. On admission, the patient developed left eye pain and slurred speech. Physical examination revealed expressive aphasia, partial left abducens nerve palsy, decreased motor strength in her right upper and lower extremities, and right-sided pronator drift. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/μL (reference range, 4.5-11.0 K/μL), and a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of 547 U/L (reference range, 160-450 U/L). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 51 cells/μL (reference range, 0-5 cells/μL) with 92% lymphocytes, a glucose level of 76 mg/dL (reference range, 40-70 mg/dL), and a protein level of 136 mg/dL (reference range, 12-60 mg/dL). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed multifocal vasogenic edema around the left lentiform nuclei, left temporal occipital white matter, and right parietal white matter, with mass effect causing near complete effacement of the third ventricle and subsequent rightward midline shift. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions (Figure, A). A fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT demonstrated increased focal fluorodeoxyglucose activity throughout the brain only. The patient underwent a biopsy of the right posterior temporal lobe (Figure, B and C).A, Ring-enhancing lesions are visible.

A fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT demonstrated increased focal fluorodeoxyglucose activity throughout the brain only. The patient underwent a biopsy of the right posterior temporal lobe.

The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNSLD). PCNSLD is a rare but serious complication of solid organ transplantation, occurring in 1-5% of patients. It is a B-cell lymphoma that arises in the brain or spinal cord. The risk of PCNSLD is increased in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, particularly those who are receiving high-dose steroids.

The diagnosis of PCNSLD is based on clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results. The clinical presentation of PCNSLD is variable and can include headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and altered mental status. Imaging findings of PCNSLD are typically non-specific and can include multiple ring-enhancing lesions on CT or MRI. Biopsy of a brain lesion is the gold standard for diagnosis of PCNSLD. The biopsy specimen will show a B-cell lymphoma with features of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

The treatment of PCNSLD is challenging and often involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. The prognosis for patients with PCNSLD is poor, with a median survival of 12-18 months. However, with aggressive treatment, some patients can achieve long-term remission.

Title: Oral and Penile Lesions in a Young Man Case is: A 28-year-old man presented to the emergency department with diffuse oral lesions, fever, and nonproductive cough for 1 week. He was diagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) and discharged home with acyclovir. Two days later, he returned with worsening oral lesions, painful phonation, poor oral intake, odynophagia, and new painful penile lesions. He denied any abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, arthralgia, fatigue, vision changes, or skin rashes. He reported a similar episode of widespread oral lesions 18 months earlier that was less severe and self-resolving. He had no other medical conditions, took no medications, and was sexually monogamous with his wife, who was asymptomatic.The patient was hemodynamically stable and had a normal respiratory examination. He had a fever (39.4°C) on presentation, but his temperature abated overnight and he remained afebrile for the rest of the admission. His superior and inferior lips had extensive well-circumscribed erosions and ulcerations with erythematous edges, crusting, and a gray-white base (Figure, left). Lesions extended into the buccal mucosa and soft palate. His tongue was enlarged with fissures. A genital examination showed similar lesions on the penis, with scalloped borders (Figure, right). There were no skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly.Left, Extensive well-circumscribed oral lesions limited to the mucosa in a 28-year-old man. Right, Similar lesions with scalloped borders on the distal shaft and glans of the penis in the same patient.Results of laboratory tests from the emergency department were normal, and a chest radiograph showed no evidence of pneumonia. Results of further testing for antinuclear antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, HIV, HSV serology, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea were negative. Bacterial and viral cultures of the oral and penile lesions were also negative. Serum enzyme immunoassay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM was positive at 1280 U/mL.

A: Perform upper endoscopy and colonoscopy , B: Test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies , C: Prescribe oral azithromycin , D: Prescribe oral suspension nystatin. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of oral lesions that are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV). However, his current presentation is more severe and includes new painful penile lesions. In addition, he has fever, odynophagia, and poor oral intake. These findings are concerning for a more serious infection, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Answer: C

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia in young adults. It can also cause a variety of other symptoms, including pharyngitis, bronchitis, and skin rash. The diagnosis is made by serologic testing, which can detect antibodies to the organism. Treatment is with antibiotics, such as azithromycin.

A: Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are not indicated in this patient. The patient does not have any symptoms of upper gastrointestinal tract disease, and there is no evidence of bleeding or obstruction.

B: Anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies are not typically used in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. These antibodies are more commonly used in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.

D: Oral suspension nystatin is an antifungal medication. It is not effective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Title: Dilated Pupil in a Patient With Hyperhidrosis Case is: A 39-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after she noticed that her left pupil was dilated when looking in the mirror earlier in the day. She had a medical history of hypertension and palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. She denied double vision, ptosis, headache, and weakness. On examination, she appeared well and her blood pressure was 128/78 mm Hg; heart rate, 76/min; and respiratory rate, 13/min. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, there was no ptosis, and extraocular movements were full. Pupillary examination revealed anisocoria that was more pronounced in bright lighting conditions (Figure). The right pupil measured 6 mm in the dark and 3 mm in the light, whereas the left pupil measured 9 mm in the dark and 8 mm in the light. The left pupil was poorly reactive to light and to a near target. Slitlamp examination revealed normal-appearing anterior chambers without any signs of intraocular inflammation. Cranial nerve function was otherwise normal. The remainder of the neurologic examination revealed normal muscle tone, strength, reflexes, and gait.Patient’s pupil sizes shown in dim and bright lighting conditions.Order computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerveOrder magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out a brainstem strokePerform detailed review of systemic and topical medicationsPerform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndromeWhat Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis who presents with a new-onset left-sided dilated pupil. The anisocoria is more pronounced in bright lighting conditions, and the left pupil is poorly reactive to light and to a near target. The patient denies double vision, ptosis, headache, and weakness. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for a dilated pupil includes:

* Horner syndrome: This is a condition characterized by ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis. It can be caused by a variety of etiologies, including compression of the third cranial nerve (CN III), brainstem stroke, and medication side effects.
* Third cranial nerve palsy: This is a condition characterized by ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and diplopia. It can be caused by a variety of etiologies, including trauma, tumor, and aneurysm.
* Adie syndrome: This is a condition characterized by tonic pupils that are poorly reactive to light but react normally to near vision. It is usually idiopathic but can be caused by a variety of etiologies, including infection, trauma, and medication side effects.
* Medication side effects: A variety of medications can cause pupillary dilation, including anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, and tricyclic antidepressants.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of CN III. This is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms given her history of hypertension. If the CTA is negative, then a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain should be ordered to rule out a brainstem stroke. If both the CTA and MRI are negative, then a detailed review of the patient's systemic and topical medications should be performed to rule out any potential medication side effects. If no cause is found, then pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine can be performed to confirm Horner syndrome.

A punch biopsy from the left flank was obtained for hematoxylin-eosin staining, and a punch biopsy from the left leg was sent for tissue and fungal culture. Histopathological analysis was subsequently performed.

The most likely diagnosis is disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination. This is a rare but serious complication of disseminated candidiasis that occurs in immunocompromised patients. The characteristic skin lesions are pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core. The lesions are caused by the release of fungal elements from the bloodstream into the skin, where they trigger an inflammatory response. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination, which shows fungal hyphae within the epidermis and dermis.

The treatment for disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination is antifungal therapy. The choice of antifungal agent depends on the patient's underlying immune status and the sensitivity of the Candida species. In general, amphotericin B or fluconazole is used. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue.

Reasoning:

The patient presented with a 4-month history of widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques distributed symmetrically on her body, especially on the axillae (Figure 1A), anogenital region, inguinal skin, and both palms, with slight itching. The verrucous plaques also involved the conjunctiva, lips, and gingiva (Figure 1B). The patient had experienced a weight loss of 6 kg during the last 3 months. Within the last month, the patient’s thyroid became enlarged, and she developed anorexia and abdominal discomfort. Laboratory test results revealed remarkably elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen and carbohydrate antigen 242. Biopsy specimens of lesions on the axillae and lips both revealed a papillary structure with hyperkeratosis. An endoscopic examination and computed tomographic scan of the abdomen were performed.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with malignant acanthosis nigricans. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is a rare, acquired dermatosis characterized by the development of dark, velvety plaques on the skin. The lesions are typically distributed in areas of skin that are subjected to friction, such as the axillae, groin, and neck. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is associated with a number of underlying medical conditions, including internal malignancy, endocrine disorders, and medications. The most common underlying malignancy associated with malignant acanthosis nigricans is gastric adenocarcinoma.

In the patient described in the case, the presence of widespread, thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques, as well as the patient's history of weight loss, abdominal discomfort, and elevated tumor markers, is highly suggestive of malignant acanthosis nigricans. The biopsy specimens of lesions on the axillae and lips that revealed a papillary structure with hyperkeratosis provide further support for the diagnosis of malignant acanthosis nigricans.

The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management.

Laboratory test results at presentation included a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 84 fL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 mm/h, and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 412 IU/L. Hepatic and renal function levels were within normal limits. Complement levels were normal. Hepatitis B and C and HIV profiles were negative. A chest radiograph showed a 2-cm lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung. A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained.

The differential diagnosis for a generalized rash with pedal edema includes a number of conditions, including:

* Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica: This is a rare condition that is associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly lung cancer. It is characterized by a rash on the hands and feet, as well as nail changes.
* Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis: This is a type of vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including purpura, papules, and nodules.
* Purpura fulminans: This is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by widespread bleeding into the skin and other organs. It is most commonly seen in children with sepsis.
* Henoch-Schönlein purpura: This is a vasculitis that is most commonly seen in children. It is characterized by a rash on the lower extremities, joint pain, abdominal pain, and kidney problems.

In this case, the patient's age, gender, and smoking history are all risk factors for lung cancer. The presence of a chest mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on imaging is suggestive of lung cancer. The skin biopsy specimen showed evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a characteristic finding in cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Title: A Woman With Multiparity Experiencing Chest Pain in Her Early 60s Case is: A woman in her early 60s with a medical history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram (which demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities) approximately 1 year prior to presentation, hypertension, long-standing dyslipidemia, and multiparity presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. She also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. Her family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 (Figure, A). The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory.

Reasoning:
The patient in this case is a woman in her early 60s with a history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram approximately 1 year prior to presentation. She is now presenting with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. She also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. Her physical examination and laboratory test results are consistent with an acute myocardial infarction.

The most appropriate management for this patient is to revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and start medical therapy. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon into the narrowed coronary artery and inflating it to widen the artery. This allows blood to flow more easily to the heart muscle. Medical therapy includes aspirin, β-blockers, clopidogrel, and statins. Aspirin helps to prevent blood clots from forming. β-blockers help to lower blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Clopidogrel helps to prevent platelets from clumping together. Statins help to lower cholesterol levels.

Answer:
D. Revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention and start medical therapy.
D
api request failed
Reasoning: The patient is presenting with a STEMI, which is a medical emergency. The first step in treatment is to restore blood flow to the heart muscle. This can be done with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a procedure to insert a stent into the narrowed coronary artery. PCI is the preferred treatment for STEMI, as it has been shown to improve outcomes compared to medical therapy alone.

In addition to PCI, the patient should also be started on aspirin, a β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin. Aspirin is a blood thinner that helps to prevent blood clots. A β-blocker slows the heart rate and reduces blood pressure. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that helps to prevent blood clots. A statin is a medication that lowers cholesterol. These medications can help to reduce the risk of further heart problems.

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her early 60s with a medical history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram (which demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities) approximately 1 year prior to presentation, hypertension, long-standing dyslipidemia, and multiparity. She presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. She also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. Her family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5. The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography of the patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery was performed, and the findings are depicted in the figure.

The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is a major artery that supplies blood to the left ventricle of the heart. The LAD is typically divided into three segments: the proximal LAD, the mid-LAD, and the distal LAD. The proximal LAD is the longest segment and supplies blood to the anterior wall of the left ventricle. The mid-LAD supplies blood to the apex of the heart. The distal LAD supplies blood to the inferior wall of the left ventricle.

The angiogram shows that the patient has a 90% stenosis of the proximal LAD. A stenosis is a narrowing of an artery. A 90% stenosis is considered to be a critical stenosis, which means that it is likely to cause a heart attack.

The patient's symptoms and the findings on the angiogram are consistent with a diagnosis of STEMI. STEMI is a type of heart attack that occurs when a coronary artery is completely blocked. The blockage can be caused by a blood clot, a plaque rupture, or a combination of both.

The treatment for STEMI is to restore blood flow to the heart muscle. This can be done with either thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Thrombolytic therapy is a medication that dissolves blood clots. PCI is a procedure in which a balloon is inserted into the narrowed artery and inflated. This widens the artery and improves blood flow.

In this case, the patient should be treated with PCI. PCI is the preferred treatment for STEMI because it is more effective than thrombolytic therapy. PCI also has a lower risk of bleeding complications.

The patient should also be started on aspirin, a beta-blocker, and clopidogrel. These medications are used to prevent blood clots and to improve the long-term prognosis of the patient.

Biopsy results showed branching organisms superficial to squamous epithelium.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is nocardiosis. Nocardiosis is a rare, opportunistic infection caused by the gram-positive bacteria Nocardia. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with a history of organ transplantation. Nocardiosis can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. It can also cause skin lesions, meningitis, and brain abscesses.

The diagnosis of nocardiosis is made by culture of the organism from sputum, blood, or biopsy specimens. Treatment is with antibiotics, such as imipenem or meropenem. The prognosis for nocardiosis is variable, depending on the site of infection and the patient's immune status. With appropriate treatment, most patients recover. However, nocardiosis can be fatal, particularly in patients with severe underlying disease.

Title: Incidental Nasal Cavity Mass Identified During Preoperative Examination for Transsphenoidal Surgery Case is: An 80-year-old man with acromegaly due to a hypoenhancing pituitary microadenoma opted for transsphenoidal resection. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging examination of the sella revealed a left-sided pituitary microadenoma (Figure, A) and lobulated polypoid soft tissue masses in the superior nasal cavities arising from the olfactory clefts. These lesions demonstrated avid post–contrast enhancement with small areas of cystic change and heterogeneously hyperintense T2 signal. There was mild widening of the olfactory clefts, particularly on the left side (Figure, B). The intervening nasal septum was intact, and there was no intracranial extension. The patient did not have any noteworthy rhinological symptoms on review. He later underwent nasal endoscopy, and results showed tan-colored polypoid lesions emanating from the olfactory clefts of both nasal cavities (Figure, C). Biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands (Figure, D).A, An incidental polypoid-enhancing mass in the nasal cavity demonstrating avid post–contrast enhancement (yellow arrowheads) was observed on the magnetic resonance imaging examination.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is an 80-year-old man with acromegaly due to a hypoenhancing pituitary microadenoma who opted for transsphenoidal resection. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging examination of the sella revealed a left-sided pituitary microadenoma and lobulated polypoid soft tissue masses in the superior nasal cavities arising from the olfactory clefts. These lesions demonstrated avid post–contrast enhancement with small areas of cystic change and heterogeneously hyperintense T2 signal. There was mild widening of the olfactory clefts, particularly on the left side. The intervening nasal septum was intact, and there was no intracranial extension. The patient did not have any noteworthy rhinological symptoms on review. He later underwent nasal endoscopy, and results showed tan-colored polypoid lesions emanating from the olfactory clefts of both nasal cavities. Biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands.

The differential diagnosis for a polypoid mass in the nasal cavity includes inflammatory nasal polyps, inverted papilloma, low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma, and nasal cavity hamartoma. Inflammatory nasal polyps are the most common type of nasal polyp, and they are usually associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. Inverted papillomas are benign epithelial tumors that arise from the Schneiderian membrane, and they are often associated with chronic sinusitis and nasal obstruction. Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the epithelial lining of the sinonasal tract. Nasal cavity hamartomas are benign tumors that are composed of a mixture of tissues, including cartilage, bone, and fibrous tissue.

In this case, the patient's age, the location of the mass, the imaging findings, and the biopsy results are all consistent with a diagnosis of inverted papilloma. Inverted papillomas are most common in adults between the ages of 40 and 60 years, and they are more common in men than in women. They typically arise from the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and they can extend into the maxillary sinus, the ethmoid sinus, and the frontal sinus. On imaging, inverted papillomas are typically lobulated masses that enhance with contrast. Biopsy findings show a submucosal proliferation of bland-appearing epithelial cells.

The treatment for inverted papillomas is surgical excision. The goal of surgery is to remove the entire tumor with clear margins. In some cases, adjuvant therapy, such as radiation therapy, may be recommended.

**Answer:**

The correct answer is C. Inverted papilloma.

Title: Gaze-Provoked Exotropia in a Young Woman Case is: A 25-year-old woman was referred to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic because of a 6-month history of intermittent diplopia. The double vision occurred every day, multiple times throughout the day, and was provoked after looking to the right. There was no eye pain, headache, ptosis, difficulties swallowing, change in voice, or any other ocular or neurological symptoms.She had no history of strabismus, eye patching, or ocular surgery. Her medical history was notable for a growth hormone–producing pituitary macroadenoma for which she underwent surgical resection 2.5 years prior to presentation, followed by γ-knife radiosurgery (50 Gy) 6 months after the initial surgical procedure. She also had a history of congenital hip dysplasia. Medications included cabergoline, levothyroxine, ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone, and pasireotide.Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her pupils were equal in size with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Automated perimetry was full in both eyes. The anterior and posterior segments were normal in both eyes. There was no proptosis or ptosis. On initial examination, the eye movements were full, with no ocular deviation in primary, right, or lateral gazes. However, on returning to a primary gaze from a sustained right-gaze position, a large angle exotropia was present, and on attempted left gaze, there was a limitation of adduction of the right eye (Figure). After 10 to 15 seconds, the exotropia resolved, and eye movements returned to normal.A, Eye positions in right gaze, and B, eye positions in primary gaze. After sustaining a right gaze position for 10 to 15 seconds (A) and then returning to primary gaze (B), there is a large-angle right exotropia. Note that the pupils are pharmacologically dilated.What Would You Do Next? A: Initiate a trial of carbamazepine , B: Perform bilateral lateral rectus recessions , C: Order cranial magnetic resonance imaging , D: Obtain anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is a disorder of the brainstem that results in weakness of adduction of one eye in adduction. The weakness is caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the abducens nucleus (which controls abduction of the eye) to the medial rectus nucleus (which controls adduction of the eye). The lesion in INO is typically due to ischemia or demyelination of the MLF.

The patient's history of a growth hormone-producing pituitary macroadenoma is relevant because these tumors can compress the brainstem and cause INO. The patient's examination is also consistent with INO. She has a large-angle exotropia in right gaze, which is due to weakness of adduction of the right eye. The exotropia resolves after 10 to 15 seconds, which is consistent with the transient nature of INO.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to look for a lesion of the brainstem. If a lesion is found, the patient may need further testing, such as a lumbar puncture, to determine the cause of the lesion. Treatment of INO is generally supportive. The patient may be given prisms to help with double vision, and she may need to wear an eye patch over the affected eye. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the misalignment of the eyes.

Title: A Man With a Large Conjunctival Lesion Case is: A 27-year-old man presented to the clinic for evaluation of a mass in his right eye. He had an unremarkable medical and ocular history and had not sustained any ocular trauma. He described a painless, reddish mass in his lateral conjunctiva, which had been present since birth. He was asymptomatic aside from rare episodes of pink tears in his right eye, and the lesion did not bother him cosmetically. He noted no blurry vision, diplopia, or pain with eye movements. His visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and there was no proptosis, ptosis, or afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular muscle movements were intact, and his intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg OU. There was no change in lesion size observed with the Valsalva maneuver. A slitlamp examination revealed an 8-mm, round, fluctuant, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus (Figure). The results of the rest of the examinations, including cornea, anterior chamber, and dilated fundus examinations, were normal in both eyes.A vascular, multifocal mass (8 mm) involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus, as shown by slitlamp examination.Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbitsWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 27-year-old man with a large, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus. The lesion has been present since birth and is asymptomatic aside from rare episodes of pink tears. The patient has no history of ocular trauma or any other medical problems.

The differential diagnosis for a large, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva includes hemangioma, lymphangioma, and pyogenic granuloma. Hemangiomas are the most common type of vascular tumor in the pediatric population. They are typically benign and self-limited, but they can occasionally cause cosmetic problems or interfere with vision. Lymphangiomas are rare, benign tumors of lymphatic vessels. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. Pyogenic granulomas are benign, inflammatory tumors that can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the oral cavity and skin.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. This will help to determine the extent of the lesion and to rule out any other underlying causes, such as a brain tumor or an orbital cellulitis.

Title: Adolescent Boy With Choroidal Mass Case is: A boy aged 13 years was referred for choroidal mass of the right eye. Visual acutiy was 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures and anterior segment examination findings were normal. Fundus examination revealed orange, subretinal mass with associated subretinal fluid in the posterior pole. The lesion was followed closely and throughout a series of visits, the lesion and fluid continued to progress, the visual acuity worsened to 20/200, and the tumor mass extended closer to the fovea (Figure 1). The mass measured 15 mm in basal diameter with a thickness of 6.4 mm on B-scan ultrasonography.Large choroidal vascular mass of inferotemporal right choroid. Note large choroidal mass on B-scan ultrasonography.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a choroidal mass in the right eye. The lesion was initially followed closely, but it continued to progress, resulting in worsening visual acuity and extension of the tumor mass closer to the fovea. The mass measures 15 mm in basal diameter with a thickness of 6.4 mm on B-scan ultrasonography.

The most likely diagnosis is choroidal hemangioma, which is a benign tumor that can occur in children. Choroidal hemangiomas are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but they can occasionally cause visual problems if they grow large enough to encroach on the fovea.

The treatment of choroidal hemangioma is generally not necessary unless the tumor is causing visual problems. In cases where treatment is indicated, the goal is to shrink the tumor and improve vision. Treatment options include photodynamic therapy, iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy injections, and external beam radiotherapy.

Photodynamic therapy is a procedure that uses a laser to destroy the tumor cells. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is a procedure that uses a radioactive plaque to deliver radiation to the tumor. Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy injections are a type of treatment that uses drugs to block the growth of new blood vessels in the tumor. External beam radiotherapy is a procedure that uses high-energy radiation to destroy the tumor cells.

The best treatment option for the patient in this case is photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy is a minimally invasive procedure that is generally well-tolerated. It is also effective in shrinking choroidal hemangiomas and improving vision.

Title: Visual Field Loss in a Patient With Optic Disc Cupping Case is: A 52-year-old man was referred to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of visual field loss. He had exotropia and amblyopia of the left eye. He was diagnosed as having glaucoma 6 months prior to presentation owing to optic nerve cupping and visual field deficits on automated perimetry and was taking latanoprost. His medical history was significant for pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and his family history was notable for glaucoma in his grandmother. He was being treated by the neurology department for his pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency with thiamine, vitamin C, and oxaloacetate. His systemic symptoms included hyperhidrosis and episodes of hand tremors, ataxia, and dysarthria that occur every 2 to 3 years.Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 −2 OD and 20/100 +2 OS, with a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 16 mm Hg OU, and pachymetry was 611 μM OD and 592 μM OS (normal mean [SD], 542.4  [33.5] μM). He identified 8/8 OD and 3/8 OS Ishihara color plates. He had an exotropia with full range of motion in both eyes. His nuclear sclerotic cataracts were not consistent with visual acuity in both eyes; his anterior segment examination was otherwise within normal limits. His dilated examination was normal except for cupping and pallor in both eyes with a supratemporal optic nerve pit in the right eye. The optic discs and automated perimetry are shown  in the Figure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer showed a mean thickness of 64 μM OD and 47 μM OS (normal mean [SD], 97.3 [9.6] μM), and OCT of the macula showed perifoveal thinning with normal foveal thickness in both eyes.A and B, Fundus photographs show cupping with optic nerve pallor in both eyes and a supratemporal optic nerve pit in the right eye (arrowhead).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a genetic disorder that can cause optic nerve atrophy and visual field loss. He also has a family history of glaucoma. His current presentation, with optic nerve cupping, visual field deficits, and a relative afferent pupillary defect, is consistent with glaucoma. However, the presence of a supratemporal optic nerve pit in the right eye raises the possibility of a non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy, such as optic nerve infarction or demyelination. Given the patient's history and examination findings, it is important to obtain further imaging studies to evaluate the optic nerves and orbits. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the most appropriate test to order in this case. This will help to rule out any structural abnormalities that could be causing the patient's visual symptoms.

Title: A Febrile, Hypotensive Patient With Bilateral Lung Crackles Case is: A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness. His vital signs were temperature, 38.4°C (101.1°F); blood pressure, 94/40 mm Hg; heart rate, 116/min; and respiratory rate, 26/min. He was diaphoretic and had poor dentition. A soft S1 was present on cardiac examination, and crackles were auscultated in basilar lung fields bilaterally. Three sets of blood cultures from different sites were obtained. Cardiology, cardiac surgery, and infectious disease physicians were consulted. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained (Figure 1).Transesophageal echocardiogram obtained from the patient in diastole on the midesophageal long-axis view.What Would You Do Next? A: Order diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms , B: Perform emergency surgery for aortic valve repair , C: Place an intra-aortic balloon pump , D: Start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of hypertension and presents with fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness. His vital signs are significant for hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. On cardiac examination, he has a soft S1 and crackles in the basilar lung fields bilaterally. Blood cultures were drawn, and cardiology, cardiac surgery, and infectious disease physicians were consulted. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for a transesophageal echocardiogram. The transesophageal echocardiogram shows a dilated aortic root with a bicuspid aortic valve and severe aortic regurgitation.

Answer: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with acute aortic regurgitation. Acute aortic regurgitation is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent treatment. The goals of treatment are to reduce the left ventricular afterload, improve cardiac output, and prevent complications. Treatment options include diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic agents, and surgery.

Diuretics are used to reduce the left ventricular afterload. Vasodilators are used to improve cardiac output. Inotropic agents are used to increase the contractility of the left ventricle. Surgery is indicated for patients who have severe aortic regurgitation and are not responsive to medical therapy.

In this case, the patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires urgent treatment. The best option is to place an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). An IABP is a mechanical device that is inserted into the aorta and helps to improve cardiac output by increasing coronary perfusion and reducing left ventricular afterload. The IABP will provide the patient with temporary hemodynamic support while a definitive treatment, such as aortic valve replacement, is arranged.

A: Order diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms is not the best option because it will not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition, which is acute aortic regurgitation. Diuretics may be used to treat the patient's symptoms of pulmonary edema, but they will not improve his hemodynamic status. Serial echocardiograms may be helpful in monitoring the patient's condition, but they will not provide definitive treatment.

B: Perform emergency surgery for aortic valve repair is not the best option because the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Emergency surgery is associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity. The patient should be stabilized with medical therapy before undergoing surgery.

C: Place an intra-aortic balloon pump is the best option because it will provide the patient with temporary hemodynamic support while a definitive treatment, such as aortic valve replacement, is arranged. The IABP will help to improve the patient's cardiac output and reduce his risk of death.

Serum free light chains revealed normal κ free light chains, λ free light chains, and a normal κ/λ ratio. Immunofixation results revealed IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy. A punch biopsy was obtained for diagnostic clarification.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of scleromyxedema. Scleromyxedema is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse infiltration of the skin and subcutaneous tissues with mucin deposition. The disease typically affects middle-aged and older adults, with a female predominance. The cause of scleromyxedema is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The clinical presentation of scleromyxedema is variable, but the most common findings are diffuse skin thickening, papules, plaques, and nodules. The skin may be waxy or doughy in texture, and there may be associated joint pain, stiffness, and contractures. Other findings may include lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.

The diagnosis of scleromyxedema is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results. The skin biopsy typically shows diffuse infiltration of the dermis with mucin deposition. The laboratory findings may include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and a monoclonal gammopathy.

There is no cure for scleromyxedema, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes a combination of medications, such as corticosteroids, diuretics, and immunosuppressive agents. Physical therapy may also be helpful to improve range of motion and reduce joint pain.

Reasoning:

The patient is a man in his 60s with a 10-year history of a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on his left leg. He has a 16-year history of diabetes mellitus that is being treated with metformin. Hematological and biochemical test results were unremarkable. There is no history of another endocrine disorder or malignant neoplasm. There is no family history of similar cutaneous findings. Physical examination reveals reddish brown hyperkeratotic papules 1 to 10 mm wide on the front and back of the left leg from knee to ankle. The rest of the physical examination findings are unremarkable. Removal of the scales causes slight bleeding. A lesional skin biopsy was performed.

The differential diagnosis includes stucco keratoses, hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis, and Kyrle disease.

Stucco keratoses are small, asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic papules that typically occur on the palms and soles. They are thought to be caused by chronic irritation.

Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by small, hyperkeratotic papules on the extremities. The cause is unknown.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis is a chronic, progressive skin disorder characterized by small, hyperkeratotic papules on sun-exposed areas of the skin. It is caused by a mutation in the gene EVER1.

Kyrle disease is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by large, warty papules on the legs and trunk. It is caused by a mutation in the gene LRP6.

The patient's history, physical examination findings, and biopsy results are most consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.

Title: Recurrent Involuntary Contractions of the Face, Arm, and Leg in an Elderly Man Case is: A man in his 60s was evaluated in the epilepsy monitoring unit for various spells he had been having up to 5 times a day over the previous 8 months. He described transient episodes of expressive speech difficulties, paroxysmal dizziness, and involuntary nonsuppressible jerks of the right arm, which occurred without warning and were associated with mild disorientation. Video electroencephalography (EEG) captured the movements (Figure, A). They consisted of involuntary, synchronous contractions of the right face, arm, and leg that were sustained for a few seconds before muscle relaxation occurred (Figure, B and C; Video). The movements were not elicited by action or exertion. There was no epileptic abnormality that correlated with the movements on EEG, and head magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.A, Electroencephalogram (EEG) during the event (bipolar montage, 60-Hz filter, 7-uV/mm sensitivity). B, Patient position prior to the event. C, Patient position while experiencing an involuntary, sustained contraction of the right lower face, arm, and leg lasting almost 2 seconds before spontaneous resolution. The event took place during the time span marked with red vertical lines on the EEG and did not show a clear change from baseline rhythm. Muscle artifacts are seen prior to and during the event.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Myoclonus , B: Paroxysmal dyskinesia , C: Faciobrachial dystonic seizures , D: Tic disorder. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of recurrent involuntary contractions of the face, arm, and leg. The movements are not elicited by action or exertion, and there is no epileptic abnormality that correlates with the movements on EEG. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS).

FBDS is a rare, epileptic seizure disorder characterized by sudden, brief episodes of involuntary contractions of the face, arm, and leg. The movements are usually unilateral and occur on the side of the body opposite the seizure focus in the brain. FBDS can be difficult to diagnose, as the movements can mimic other neurological conditions, such as tics or dyskinesia. However, the presence of a clear-cut seizure focus on EEG is diagnostic of FBDS.

There is no cure for FBDS, but treatment can help to control the seizures. Medications such as carbamazepine and valproic acid can be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of seizures. In some cases, surgery may be an option to remove the seizure focus in the brain.

Title: Cystoid Macular Edema With Scattered Intraretinal Hemorrhages in a Persistently Red Eye Case is: A woman in her early 70s with a history of hypertension, Cushing disease status post–pituitary radiotherapy (1973), left sphenoid wing meningioma involving the left optic nerve and cavernous sinus status postsurgical debulking (2009), radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide followed by intravenous bevacizumab, and a single prior episode of deep venous thrombosis presented with 2 months of eye redness and decreased vision in her right eye. She previously received a diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis at an outside institution and was treated with topical prednisolone acetate without improvement before presenting to our institution. On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and hand motions OS. A relative afferent pupillary defect was present on the left in the setting of left optic atrophy from the patient’s locally invasive meningioma. Confrontational visual fields were otherwise full in the right eye. Intraocular pressures were within normal limits in both eyes. Hertel exophthalmometry was notable for 3 mm of proptosis on the right. Slitlamp examination demonstrated 3 to 4+ meibomian gland dysfunction in both eyes, but with prominent conjunctival injection in the right eye only. Dilated funduscopy revealed scattered intraretinal hemorrhages (IRHs) and cystoid macular edema (CME) in the right eye, which was also seen on optical coherence tomography (Figure 1). Vital signs, complete blood cell count, and the results of thyroid function tests were within reference ranges. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and orbits with and without contrast showed a stable size of the meningioma and were otherwise normal.A, Color fundus photograph of the right eye showing scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and a blunted foveal light reflex.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with cystoid macular edema (CME) secondary to her left sphenoid wing meningioma. CME is a common complication of meningiomas, and it is thought to be caused by increased permeability of the blood-retinal barrier. The treatment for CME secondary to a meningioma is typically intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels, and it is thought to play a role in the development of CME. Intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent can reduce the production of VEGF and help to improve vision.

**Answer:** A) Perform an intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
**Reasoning:**
The patient's history of hypertension, Cushing disease, left sphenoid wing meningioma, and previous deep venous thrombosis puts her at increased risk for retinal vascular occlusion. The presence of scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cystoid macular edema in the right eye, as well as the stability of the meningioma on imaging, suggests that the patient's current symptoms are most likely due to a retinal vascular occlusion. Intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent (anti-VEGF) is the standard of care for the treatment of retinal vascular occlusion. Anti-VEGF agents work by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels, which can help to reduce the inflammation and edema associated with retinal vascular occlusion.

Title: An Elderly Woman With Progressive Diplopia Case is: A 75-year-old woman was referred to the ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of double vision and a droopy left upper eyelid. Over the previous 5 months, the patient had experienced gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. There were no neurological deficits and no pain. Her symptoms were constant, without fluctuation during the day. There was no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. Her medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history was positive for hypertension in her mother, prostate cancer in her father, and ductal carcinoma in situ in her daughter. She was a current daily smoker at presentation. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. Abduction was severely restricted in the left eye, but it did not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements were otherwise full. There was substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, was noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 was 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left. A 3.5-mm left enophthalmos was noted compared with the right side, and there was hollowing of the left superior sulcus.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with progressive diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. The diplopia is binocular and horizontal, and the ptosis is more severe on the left side. The patient has no neurological deficits or pain. Her symptoms are constant and have been present for 5 months. There is no history of trauma or prior surgery of the eye. The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Family history is positive for hypertension, prostate cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ. The patient is a current daily smoker.

The physical examination reveals visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupillary, intraocular pressure, and dilated fundus examinations are unremarkable. Abduction is severely restricted in the left eye, but it does not elicit pain, and extraocular muscle movements are otherwise full. There is substantial resistance to retropulsion of the left eye. Bilateral blepharoptosis, with more severity on the left side, is noted. The margin-to-reflex distance 1 is 2 mm on the right and 0 mm on the left. A 3.5-mm left enophthalmos is noted compared with the right side, and there is hollowing of the left superior sulcus. Testing of cranial nerves V and VII are unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, orbital tumors, and microvascular ischemic optic neuropathy. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle weakness. Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the tissues around the eye. Orbital tumors are masses that can grow in the orbit, the space around the eye. Microvascular ischemic optic neuropathy is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve due to poor blood flow.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast. This test will help to identify any masses or other abnormalities in the orbit. If the computed tomographic scan is normal, the next step would be to order testing for myasthenia gravis. This testing may include a Tensilon test, a blood test for antibodies to acetylcholine receptors, and an electromyography test. If the testing for myasthenia gravis is negative, the next step would be to order testing for thyroid eye disease. This testing may include a thyroid function test, an orbital ultrasound, and a CT scan of the orbits with contrast. If the testing for thyroid eye disease is negative, the next step would be to order testing for orbital tumors. This testing may include an MRI of the orbits, a CT scan of the orbits with contrast, and a biopsy of the orbital mass. If the testing for orbital tumors is negative, the next step would be to order testing for microvascular ischemic optic neuropathy. This testing may include an ophthalmologic examination, a visual field test, and an optic nerve sheath diameter measurement.

Title: An Unusual Corneal Mass Case is: A 74-year-old man was referred to the ocular oncology clinic for a right eye corneal mass. He had a history of herpetic keratitis and cataract surgery 2 years prior, both in the right eye, complicated by postoperative bullous keratopathy without treatment. The patient noted a corneal scar after the cataract surgery that gradually thickened over the ensuing 6 months. In our office, his examination in the right eye was notable for hand motion visual acuity and a pearly white, raised, 10 × 10-mm, gelatinous, corneal lesion with both intrinsic and feeder vessels (Figure 1A). There was no view of the anterior segment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a hyperechoic opacity on the surface of the cornea, with maximal thickness of 1.5 mm. A cleft was noted between the lesion and the cornea (Figure 1B). There was no extension posteriorly into the anterior chamber, iris, or ciliary body.A, Slitlamp external photograph of right-eye corneal lesion showing prominent elevation and both intrinsic and feeder vessels.

**Reasoning:**

The patient has a history of herpetic keratitis and cataract surgery, both in the right eye, complicated by postoperative bullous keratopathy without treatment. He now has a pearly white, raised, 10 × 10-mm, gelatinous, corneal lesion with both intrinsic and feeder vessels. There is no view of the anterior segment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a hyperechoic opacity on the surface of the cornea, with maximal thickness of 1.5 mm. A cleft was noted between the lesion and the cornea. There was no extension posteriorly into the anterior chamber, iris, or ciliary body.

The differential diagnosis for this lesion includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, including epithelial inclusion cyst, keratoacanthoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and sebaceous carcinoma. The most likely diagnosis is a sebaceous carcinoma, given the patient's history of herpetic keratitis and the characteristic clinical appearance of the lesion.

Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare but aggressive malignancy that can occur in the skin or the eye. The most common site of intraocular sebaceous carcinoma is the eyelids, but it can also occur in the conjunctiva, cornea, and sclera. The diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma is often made after excisional biopsy, although incisional biopsy may be performed in some cases.

The treatment of sebaceous carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, local therapy with 5-fluorouracil or cryotherapy may be effective. In more advanced disease, surgical excision with or without adjuvant radiation therapy may be necessary.

In this case, the patient has a large, aggressive lesion with a high risk of metastasis. The best treatment option is likely to be excisional biopsy with adjuvant radiation therapy.

Title: Pruritic Rash in a Woman With Hodgkin Lymphoma Case is: A 31-year-old gravida 1, para 1 woman with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White disease and recently diagnosed stage II Hodgkin lymphoma presented with a pruritic rash. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at 35 weeks’ gestation, and 1 week later she underwent cesarean delivery. At 3 weeks’ postpartum, she began chemotherapy (cycle 1, day 1) with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD). On day 15 of cycle 1, she presented with linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on her arms, back, and legs. Intense, diffuse pruritus had developed within 24 hours of the patient’s first day of treatment, and her symptoms were poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. Pruritus was followed by the appearance of dark scratch marks as demonstrated in the Figure. Laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 1.6 ×103 cells/mm3, with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and a total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104), which was unchanged from the baseline total bilirubin.Clinical photograph of the patient’s back shows scratch marks that appeared after diffuse pruritus.Prior to the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, she was receiving routine prenatal care, and the only complication was pruritus without a rash that developed during the first trimester. She was evaluated for right supraclavicular adenopathy that was unresponsive to antibiotics during the third trimester. Findings from a lymph node biopsy were consistent with classic Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis subtype. Staging imaging revealed bilateral supraclavicular jugular chain, paratracheal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm/h. She was diagnosed with stage II, unfavorable-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient's history of Hodgkin lymphoma and recent chemotherapy with bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) are consistent with the diagnosis of bleomycin toxic effects. Bleomycin is a known cause of skin toxicity, including pruritus, rash, and hyperpigmentation. The patient's symptoms developed within 24 hours of her first day of treatment, which is also consistent with a drug reaction. The patient's white blood cell count and total bilirubin were normal, which makes paraneoplastic skin disease and polymorphic eruption of pregnancy less likely. Vinblastine toxic effects can also cause skin toxicity, but the patient's rash is not typical of vinblastine toxicity.

The patient’s CD4 cell count was 141/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), and his HIV load was 504 473 copies/mL. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathologic examination.

The histopathologic examination showed infiltration with lymphoid cells and few histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissue. On immunohistochemical analysis, these cells showed nuclear positivity for c-Myc.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a rare, aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by a high proliferation of cells with a characteristic chromosomal translocation involving the c-Myc gene. It is most common in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. The disease is typically disseminated at diagnosis, with involvement of the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.

The patient in this case presented with a typical clinical picture of Burkitt lymphoma, with painless swelling of the left upper limb and nodules on the left side of the chest and abdomen. The histopathologic examination showed infiltration with lymphoid cells and few histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissue, and the immunohistochemical analysis showed nuclear positivity for c-Myc. These findings are diagnostic of Burkitt lymphoma.

Title: New-Onset Heart Failure Case is: An adult with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted to the cardiac unit with progressive shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and tachycardia, which had developed during several days. He had no history of drug use or cardiac events. On physical examination, he had warm extremities. His body temperature was 36.8°C. His blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate was 130 beats/min, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and pulse oximetry was 98% on ambient air. There were bibasilar rales on lung auscultation. The heart sounds were normal, and bilateral ankle edema was present. Laboratory tests revealed hyponatremia (sodium, 124 mEq/L [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1]), a compensated metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate concentration of 14 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1), and a lactate concentration of 82.0 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111). The D-dimer level was 0.0003 μg/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476), and the pro–brain-type natriuretic peptide level was 6062 pg/mL (to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1). The electrocardiogram on presentation is shown in the Figure. Echocardiography (Video 1 and Video 2) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%.What Would You Do Next? A: Start extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy , B: Administer intravenous β-blocker therapy , C: Administer intravenous bicarbonate therapy , D: Administer intravenous thiamine therapy. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with new-onset heart failure. He has hyponatremia, a compensated metabolic acidosis, and a lactate concentration of 82.0 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-segment changes. Echocardiography reveals a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. These findings are consistent with alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a form of heart failure that is caused by chronic alcohol abuse. It is characterized by a decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction, which is the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. The decrease in ejection fraction leads to symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and feet.

The treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is aimed at reducing the patient's alcohol intake and improving their heart function. This may include medications, such as beta-blockers and diuretics, as well as lifestyle changes, such as exercise and a healthy diet. In some cases, a heart transplant may be necessary.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and he is at risk of developing complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias. Therefore, the next step in management is to start him on intravenous beta-blocker therapy. Beta-blockers are medications that help to slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure. They can also improve the function of the left ventricle.

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her 30s who presented with a 1-year history of a painless, slowly enlarging, midline neck mass without associated dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, or history of infection. The mass was soft, mobile, and compressible in midline level IA, measuring 7 cm and posterior-superiorly displacing the tongue. The mass was visible as a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth and was nontender. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck with IV contrast was performed (Figure). The patient was taken to the operating room for a successful combined intraoral and transcervical approach to excision.

The most likely diagnosis is a simple ranula. Ranulas are common benign lesions that arise from the sublingual salivary gland ducts. They are typically soft, fluctuant, and blue-colored. They can occur anywhere in the floor of the mouth, but they are most common in the midline. Ranulas are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause discomfort if they become large or infected.

The diagnosis of a ranula is usually made on clinical grounds. However, a CT scan can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of a neck mass, such as an abscess or a tumor.

The treatment for a simple ranula is surgical excision. The ranula can be removed either through an intraoral or a transcervical approach. The intraoral approach is the most common and is usually performed under local anesthesia. The transcervical approach is more invasive and is usually reserved for larger ranulas or those that are not amenable to intraoral excision.

The prognosis for a simple ranula is excellent. The vast majority of patients are cured with surgical excision.

Title: Facial Cellulitis and Sinonasal Necrotizing Infection in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A 36-year-old otherwise healthy white woman with a history of chronic sinusitis presented with progressive left facial pain and swelling of 5 months’ duration. Associated symptoms included epistaxis and left-sided epiphora. Prior to presentation, she had been treated as an outpatient with multiple rounds of oral antibiotics and steroids for presumed sinusitis without improvement. Social history included routine cocaine use 10 years ago. Physical examination demonstrated substantial erythema and edema of the left infraorbital region and left nasal sidewall and purulent nasal secretions (Figure 1A). Endoscopic nasal examination revealed substantial swelling of the left nasal vestibule completely obstructing the left naris, swelling of the left nasolacrimal duct orifice, nearly total septal perforation with areas of necrotic bone, and no identifiable intranasal landmarks except for a remnant of the left middle turbinate (Figure 1B). There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 12 300/μL with normal neutrophil count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 83 mm/h; and a C-reactive protein level of 134 mg/L. (To convert white blood cells to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; C-reactive protein to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524.)

Reasoning:
The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of chronic sinusitis who presents with progressive left facial pain and swelling of 5 months’ duration.

A maxillofacial computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated cartilaginous and anterior osseous nasal septal perforation and left nasal and preseptal soft-tissue thickening with associated periosteal reaction of the nasal process of the maxilla.

The most likely diagnosis is cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion (CMDL). CMDL is a rare, destructive, inflammatory condition of the nasal septum that is associated with cocaine use. It is characterized by progressive necrosis of the nasal septum, which can lead to septal perforation, loss of intranasal landmarks, and extension of infection to surrounding structures. The diagnosis of CMDL is made clinically and confirmed by CT imaging. Treatment of CMDL includes cessation of cocaine use, antibiotics, and surgical debridement of necrotic tissue.

The other possible diagnoses are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL), and chronic invasive fungal sinusitis (CIFS). GPA is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the nose and sinuses. It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the blood vessels. ENKTL is a rare, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can occur in the nose and sinuses. It is characterized by the proliferation of natural killer/T-cells. CIFS is a fungal infection of the nose and sinuses that can occur in immunocompromised patients. It is characterized by the growth of fungi in the nasal mucosa and sinuses.

The patient in this case has a history of cocaine use, which is a risk factor for CMDL. The patient also has clinical features that are consistent with CMDL, including progressive necrosis of the nasal septum, septal perforation, loss of intranasal landmarks, and extension of infection to surrounding structures. The CT scan findings are also consistent with CMDL. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is CMDL.

Title: Fever, Rash, and Migratory Polyarthralgias Case is: A 24-year-old woman who worked on a farm in Connecticut developed fever, chills, vomiting, and a truncal maculopapular rash 3 weeks before presentation. One week after symptom onset, she remained febrile (maximum temperature, 39.6°C [103.2°F]) and the rash spread to her palms and soles, with some progression to pustules (Figure, left panel). She developed right knee pain, followed by pain in other joints. Two weeks after symptom onset, she presented to a local emergency department, reporting inability to stand due to severe joint pain. Results of tests for sexually transmitted infections and respiratory viruses were negative. She was presumptively diagnosed with a viral illness and discharged home with supportive care. Approximately 3 weeks after symptom onset, she presented to the emergency department again with persistent fever, worsening arthralgia, back pain, and progressive purpuric and pustular rash. Her vital signs were unremarkable. White blood cell count was 12 100/μL (reference range, 4000/μL-10 000/μL), with 84% neutrophils. Urinalysis results and levels of serum electrolytes and liver enzymes were within normal limits. Gram stain of blood culture is shown in the Figure (right panel).Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and culturesWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is a bacterial infection of a joint that can cause fever, chills, joint pain, and swelling. The most common cause of septic arthritis is Staphylococcus aureus, but other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, can also cause the infection.

The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions. However, the presence of neutrophils suggests that the patient's infection is bacterial in origin.

The Gram stain of the blood culture shows Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is consistent with a diagnosis of S. aureus.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures. This will allow the identification of the specific bacteria causing the infection and the selection of the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with an enlarging, immobile, painless mass in her right gluteal area. She had no other associated symptoms. On examination, she had a large, palpable, nontender right gluteal mass. She had no neurovascular deficits. Results of laboratory studies were within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an 11-cm heterogeneous lipomatous tumor involving the right gluteal musculature.

The most likely diagnosis is a lipoma, which is a benign tumor of fat cells. Lipomas are common, accounting for up to 2% of all soft tissue tumors. They are typically slow-growing and painless, and they rarely cause any problems. However, large lipomas can be cosmetically disfiguring, and they can also compress nearby nerves or blood vessels.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a tissue diagnosis. This can be done with an incisional biopsy, a core needle biopsy, or fine needle aspiration. An incisional biopsy is the most accurate method for obtaining a tissue diagnosis, but it is also the most invasive. A core needle biopsy is less invasive than an incisional biopsy, but it is not as accurate. Fine needle aspiration is the least invasive method for obtaining a tissue diagnosis, but it is also the least accurate.

In this case, I would recommend an incisional biopsy. This is because the patient has a large, enlarging mass that is causing her some cosmetic concern. An incisional biopsy will allow me to obtain a tissue diagnosis and to determine the extent of the tumor. This information will help me to determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

Title: Vesicles and Bullae on the Right Cheek, Neck, and Both Hands Case is: A man in his 40s was admitted to the hospital with a 10-day history of edema and presented with vesicles and bullae on his right cheek, neck, back, both eyelids, and the dorsal surface of his hands (Figure 1A). Prior to presentation, he had been treated for herpes zoster with famciclovir for 1 week, during which the lesions kept developing and were accompanied with irregular fever (maximum temperature, 39°C). Physical examination revealed edema on both eyelids; multiple papules, blisters, and crusted erosions with thin exudation on his right cheek and neck; and erythematous plaques and tense blisters and bullae on his back and on the dorsal surface of both hands (Figure 1B). A full laboratory workup was performed for autoantibodies for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus, and bullous pemphigoid; skin and bone-marrow biopsies and direct immunofluorescence were performed; and immunohistochemichal analysis, a swab of exudation, and bacterial, fungal, and atypical mycobacterial cultures from blood and tissue were also examined.A, Edema on both eyelids; multiple papules, blisters, and crusted erosions with thin exudation on right cheek and neck.

Reasoning: The patient presented with vesicles and bullae on his right cheek, neck, back, both eyelids, and the dorsal surface of his hands. He had been treated for herpes zoster with famciclovir for 1 week, during which the lesions kept developing and were accompanied with irregular fever. Physical examination revealed edema on both eyelids; multiple papules, blisters, and crusted erosions with thin exudation on his right cheek and neck; and erythematous plaques and tense blisters and bullae on his back and on the dorsal surface of both hands. A full laboratory workup was performed for autoantibodies for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus, and bullous pemphigoid; skin and bone-marrow biopsies and direct immunofluorescence were performed; and immunohistochemichal analysis, a swab of exudation, and bacterial, fungal, and atypical mycobacterial cultures from blood and tissue were also examined.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that most commonly affects older adults. The disease is characterized by the formation of tense blisters and bullae on the skin and mucous membranes. The blisters are caused by the immune system attacking the basement membrane zone, which is the area between the epidermis and the dermis.

The patient's laboratory workup was significant for the presence of autoantibodies to the basement membrane zone. These autoantibodies are diagnostic of bullous pemphigoid. The skin and bone-marrow biopsies also showed evidence of inflammation and damage to the basement membrane zone.

The patient was treated with oral prednisone, which resulted in a significant improvement in his condition. The blisters and bullae resolved, and the patient's fever and other symptoms resolved. The patient was able to be discharged from the hospital and is currently receiving outpatient treatment with prednisone.

Title: Violaceous Nodules in an Annular Configuration Encircling an Orthotopic Liver Transplant Scar Case is: A man in his 50s presented with an abdominal skin eruption of 2 days’ duration. His medical history included hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing (Figure 1A). A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C) and bacterial and fungal cultures.A, Confluent, indurated, violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the well-healed orthotopic liver transplant incisional scar.

Title: Strokelike Episodes in a Patient With Chronic Gait Abnormalities Case is: A 13-year-old boy with a longstanding history of gait imbalance presented with 2 episodes of acute-onset left hemibody weakness and dysarthria without changes in sensorium in a 24-hour period. Symptoms lasted approximately 60 minutes each before completely resolving; prior to the day of the events, he had never experienced similar phenomena. Initial examination following the second event revealed mild-to-moderate dysarthria, pes planovalgus and tight achilles tendons bilaterally, and decreased vibratory and fine touch sensation from the great toe up to the mid shin bilaterally. Reflexes were absent at the patella and achilles bilaterally. Bilateral dorsiflexion weakness was present (4 of 5). There were otherwise no motor deficits, muscle atrophy, or lateralizing neurologic abnormalities.On arrival, the patient underwent a stroke/transient ischemic attack workup. Results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a coagulation panel were within normal limits. Computed tomography angiogram demonstrated no evidence of extra or intracranial dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without contrast (Figure) demonstrated symmetric, bilateral, restricted diffusion, with T2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter and corpus callosum. Lumbar puncture was obtained and revealed normal cell counts and no oligoclonal bands or evidence of infection.A, Diffusion-weighted imaging sequence demonstrating bilateral, symmetric, restricted diffusion of the supratentorial white matter (corresponding hypointensity noted on apparent diffusion coefficient sequences). B, T2 sequence demonstrating bilateral and symmetric increased signal in the supratenorial white matter–sparing U-fibers.

Fluorescein angiography results revealed multiple hyperfluorescent lesions in late frames.

The most likely diagnosis is neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis is a late-stage complication of syphilis that can affect the brain, spinal cord, and eyes. It is caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. The most common symptoms of neurosyphilis are headache, fever, and changes in mental status. Other symptoms may include seizures, meningitis, and cranial nerve palsies. Neurosyphilis can also cause visual problems, including optic neuritis, retinal vasculitis, and chorioretinitis.

The treatment for neurosyphilis is intravenous penicillin G. The recommended dose is 2.4 million units every 4 hours for 10-14 days. In some cases, oral penicillin G may be used as an alternative.

The patient in this case should be treated with intravenous penicillin G. The dose should be 2.4 million units every 4 hours for 10-14 days. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of improvement or worsening of his vision.

Title: Bilateral Papilledema and Partially Empty Sella in a Woman in Her 30s Case is: A woman in her 30s was referred for evaluation of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. She denied any other neurologic symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and paresis. She had a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition had been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement.Her best-corrected visual acuity was no light perception OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mm Hg OD and 19 mm Hg OS. Fundus examination revealed papilledema in both eyes (Figure 1A). No obvious sign of optic disc ischemia or active uveitis was observed by fundus fluorescein angiography bilaterally. Humphrey visual fields showed complete visual field loss in the right eye and peripheral visual field defects in the left eye. Her anterior segment was normal in both eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable.

Reasoning:
The patient has bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. She has a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition has been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD had been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement.

The most likely cause of her visual loss is optic nerve compression due to a mass lesion in the sella turcica. The partially empty sella on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions, including BD.

The next step in the evaluation is to obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomographic venography (CTV) to rule out a vascular lesion, such as a cavernous hemangioma or arteriovenous malformation. If these studies are negative, then the next step would be to perform catheter cerebral angiography.

Answer:
C. Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography.

Title: A Young Girl With Bilateral Atypical Epiretinal Membranes Case is: An 8-year-old girl was referred to the vitreoretinal service for evaluation of bilateral macular lesions noted by her pediatric ophthalmologist. Bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession for exotropia was performed 4 years before this presentation. Medical history was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was born full term after a normal pregnancy and delivery, with normal growth assessments. The patient was performing well in school.On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/40 OS, which was stable from previous visits. Her pupils were round and reactive. There was a residual intermittent exotropia of 4 prism diopters bilaterally. Findings on slitlamp examination of the anterior segment were unremarkable. A single, 1-cm, oval, lightly pigmented macule with irregular borders was noted on her right upper arm. Dilated fundus examination revealed eccentric, yellow-clear, preretinal lesions in the maculas of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective areas on the surface of the macula with a spiculated appearance, projecting anteriorly into the vitreous. There was an increase in retinal thickness and loss of the foveal contour in both eyes (Figure).Optical coherence tomography of the right eye (A) showing an atypical epiretinal membrane with anterior projection into the vitreous and hazy borders and the left eye (B) showing a similar epiretinal membrane with mild anterior projection and hazy borders.Obtain a family medical history and genetic testingRecommend pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peelWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: Conjunctival Lesion in an Elderly Woman Case is: A woman in her mid-80s presented with ptosis and blurred vision in the right eye. The ptosis was first noticed 3 weeks prior to presentation and had gradually worsened. She denied any acute changes in her health and review of her systems was unremarkable. The patient had an ocular history of bilateral cataract surgery in 2016, a medical history of thyroid cancer with thyroidectomy in 1990, and stage IIIc lobular carcinoma of the right breast with mastectomy of the right breast in 2008.On examination, her visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/30 OS. Pupils were equal in size and reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressures were 21 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Assessment of the extraocular motility demonstrated moderate limitation to up gaze of the right eye and full ductions of the left eye. External examination confirmed right upper eyelid ptosis without substantial proptosis. On slitlamp examination, eversion of the right upper eyelid revealed a solid, superior bulbar conjunctival mass measuring 10 mm in diameter (Figure 1A). B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated an extraconal, noncompressible lesion of orbital tissue (Figure 1B). A computed tomographic scan showed nonspecific, increased soft-tissue density in the superior and anterior orbit.A, External photograph of the right eye demonstrating an elevated conjunctival lesion.

Title: A Middle-aged Man With Alcoholism and a Nonhealing Corneal Ulcer Case is: A 53-year-old male was referred for evaluation of a nonhealing corneal ulcer. He had not received medical care in 20 years and had no known medical diagnoses, but his social history was notable for consumption of approximately 12 alcoholic beverages per day. His ocular history was notable for left-eye enucleation from recent trauma. He initially presented to his local ophthalmologist with right eye redness, pain, and photophobia for 1 week. He was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer. Bacterial (aerobic and anaerobic) and fungal cultures were obtained, and the patient started receiving topical moxifloxacin. The cultures were negative after 1 week, but the patient did not demonstrate signs of clinical improvement. A complete blood cell count, metabolic panel, and serum test results (for antinuclear antibodies, peripheral antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies,  rheumatoid factor, and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide) were unremarkable. On referral, his visual acuity was 20/100 OD, and his intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg. Anterior examination revealed a diffusely hazy cornea with a blunted light reflex. A large, well-demarcated epithelial defect with substantial underlying stromal loss was seen in the inferonasal periphery (Figure). The stroma was 40% thinned without infiltrate. The epithelium was heaped up along the lesion borders. Corneal sensation was diminished. The conjunctiva demonstrated hyperemia, which was more prominent around the corneal lesion, although there was no discharge. A dilated ophthalmoscopic examination was unremarkable. Repeated bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained.An external photograph showing a large, well-demarcated epithelial defect with underlying stromal loss.Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection testsBroaden antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and tobramycinWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a nonhealing corneal ulcer. He has a history of alcoholism and left-eye enucleation. The ulcer is not responding to topical moxifloxacin. The patient's visual acuity is 20/100 OD, and his intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg. Anterior examination reveals a diffusely hazy cornea with a blunted light reflex. A large, well-demarcated epithelial defect with substantial underlying stromal loss is seen in the inferonasal periphery. The stroma is 40% thinned without infiltrate. The epithelium is heaped up along the lesion borders. Corneal sensation is diminished. The conjunctiva demonstrates hyperemia, which is more prominent around the corneal lesion, although there is no discharge. A dilated ophthalmoscopic examination is unremarkable. Repeated bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained.

The differential diagnosis for a nonhealing corneal ulcer includes bacterial keratitis, fungal keratitis, herpes simplex virus keratitis, and neurotrophic keratitis. The patient's history of alcoholism and left-enucleation puts him at increased risk for neurotrophic keratitis. Neurotrophic keratitis is a corneal ulcer that occurs due to damage to the corneal nerves. This damage can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes, trauma, and medications.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with neurotrophic keratitis. The diffusely hazy cornea with a blunted light reflex, the large, well-demarcated epithelial defect with substantial underlying stromal loss, and the diminished corneal sensation are all characteristic findings of neurotrophic keratitis.

The next step in management is to obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of neurotrophic keratitis. If herpes simplex virus is the cause of the ulcer, the patient will need to be treated with antiviral medications.

In addition to antiviral medications, the patient will also need to be treated with artificial tears and/or ointment to keep the cornea moist. The patient may also need to be fitted with a bandage contact lens to protect the cornea.

If the patient does not respond to treatment with antiviral medications and artificial tears/ointment, the patient may need to have a corneal transplant. A corneal transplant is a surgical procedure in which a healthy cornea from a donor is transplanted into the patient's eye.

Answer:
B. Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests
B
api request failed
Reasoning: The patient has a nonhealing corneal ulcer that has not responded to treatment with topical moxifloxacin. The most likely cause of this ulcer is herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a common viral infection that can cause keratitis, or inflammation of the cornea. In some cases, HSV keratitis can lead to a corneal ulcer. The symptoms of HSV keratitis include redness, pain, and photophobia. The diagnosis of HSV keratitis is usually made based on the patient's history and clinical examination. However, laboratory tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis. These tests include viral culture and antigen detection tests. Treatment for HSV keratitis usually involves the use of antiviral medications, such as acyclovir. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the ulcer and promote healing.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a nonhealing corneal ulcer. He has a history of alcoholism and left-eye enucleation. The ulcer has not responded to topical moxifloxacin.

The conjunctiva demonstrates hyperemia, which is more prominent around the corneal lesion, although there is no discharge. A dilated ophthalmoscopic examination is unremarkable. Repeated bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. HSV keratitis is a common cause of corneal ulcers in adults. It is most often seen in patients with a history of HSV infection, such as recurrent cold sores. The typical presentation of HSV keratitis is a painful, red eye with a corneal ulcer. The ulcer may be superficial or deep, and it may be associated with stromal inflammation and edema.

The diagnosis of HSV keratitis is usually made based on the clinical presentation. However, confirmatory testing can be done with viral cultures, direct immunofluorescence, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

The treatment of HSV keratitis is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. These medications are usually given topically, but they may also be given systemically in severe cases. In addition, patients with HSV keratitis should be treated with topical antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection.

In this case, the patient has a nonhealing corneal ulcer that has not responded to topical moxifloxacin. This suggests that the ulcer may be caused by a viral infection, such as HSV. Therefore, the next step in management is to obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests. If the tests are positive, the patient should be started on a course of antiviral therapy.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a white man in his 20s with a history of medulloblastoma treated with irradiation of the brain and spine at age 2 years. He also received radiation therapy for a meningioma of the posterior fossa in adulthood. He was also treated for several seemingly similar lesions on the face and scalp and had a family history of similar cutaneous lesions reported in 2 brothers and 1 niece. The physical examination reveals numerous pink and brown papules and plaques, some with ulceration, on the head and along the midline of the neck and spine. The lesions are adjacent to the surgical excision scar within a prior irradiation field on the head and neck and overlying diffuse postsurgical scarring within a prior irradiation field on the back.

The most likely diagnosis is radiation-induced skin cancer, specifically postirradiation cutaneous SCC. This is a well-recognized complication of radiation therapy, with an estimated incidence of 1-5% after head and neck irradiation. The lesions typically develop 5-10 years after radiation therapy, but can occur as early as 2 years or as late as 30 years. The most common presentation is multiple erythematous papules and plaques, some with ulceration, in the irradiated field. The lesions can be mistaken for benign conditions such as actinic keratoses, but biopsy is always necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of radiation-induced cutaneous SCC is surgical excision with clear margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is often used for this purpose. Radiation therapy can also be used, but it is not as effective as surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used in patients with high-risk lesions.

Title: Rapidly Evolving Extensive Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positive Soft-Tissue Activity During Nivolumab Therapy Case is: A 41-year-old woman with a history of Hodgkin disease in her adolescence was diagnosed with melanoma of the left upper thigh that was classified as American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIA with (pT3aN0 [sn0/1] M0) BRAF mutation. One year later she underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy for macrometastasis followed by adjuvant immunotherapy with ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4. Owing to local disease progression, treatment escalation with combined immunotherapy (ipilimumab and nivolumab, an anti–PD-1 [programmed cell death 1]) antibody was initiated. Apart from immunotherapy-induced thyroiditis, the treatment was well tolerated. However, after 11 cycles of nivolumab, the patient presented with progressive painful reddening and swelling of the left thigh. There was no deterioration of the general condition, no fever, no change in current medication, and no recent cold exposure. Clinical examination revealed diffuse erythematous induration of the upper thigh expanding to the lower left abdominal area, as well as multiple small palpable subcutaneous nonindurated nodules on the ipsilateral gluteal region and leg (Figure, A). Fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) detected multiple FDG-active lesions in both lower extremities and the lumbar region; a previously described left iliac lymphadenopathy was partially regressed (Figure, B). A diagnostic biopsy specimen of the left thigh revealed a lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with dense infiltrate of mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells with no signs of vasculitis (Figure, C and D). Direct immunofluorescence and blood analysis showed an absence of specific autoimmune antigens (test results for α-1 antitrypsin, antinuclear antibody, anti-Sjögren syndrome–related antigen, and anti-Sjögren syndrome–related antigen B were all unremarkable).A, Localized erythematous brownish induration seen on the upper thigh.

Direct immunofluorescence and blood analysis showed an absence of specific autoimmune antigens.

The most likely diagnosis is nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis. This is a rare but well-described adverse effect of nivolumab, which is a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). The mechanism of nivolumab-induced panniculitis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction. The clinical presentation of nivolumab-induced panniculitis is variable, but it typically presents with erythema, induration, and tenderness of the skin. The lesions may be localized or widespread, and they may be associated with fever, malaise, and weight loss. The diagnosis of nivolumab-induced panniculitis is made on clinical grounds, and it is supported by biopsy findings of a lobular lymphocytic panniculitis. The treatment of nivolumab-induced panniculitis is generally supportive, and it may include corticosteroids, colchicine, or dapsone. In some cases, nivolumab may need to be discontinued.

Title: Acute Shortness of Breath in a Woman in Her 50s Case is: A woman in her mid-50s presented to the hospital with acute, worsening dyspnea, with shortness of breath at rest and with minimum exertion. She had undergone mechanical mitral valve replacement and aortic dissection repair 2 months prior to presentation. On physical examination, she was found to have elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral rales in her lungs, and reduced intensity of the mitral valve closure sound, and her international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic (1.5). An echocardiographic image showed a mean gradient of 12 mm Hg across the mitral valve, suggesting valve stenosis. Fluoroscopy showed restricted mobility of the leaflets (Video 1). Transesophageal echocardiography showed a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve, along with a small new dissection flap in the aortic root (Figure and Video 2). A chronic dissection flap was evident in the aortic arch and descending aorta, which was unchanged from the previous aortic dissection repair.Refer the patient for aortic root dissection repairAdminister a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activatorWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has acute shortness of breath, a new dissection flap in the aortic root, and a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve. These findings are concerning for acute aortic dissection and mechanical mitral valve thrombosis. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent treatment. Mechanical mitral valve thrombosis is a serious complication of mechanical mitral valve replacement that can lead to valve dysfunction, embolism, and death.

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to refer her for aortic root dissection repair. This procedure involves replacing the aortic valve and repairing the dissection flap. It is the only definitive treatment for aortic dissection and is associated with a high success rate.

Start intravenous heparin: Heparin is a blood thinner that can be used to treat mechanical mitral valve thrombosis. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a surgical emergency, and heparin should not be used to delay surgery.

Administer a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activator: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a thrombolytic agent that can be used to dissolve blood clots. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for aortic dissection. tPA can increase the risk of bleeding, and it is not effective in treating aortic dissection.

Perform emergency percutaneous clot removal: Percutaneous clot removal is a procedure that can be used to remove blood clots from the aortic valve. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for aortic dissection. Percutaneous clot removal is not effective in treating aortic dissection, and it can increase the risk of bleeding.

Title: An Aggressive Diffuse Supraorbital Mass Case is: A white man in his 70s presented with a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that had been neglected for 4 years. His comorbidities included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and a 50-pack-year history of tobacco abuse. Physical examination revealed a firm, nonmobile, nontender, bulging mass situated over the right frontal sinus, which expanded to the upper right eyelid. The mass covered the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction (Figure, A). However, the patient’s vision remained intact when the mass was elevated off the eye with great effort. His right pupil was round and reactive to light without afferent pupillary defect. No palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. A non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus (Figure, B). It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass (Figure, C). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure, D).A, Enlarged right supraorbital mass.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of smoking and a gradually enlarging right supraorbital mass that has been neglected for 4 years. The mass is firm, nonmobile, nontender, and bulging. It covers the globe completely, resulting in total vision obstruction. However, the patient’s vision remains intact when the mass is elevated off the eye with great effort.

Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm.

The most likely diagnosis is sebaceous carcinoma. Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that most commonly occurs in the head and neck region. It is thought to arise from sebaceous glands, which are oil-producing glands located in the skin. Sebaceous carcinoma can present with a variety of clinical features, including a slowly growing, painless mass, ulceration, and bleeding. On histopathology, sebaceous carcinoma is characterized by nests and cords of neoplastic sebaceous cells. These cells have abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm and round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Sebaceous carcinoma is a locally aggressive tumor that can metastasize to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. The treatment of sebaceous carcinoma is surgical excision with clear margins. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be considered in high-risk cases.

Title: Central Vertigo and Hearing Loss in an African Swimmer Case is: A 46-year-old African swimmer presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. He also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent his childhood in eastern Africa, where he swam in Lake Tanganyika. His history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints. The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. He could not walk properly owing to his vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve (Figure).

Title: A Man With Headache, Fever, and Neck Stiffness Case is: A 53-year-old man presented with 2 weeks of back pain, stiff neck, headache, and fevers. He also reported 3 days of right knee pain and swelling. He had a history of pseudogout and kidney transplant 13 years ago. He was taking sirolimus and prednisone, with excellent graft function. His temperature on presentation was 102°F (38.9°C). He had nuchal rigidity and positive Kernig sign. There were no focal neurologic deficits and no spinal tenderness. He had a right knee effusion without erythema and with full range of motion. Laboratory workup of serum showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10 200/μL (neutrophils, 63.8%; lymphocytes, 19.6%; monocytes, 15.1%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 63 mm/h; workup of cerebrospinal fluid showed a WBC count of 0/μL; red blood cell count, 32/μL; total protein level, 109 mg/dL; and glucose level, 59 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow (Figure 1). He was prescribed intravenous vancomycin and cefepime. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were negative.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of pseudogout and kidney transplant, which puts him at risk for infection. His presentation with back pain, stiff neck, headache, and fevers is concerning for meningitis. The MRI of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow, which is a non-specific finding that could be seen in a number of conditions, including infection. Blood and CSF cultures were negative, which does not rule out infection. Intravenous antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for meningitis, and should be continued until the patient is clinically improved and cultures are negative. Additional imaging with CT is not necessary at this time. Gabapentin is a medication used to treat neuropathic pain, and would not be the first-line treatment for meningitis. High-dose ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory medication, and would not be effective against an infection.

Title: Evaluating the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Case is: A healthy 65-year-old woman presented with 2 days of sustained throbbing, bilateral temporal headache and bilateral blurred vision. Laboratory results are shown in the Table. Given her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 110 mm/h and symptoms concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA), a temporal artery biopsy was obtained. Results showed a normal caliber lumen without infiltrating inflammatory cells.What Would You Do Next? A: Brain magnetic resonance imaging , B: Empirical methotrexate prescription , C: Empirical sumatriptan prescription , D: Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP). Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **(D) Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)**

**Reasoning:**

A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). In this case, the temporal artery biopsy showed a normal caliber lumen without infiltrating inflammatory cells, which makes the diagnosis of GCA unlikely.

The next step is to evaluate for other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be helpful to rule out other causes of headache, such as a stroke or tumor. However, the patient's symptoms are not concerning for a stroke or tumor, and the MRI is not likely to be diagnostic in this case.

Empirical methotrexate prescription is a treatment option for GCA, but it is not appropriate in this case because the patient's diagnosis is uncertain. Empirical sumatriptan prescription is a treatment option for migraine headaches, but it is not appropriate in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with migraine.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a test that can be used to evaluate for a variety of protein abnormalities, including those associated with inflammatory conditions. In this case, SPEP could be helpful to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a paraproteinemia.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 60s who presents with an approximately 4-month medical history of lip enlargement with nodular growths. Skin examination is significant for multiple erythematous and flesh-colored papules and nodules symmetrically affecting the upper and lower lips with extension onto the vermilion border. There are no intraoral lesions, and all other findings of his examination are within normal limits. The patient denies fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, cough, lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or other systemic symptoms. A biopsy was obtained of the vermilion lip.

The differential diagnosis for multiple lip papules and nodules includes granulomatous cheilitis, leukemia labialis, lip licker's dermatitis, and pyostomatitis vegetans.

Granulomatous cheilitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lips characterized by the presence of granulomas. Granulomas are small, round, raised lesions that are formed when the body's immune system responds to a foreign substance. The most common cause of granulomatous cheilitis is contact dermatitis, which is a reaction to an irritant or allergen. Other causes of granulomatous cheilitis include Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, and lupus.

Leukemia labialis is a rare condition that occurs in patients with leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of multiple, painful, red or purple papules and nodules on the lips. The lesions are caused by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin.

Lip licker's dermatitis is a condition that occurs in people who lick their lips excessively. The constant licking can irritate the skin and cause the formation of papules and nodules. The lesions are usually red and scaly.

Pyostomatitis vegetans is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition of the mouth that is characterized by the formation of multiple, painful, ulcerative lesions. The lesions are caused by the infiltration of neutrophils into the skin.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. The patient is a man in his 60s, which is the age group that is most commonly affected by granulomatous cheilitis. The patient's lips are enlarged and have multiple erythematous and flesh-colored papules and nodules. The lesions are symmetrically distributed on the upper and lower lips, and they extend onto the vermilion border. The patient does not have any intraoral lesions, and he does not have any systemic symptoms. The biopsy of the vermilion lip shows the presence of granulomas.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is granulomatous cheilitis.

Title: Yellow Periorbital Plaque and Retroperitoneal Fibrosis Case is: A woman in her 50s with a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque presented with unremitting abdominal and back pain. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space. Sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures were noted. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was diagnosed following biopsies. Prednisone and azathioprine were started. Biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque returned xanthelasma (Figure, A). Ureteral obstruction, chronic kidney disease, and lymphedema complicated her course. Azathioprine was stopped after 1 year. Prednisone was slowly tapered but she relapsed 3 years later. A second retroperitoneal biopsy exhibited fibroadipose tissue, foamy macrophages, and chronic inflammation with fibrosis. Azathioprine and prednisone were restarted. She required multiple surgeries for spinal stenosis and ureteral obstruction. Her kidney function continued declining. Then, owing to knee pain, a plain radiograph was obtained which demonstrated osteosclerosis of the distal femur. Consequently, the previous eyelid and retroperitoneal biopsies were reviewed. The clinicopathologic presentation was confirmed with a molecular test.A, Clinical image of a soft, nonscaly yellow-tan plaque on the medial canthus.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 50s with a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque who presented with unremitting abdominal and back pain. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space. Sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures were noted. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was diagnosed following biopsies. Prednisone and azathioprine were started.

Then, owing to knee pain, a plain radiograph was obtained which demonstrated osteosclerosis of the distal femur. Consequently, the previous eyelid and retroperitoneal biopsies were reviewed. The clinicopathologic presentation was confirmed with a molecular test.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of conditions that can cause retroperitoneal fibrosis, including idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare, idiopathic disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by the development of dense fibrosis in the retroperitoneal space. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, multisystem disorder that is characterized by the infiltration of foamy macrophages and other inflammatory cells in the retroperitoneum, as well as other organs, including the bones, lungs, and heart. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-cancerous disorder that is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell.

The clinical presentation of this patient is most consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient is a woman in her 50s, which is the age group that is most commonly affected by Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient presented with unremitting abdominal and back pain, which are common symptoms of Erdheim-Chester disease. The CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space, which is a characteristic finding in Erdheim-Chester disease. The sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures that were noted on the CT scan are also consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. The biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque returned xanthelasma, which is a benign condition that is not associated with Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's course was complicated by ureteral obstruction, chronic kidney disease, and lymphedema, which are all common complications of Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's kidney function continued declining, which is a poor prognostic sign in Erdheim-Chester disease. The plain radiograph that was obtained owing to knee pain demonstrated osteosclerosis of the distal femur, which is a characteristic finding in Erdheim-Chester disease. The previous eyelid and retroperitoneal biopsies were reviewed and the clinicopathologic presentation was confirmed with a molecular test, which further supports the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease.

In conclusion, the patient in this case most likely has Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Erdheim-Chester disease. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, idiopathic, multisystem disorder characterized by the accumulation of foamy macrophages and fibrosis in multiple organs, including the retroperitoneum, lungs, heart, and bones. The disease typically affects middle-aged and older adults, with a slight male predominance. The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, back pain, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include cough, dyspnea, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease is made based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results. Treatment is typically with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The prognosis for patients with Erdheim-Chester disease is variable, but the disease is often progressive and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

**Answer:** The answer is C, Erdheim-Chester disease.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning:

The patient in this case presented with a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque, unremitting abdominal and back pain, and extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space on CT scan. Sclerotic changes in multiple osseous structures were also noted. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was diagnosed following biopsies. Prednisone and azathioprine were started, but the patient relapsed 3 years later. A second retroperitoneal biopsy exhibited fibroadipose tissue, foamy macrophages, and chronic inflammation with fibrosis. Azathioprine and prednisone were restarted, but the patient's kidney function continued to decline. She eventually required multiple surgeries for spinal stenosis and ureteral obstruction.

The clinical presentation of this patient is most consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD). ECD is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by the deposition of foamy histiocytes and fibrosis in multiple organs, including the retroperitoneum, lungs, bones, and skin. The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, back pain, and weight loss. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis typically shows diffuse retroperitoneal fibrosis, which can lead to ureteral obstruction and kidney failure. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal tissue shows foamy histiocytes and chronic inflammation with fibrosis. There is no specific treatment for ECD, but corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents can be used to control the inflammation and fibrosis.

The other answer choices are not as likely in this case. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is a rare, inflammatory disorder characterized by the deposition of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol clefts in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and internal organs. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, rash, and weight loss. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of dendritic cell. The most common presenting symptoms are skin lesions, bone lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Xanthoelasma palpebrum is a benign, noninflammatory condition characterized by the deposition of cholesterol in the eyelids.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a middle-aged man with a 6-month history of worsening pruritic hand dermatitis that progressed to involve his face, trunk, upper extremities, and feet. He had emigrated from Japan more than 10 years earlier but had no history of recent travel. He took no medications, had no significant medical or surgical history, and denied personal and family history of atopy. While he worked as a biomedical researcher, he denied any caustic exposures. On physical examination, his face, trunk, upper extremities, palms, and soles were marked by 1- to 2-mm erythematous papules and pustules coalescing into large, partially indurated and polycyclic plaques with centrifugal extension and occasional central clearing. Treatment with potent topical corticosteroids was ineffective. Punch biopsies of lesions on the shoulder and foot were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF). EPF is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by the eruption of sterile pustules on follicular-based papules. It is most common in middle-aged men, and there is a slight male predominance. The exact cause of EPF is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder.

The characteristic clinical presentation of EPF is a widespread eruption of erythematous papules and pustules on the trunk, upper extremities, and face. The lesions are often coalescing and may have a central clearing. The eruption is typically pruritic and may be associated with fever, malaise, and arthralgias.

The diagnosis of EPF is made on clinical grounds, supported by histopathologic findings. The histopathologic features of EPF are non-specific, but typically show a perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils.

There is no cure for EPF, but the condition is often responsive to treatment with topical or systemic corticosteroids. In refractory cases, other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, may be used.

Near-infrared reflectance imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the right eye reveal hyporeflective teardrop-shaped lesions (black arrowheads). Simultaneous spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan passing through the acute macular neuroretinopathy lesions in the right eye reveals increased reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer (yellow arrowheads) and attenuation of the ellipsoid zone (white arrowheads).

The most likely diagnosis is acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMNR). AMNR is a rare, non-inflammatory, vaso-occlusive disorder of the macula. It is characterized by the sudden onset of visual disturbances, including photopsia, scotoma, and metamorphopsia. The fundus examination is typically normal, but there may be mild edema of the macula. OCT may show disruption of the outer retinal layers, including the outer plexiform layer and ellipsoid zone.

The treatment of AMNR is not well-established. Some studies have suggested that oral corticosteroids may be beneficial, while others have found no benefit. There is no evidence that other treatments, such as fluorescein angiography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, are helpful.

In this case, the most appropriate next step is to observe the patient and monitor her vision. If her vision does not improve, or if it worsens, then she may need to be treated with oral corticosteroids.

Reasoning:
The patient has a 2-week history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae. He presents with painless, blurry vision in the left eye. His ocular symptoms began 2 days prior when he noticed dark scotomas in his central field and decreased visual acuity. There was no recent trauma or strenuous physical activity. He has no relevant medical, ocular, or family history, and he denied use of illicit drugs or anticoagulants.

On examination, the patient has uncorrected visual acuity of 20/30 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Extraocular motility and intraocular pressures are normal. Results of an anterior examination are unremarkable. Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye reveals a pink optic nerve with sharp margins, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots extending from the posterior pole to the far periphery, and preretinal hemorrhage overlying the central macula. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography through the preretinal macular hemorrhage demonstrates layered blood in the sub–internal limiting membrane space. The right fundus exhibits a similar appearance aside from the preretinal hemorrhage.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes central retinal vein occlusion, Valsalva retinopathy, bacterial endocarditis, and leukemic retinopathy or blood dyscrasia.

Central retinal vein occlusion is a common cause of retinal ischemia and visual loss. It is characterized by occlusion of the central retinal vein, which results in venous congestion and ischemia of the retina. The patient's history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae raises the possibility of bacterial endocarditis. Bacterial endocarditis can cause retinal hemorrhages due to septic emboli. Leukemic retinopathy is a rare complication of leukemia that can cause retinal hemorrhages. Blood dyscrasias, such as thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies, can also cause retinal hemorrhages.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a fluorescein angiogram to evaluate the degree of ischemia and confirm the diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion. A fluorescein angiogram is a special type of X-ray that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It can help to determine the extent of the occlusion and the areas of the retina that are most ischemic.

Once the diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion has been confirmed, the patient should be started on treatment with oral anticoagulation. Anticoagulation helps to prevent further thrombus formation and can improve visual outcome. The patient should also be treated with systemic steroids to reduce inflammation and edema in the retina.

In addition to treatment with anticoagulation and steroids, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bacterial endocarditis. If bacterial endocarditis is suspected, the patient should be treated with intravenous antibiotics.

The patient should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of leukemic retinopathy or blood dyscrasia. If either of these conditions is suspected, the patient should be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Answer: A. Obtain a fluorescein angiogram to evaluate degree of ischemia and confirm a diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion

Title: Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia Hiding in Primary Acquired Melanosis Case is: A 65-year-old white man was referred to the clinic with a pigmented conjunctival lesion in the left eye. The referring physician suspected primary acquired melanosis (PAM). His ocular history was notable for occupational exposure to sunlight and occasional smoking. There was no personal or family history of cancer, and he denied ocular surgery or trauma. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD/OS, and intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 18 mm Hg OS. A slitlamp examination of the right eye showed no conjunctival pigmentation. Examination of the left eye revealed a pigmented lesion at the temporal limbus from 3 to 4 o’clock with a 2-mm extension into the cornea (Figure 1A). Some opalescence underlied the pigment on the cornea. In addition, there was an adjacent small area of flat, superficial, mobile bulbar conjunctival pigmentation. The anterior segment high-resolution optical coherence tomography (HR-OCT) of the 4-o’clock corneolimbal lesion of the left eye demonstrated thickened hyperreflective corneal epithelium with an abrupt transition from normal to abnormal (Figure 1B).A, Slitlamp photography of the left eye shows a pigmented limbal lesion at 3 to 4 o’clock; another small area of bulbar conjunctival pigmentation is noted (arrowhead). B, High-resolution optical coherence tomography of the left eye through the area of the pigmented conjunctival lesion (inset with red line in area of scan), showing epithelial hyperreflectivity and thickening with an abrupt change from normal to mildly thickened epithelium (arrowhead).What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a pigmented conjunctival lesion with some opalescence underlying the pigment on the cornea. This suggests that the lesion may be a type of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). OSSN is a precancerous condition that can develop into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC is a type of cancer that can spread to other parts of the body. Therefore, it is important to biopsy the lesion to determine whether it is malignant.

Title: Asymptomatic Follicular Conjunctivitis in an Elderly Man Case is: A 70-year old man with a history of soft contact lens wear presented for a general eye examination. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressure. Several giant follicles were noted on the right inferior palpebral conjunctiva, and a few smaller follicles were noted in the left inferior fornix. Papillae were also noted bilaterally on the superior palpebral conjunctiva. He did not report any redness or discharge but did note mildly increased irritation mainly from soft contact lens wear. He had endorsed proper contact lens care and hygiene. He also noted an upper respiratory tract illness 4 weeks before presentation. Initially, he received a giant papillary conjunctivitis diagnosis because of soft contact lens intolerance and a recommendation to take a contact lens break. Because of the papillary reaction, prednisolone acetate, 1%, twice a day for 2 weeks was prescribed.After 3 months, the symptoms had improved in the left eye, but conjunctival follicles were still present in the right inferior palpebral conjunctiva (Figure 1). The patient subsequently underwent testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and the result was negative. At the 1-year follow-up, the examination findings were unchanged. During this follow-up, Lyme disease and Epstein-Barr virus serologic tests were performed in addition to repeated chlamydia testing. The results were negative, except for a positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG.Slitlamp photograph showing prominent large follicles (arrowhead) in the right inferior palpebral conjunctiva.Start a longer trial of topical steroid with topical antihistamineOrder chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level testWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of soft contact lens wear who presented for a general eye examination. He did not report any redness or discharge but did note mildly increased irritation mainly from soft contact lens wear. He had endorsed proper contact lens care and hygiene. He also noted an upper respiratory tract illness 4 weeks before presentation. Initially, he received a giant papillary conjunctivitis diagnosis because of soft contact lens intolerance and a recommendation to take a contact lens break.

After 3 months, the symptoms had improved in the left eye, but conjunctival follicles were still present in the right inferior palpebral conjunctiva. The patient subsequently underwent testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and the result was negative. At the 1-year follow-up, the examination findings were unchanged. During this follow-up, Lyme disease and Epstein-Barr virus serologic tests were performed in addition to repeated chlamydia testing. The results were negative, except for a positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is chronic follicular conjunctivitis secondary to Epstein-Barr virus infection. This is supported by the patient's history of an upper respiratory tract illness 4 weeks before presentation, the presence of giant follicles on the right inferior palpebral conjunctiva, and the positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG serology.

The treatment of chronic follicular conjunctivitis secondary to Epstein-Barr virus infection is typically supportive. This may include artificial tears, cold compresses, and topical steroids. In some cases, oral steroids may be necessary.

In this case, the patient has been receiving topical steroids for 3 months without significant improvement. Therefore, it is reasonable to start a longer trial of topical steroid with topical antihistamine. This will help to reduce the inflammation and irritation associated with the condition.

It is also important to monitor the patient for signs of progression to a more serious condition, such as lymphoma. If the patient's symptoms worsen or if he develops any new symptoms, such as blurred vision, pain, or discharge, he should be seen by a doctor immediately.

Title: Monocular Crystalline Maculopathy in a Man in His 30s Case is: A white man in his 30s employed as a metal worker presented with a 2-month history of slightly blurry vision in his right eye. He denied photopsia or floaters and did not note any visual field defects. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. He had no history of ocular trauma, drug use, or familial ocular diseases.The anterior segment of both eyes was normal on slitlamp examination, but the fundus examination of the right eye showed multiple refractile small crystals scattered on the posterior pole (Figure 1A). Isolated crystals were also present in the vitreous core. Optical coherence tomography of the macula revealed the crystals to be located preretinally on the surface of the inner limiting membrane with sporadic crystals within the cortical vitreous (Figure 1B).A, Fundus photography at presentation shows multiple refractile crystals at the posterior pole (black arrowheads). B, The corresponding optic coherence tomography at presentation shows these crystals adhering to the internal limiting membrane and floating in the vitreous (white arrowheads).Apart from this, biomicroscopy, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography of the posterior pole showed no abnormalities. The left eye was unremarkable, and an radiographic image of the right eye socket revealed no foreign bodies.Screen for intravenous abuse of opioids and other substancesWhat Would You Do Next?

Isolated crystals were also present in the vitreous core. Optical coherence tomography of the macula revealed the crystals to be located preretinally on the surface of the inner limiting membrane with sporadic crystals within the cortical vitreous (Figure 1B).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), asteroid hyalosis, and crystalline maculopathy. PVD is the most common cause of posterior vitreous detachment, and it is typically seen in older adults. Asteroid hyalosis is a benign condition that is characterized by the presence of small, refractile crystals in the vitreous. Crystalline maculopathy is a rare condition that is characterized by the presence of crystals in the macula.

The patient's history and examination are most consistent with crystalline maculopathy. The crystals are located preretinally on the surface of the inner limiting membrane, which is characteristic of crystalline maculopathy. The crystals are also present in the vitreous core, which is not typically seen in PVD or asteroid hyalosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to screen for intravenous abuse of opioids and other substances. Intravenous abuse of opioids and other substances can lead to the development of crystalline maculopathy. The patient's history of working as a metal worker puts him at risk for intravenous abuse of opioids and other substances.

Title: Optic Nerve Head Edema in a Healthy Man in His 20s Case is: A previously healthy African American man in his 20s presented to the emergency department after referral by an optometrist for “bleeding in the back of the eye.” The patient noted that 2 months prior he began experiencing throbbing headaches in the back of his head that were more painful and associated with lightheadedness when laying down. Two weeks prior to presentation, he started noticing black spots in his peripheral vision and progressive blurring of vision in both eyes. The patient denied recent travel, cough, gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract symptoms, ulcers, aching joints, tinnitus, or transient visual obscurations. He reported owning cats.On presentation, the patient’s blood pressure was 210/150 mm Hg, and he had a history of acute kidney failure and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. On ophthalmic examination, his uncorrected near visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/30 OS. Extraocular motility, Ishihara color plates, intraocular pressure, pupils, and results of slitlamp examination were within normal limits. Ophthalmoscopy showed Frisen grade 5 optic nerve head swelling in both eyes with extensive flame hemorrhages and nerve fiber layer infarcts surrounding both nerves and retinal exudates extending from the nerves temporally into both fovea’s (Figure 1). The vessels were of normal course and caliber. There were scattered peripheral dot-and-blot hemorrhages. Results of Humphrey visual field testing were reliable and showed bilateral concentric constriction and enlarged blind spots.Grade 5 optic nerve head edema. A, Fundus photograph of the right eye shows Frisen grade 5 optic disc edema, flame hemorrhages, and peripapillary exudation into the macula.

Reasoning:
The patient presents with optic nerve head edema, flame hemorrhages, and nerve fiber layer infarcts surrounding both nerves and retinal exudates extending from the nerves temporally into both fovea’s. The vessels were of normal course and caliber. There were scattered peripheral dot-and-blot hemorrhages. Results of Humphrey visual field testing were reliable and showed bilateral concentric constriction and enlarged blind spots.

This presentation is consistent with hypertensive retinopathy, a condition caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to high blood pressure. The patient's blood pressure was 210/150 mm Hg on presentation, which is significantly elevated. He also has a history of acute kidney failure and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction, both of which are risk factors for hypertension.

The first step in management is to control the patient's blood pressure. This can be done with medication, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The patient's blood pressure should be lowered to below 140/90 mm Hg.

Once the patient's blood pressure is controlled, the next step is to workup the underlying cause of the hypertension. This may include blood tests to check for kidney disease, thyroid problems, and adrenal gland disorders. The patient should also be screened for sleep apnea, which can contribute to hypertension.

If the patient's blood pressure cannot be controlled with medication, or if there is an underlying cause of the hypertension that cannot be treated, the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove a part of the kidney (nephrectomy).

In addition to controlling the patient's blood pressure and working up the underlying cause of the hypertension, the patient should also be treated for any vision loss that has occurred. This may include laser therapy or surgery to repair the damage to the retina.

Title: Erythematous Macular Eruption in an Older Woman Case is: A white woman in her 70s with advanced Alzheimer disease was referred to the hematology clinic for evaluation of a high hemoglobin level (169 g/L; normal range, 120-160 g/L) and red blood cell count (5.67 × 1012/L; normal range, 3.8-4.8 × 1012/L) as well as a generalized itch that was worse after a bath. On examination, she had a florid, erythematous macular eruption over the trunk and limbs (Figure, A) but no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. In addition to the high hemoglobin level, mild lymphocytosis (absolute lymphocyte count, 6.2 × 109/L, range 1.5-4.0 × 109/L) was noted with the lymphocyte morphology, suggesting reactive changes. Skin biopsy specimen (Figure, B) showed a normal epidermis with a pericapillary infiltrate of small lymphocytes restricted to the dermis and no leukocytoclastic vasculitis, fungal organisms, or dermal mucin. The absence of cellular atypia and epidermal involvement suggested a diagnosis of lupus, or gyrate or annular erythema, and the need for clinicopathological correlation.A, Photograph shows erythroderma.

Reasoning:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer disease who presents with a high hemoglobin level, red blood cell count, and a generalized itch. On examination, she has a florid, erythematous macular eruption over the trunk and limbs. In addition to the high hemoglobin level, she has mild lymphocytosis. A skin biopsy shows a normal epidermis with a pericapillary infiltrate of small lymphocytes restricted to the dermis. Treatment with topical emollient, steroid creams, and oral antihistamines is suboptimal. The hemoglobin level remains high, and the lymphocyte count has increased.

The differential diagnosis includes:

* T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia: This is a rare type of leukemia characterized by an increase in mature T lymphocytes. It is typically seen in older adults, and patients often present with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. On examination, patients may have hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made by bone marrow biopsy. Treatment is with chemotherapy.
* Advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/Sézary syndrome: This is a rare type of lymphoma characterized by an increase in Sézary cells, which are atypical T lymphocytes. It is typically seen in older adults, and patients often present with a generalized pruritic rash. On examination, patients may have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. The diagnosis is made by skin biopsy. Treatment is with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
* Polycythemia rubra vera: This is a rare blood disorder characterized by an increase in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is typically seen in older adults, and patients often present with fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. On examination, patients may have a ruddy complexion, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. The diagnosis is made by blood tests. Treatment is with phlebotomy (bloodletting) and hydroxyurea.
* Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: This is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. It is typically seen in women of childbearing age, and patients often present with a rash on the face, neck, and hands. On examination, patients may have photosensitivity, oral ulcers, and arthritis. The diagnosis is made by a skin biopsy and blood tests. Treatment is with topical steroids, oral steroids, and other medications.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is cutaneous lupus erythematosus. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The patient has a history of Alzheimer disease, which is a risk factor for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The patient's physical examination reveals a florid, erythematous macular eruption over the trunk and limbs. This is a typical finding in cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The patient's laboratory findings reveal a high hemoglobin level and mild lymphocytosis. These findings are not specific for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, but they are consistent with the diagnosis.

Title: A Patient With Multiple Coronary Artery Aneurysms Case is: A man in his early 40s was admitted to the hospital because of acute chest pain. Laboratory test results were notable for high serum concentrations of IgG4 (5650 mg/dL; to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01) and C-reactive protein (78.1 mg/L; to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Coronary computed tomographic angiography was performed (Figure, A and B). It revealed a large aneurysm (90 mm × 48 mm) with a thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a perivascular soft-tissue mass involving the patent proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery, which showed homogeneous moderate enhancement on contrast-enhanced images. Coronary computed tomographic angiography with cinematic rendering (Figure, C) showed multiple mass lesions around the RCA and LAD. Invasive coronary angiography results were unable to visualize the LAD but did identify a hypervascular mass in the proximal RCA.A, Contrast-enhanced axial computed tomographic image revealing perivascular soft-tissue masses involving the left circumflex and right coronary arteries (arrowheads).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has multiple coronary artery aneurysms, which are a rare and life-threatening condition. The most common cause of coronary artery aneurysms is atherosclerosis, but they can also be caused by infections, inflammatory diseases, and trauma. The patient's history of chest pain and laboratory test results suggest that he has an inflammatory condition, such as giant cell arteritis or Takayasu arteritis. These conditions can cause inflammation and narrowing of the arteries, which can lead to aneurysm formation.

The treatment for coronary artery aneurysms depends on the underlying cause. In patients with atherosclerosis, treatment typically involves lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. In patients with inflammatory diseases, treatment typically involves high-dose corticosteroid therapy. In patients with Takayasu arteritis, treatment typically involves high-dose immunosuppressant therapy.

In this case, the patient has a large aneurysm with a thrombus, which is a blood clot that can block the artery and lead to a heart attack. The patient also has perivascular soft-tissue masses, which are masses of tissue that surround the artery. These findings suggest that the patient has an inflammatory condition, such as giant cell arteritis or Takayasu arteritis.

The best treatment for this patient is high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce the inflammation and swelling in the arteries. This can help to prevent the aneurysm from growing larger and from rupturing. Corticosteroids can also help to reduce the risk of heart attack.

Title: Enlarging Right-Sided Tongue Mass in an Adult Male Case is: A 53-year-old African American man with a history of bipolar disorder presented to the emergency department with an enlarging right-sided tongue mass that had caused mild discomfort and halitosis over the course of 1 week. He denied recent injury, fever, chills, odynophagia, or difficulty breathing. Laboratory examination was significant for leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 700/μL) and hypercalcemia (total calcium level, 13.1 mg/dL) (to convert white blood cells to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001; to convert calcium to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25). Physical examination was notable for a 4- to 5-cm pedunculated, ulcerative mass on the dorsal oral aspect of the tongue near midline, anterior to the foramen cecum, without palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a rim-enhancing, centrally hypodense lesion in the right dorsal tongue abutting the lingual septum with a somewhat ill-defined border (Figure 1); there was no associated osseous erosion of the mandible or hard palate, no tongue prolapse to suggest hypoglossal nerve palsy, no involvement of the soft palate, and no cervical lymphadenopathy by radiological size criteria. An excisional biopsy of the anterior aspect of the mass was performed at bedside, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the otolaryngology clinic.A, Sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrates an exophytic mass on the dorsal aspect of the tongue.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 53-year-old African American man with a history of bipolar disorder who presented to the emergency department with an enlarging right-sided tongue mass that had caused mild discomfort and halitosis over the course of 1 week. He denied recent injury, fever, chills, odynophagia, or difficulty breathing.

An excisional biopsy of the anterior aspect of the mass was performed at bedside, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the otolaryngology clinic.

The differential diagnosis for an enlarging tongue mass includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign lesions are oral squamous papillomas, which are typically small, pedunculated, and exophytic. Other benign lesions include fibromas, hemangiomas, and lipomas. Malignant lesions include squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.

In this case, the patient's history of bipolar disorder is not relevant to the diagnosis. The laboratory findings of leukocytosis and hypercalcemia are non-specific and could be seen with a variety of conditions. The physical examination findings of a pedunculated, ulcerative mass on the dorsal oral aspect of the tongue are most consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The CT findings of a rim-enhancing, centrally hypodense lesion in the right dorsal tongue abutting the lingual septum with a somewhat ill-defined border are also consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.

She had previously been treated with antibiotics and mupirocin nasal irrigation, with temporary improvement. The patient and her identical twin sister had required multiple surgical procedures in the past for osseous lesions in the upper and lower jaws, including an aggressive resection via bilateral Caldwell-Luc approach 2 years previously.

On examination, there was bulging of the left lateral nasal wall. Imaging revealed a 14-mm, dense, expansile, sclerotic mass with moderate calcifications obstructing the left nasolacrimal duct; a similar 2.3 × 1.8–cm lesion of the right mandibular body; and evidence of previous sinus surgery.

Because of these findings, left-sided endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and sinus surgery was performed. Histologic findings showed a proliferation of highly cellular, fibrous connective tissue and cementum-like hard tissue.

The most likely diagnosis is fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign, non-neoplastic bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. It is usually monostotic (affecting one bone), but can be polyostotic (affecting multiple bones). The most common sites of involvement are the femur, tibia, ribs, skull, and mandible.

The etiology of fibrous dysplasia is unknown, but it is thought to be a developmental disorder. It is more common in females than males, and typically presents in childhood or adolescence. The clinical manifestations of fibrous dysplasia vary depending on the location and extent of the lesions. Patients may be asymptomatic, or may have pain, swelling, or deformity of the affected bone. Radiographs show a characteristic "ground-glass" appearance of the bone.

The treatment of fibrous dysplasia is usually conservative, with observation and pain management. Surgery may be indicated for cosmetic reasons, or to relieve pain or pressure.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 60s who presents with multiple submucosal masses of the right upper lip. She denies associated pain, bleeding, or recent trauma to the lip. She also denies any other constitutional symptoms. Her social history is significant for a 45-pack-year smoking history and social drinking.

On physical examination, the patient has right upper lip submucosal masses without any tenderness or mucosal abnormality. The remainder of the otolaryngic examination is unremarkable. A computed tomographic scan of the neck with contrast demonstrates multiple hyperenhancing nodules; the largest was 3 × 7 × 6 mm, with no local bony erosion or cervical lymphadenopathy.

The differential diagnosis for multiple submucosal masses of the upper lip includes basal cell adenoma, basal cell adenocarcinoma, multifocal canalicular adenoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Basal cell adenoma is a benign tumor of the basal cell layer of the epidermis. It is typically a solitary lesion that presents as a small, papular or nodular mass. Basal cell adenomas are rarely multiple.

Basal cell adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor of the basal cell layer of the epidermis. It is typically a locally invasive tumor that can spread to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. Basal cell adenocarcinomas are often multiple.

Multifocal canalicular adenoma is a rare, benign tumor of the salivary glands. It is typically a multiple lesion that presents as small, papular or nodular masses. Multifocal canalicular adenomas are usually located in the parotid gland.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the salivary glands. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that can spread to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. Adenoid cystic carcinomas are often multiple.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of basal cell adenoma. The CT scan findings are also consistent with a benign process. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is basal cell adenoma.

Title: A 22-Year-Old Man With Painful Vesicles on His Flank Case is: A 22-year-old man presented with an 8-year history of painful and slightly pruritic skin lesions on his right flank. The number of lesions and degree of pain had alternately increased and decreased over the years. Occasionally the lesions would rupture and leak clear fluid. One year prior, he was hospitalized for a “skin infection” on his right flank and treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient, a construction demolition worker, was otherwise healthy and took no medications. He had 1 lifetime female sexual partner with whom he used barrier contraception. Physical examination revealed an asymmetric cluster of lesions on the right flank measuring 14 × 12 cm at the widest margins (Figure 1). The cluster contained verrucous papules and plaques in the center and vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid in the periphery. Crust was partially covering some of the lesions. The surrounding skin was erythematous without warmth or induration. The remainder of the physical examination was normal except for stretch marks on the lateral abdomen.Left, Vesicular and verrucous skin lesions on patient’s right flank.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Shingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has chickenpox, the VZV virus remains dormant in the nerve roots. In some people, the virus can reactivate years later and cause shingles.

Shingles is characterized by a painful, blistering rash that occurs in a single dermatome, or area of skin supplied by a single nerve. The rash is often preceded by a burning or tingling sensation in the affected area. The lesions of shingles typically crust over and heal within 2-4 weeks.

The treatment of shingles typically includes antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. These medications can help to reduce the severity of the rash and shorten the duration of the illness. Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine cream, can be used to relieve the pain. In some cases, oral steroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation.

In the case of the patient presented in the question, the most appropriate next step is to biopsy the lesions. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of shingles and rule out other possible causes of the rash, such as bacterial infection or contact dermatitis. Once the diagnosis of shingles is confirmed, the patient can be started on antiviral treatment.

Title: Abdominal Pain and Vomiting in a Pregnant Woman Who Has Had a Gastric Bypass Procedure Case is: A 31-year-old gravida 2, para 1 patient of 36 weeks’ gestation had undergone a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) 4 years ago, resulting in prepregnancy weight loss of 70 kg, or 128% of her excess weight. She awakened with severe lower back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She came to the emergency department with 10/10 abdominal pain but no fever, chills, vaginal bleeding, or rupture of membranes. Her abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness and guarding. She was initially diagnosed as having preterm labor and was given antibiotics, steroids, an epidural catheter for pain management, and intravenous fentanyl as needed. She delivered a healthy baby without complications, but her severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting persisted. Thirty-six hours after her initial presentation, she still had rebound tenderness in the left side of the abdomen. She was afebrile, blood pressure was 104/77 mm Hg, and heart rate was 152/min. White blood cell count was 10.7 ×109/L; anion gap, 13 mEq/L; and lactate dehydrogenase level, 131.7 U/L (2.2 μkat/L). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast revealed mesenteric vascular compromise (Figure 1); after the scan, the patient had hematemesis.What Would You Do Next? A: Esophagogastrojejunoscopy , B: Exploratory laparotomy , C: Highly selective mesenteric angiography , D: Diagnostic laparoscopy. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is a 31-year-old woman with a history of gastric bypass who presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, and hematemesis. She has a history of preterm labor, but this has been ruled out. Her physical examination reveals diffuse tenderness and guarding. Her laboratory tests show an elevated white blood cell count, anion gap, and lactate dehydrogenase level. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast reveals mesenteric vascular compromise. These findings are consistent with mesenteric ischemia, which is a life-threatening condition.

Answer: The next step in management is to perform a highly selective mesenteric angiography. This procedure involves injecting contrast dye into the mesenteric arteries to visualize the blood vessels in the abdomen. If mesenteric ischemia is present, the angiography will show narrowing or occlusion of the arteries. This information can be used to guide treatment, which may include surgery to restore blood flow to the intestines.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Esophagogastrojejunoscopy is a procedure that is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It is not the best option for diagnosing or treating mesenteric ischemia. Exploratory laparotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the abdomen to look for the cause of abdominal pain. It is a more invasive procedure than angiography and should only be used if angiography is not possible or if the results of angiography are inconclusive. Diagnostic laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves making small incisions in the abdomen and inserting a camera to look inside. It is not the best option for diagnosing or treating mesenteric ischemia.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with mesenteric ischemia, which is a surgical emergency. Mesenteric ischemia is caused by a blockage of the blood supply to the small intestine, which can lead to tissue death and perforation. The patient's history of gastric bypass surgery makes her more susceptible to mesenteric ischemia, as the surgery can alter the anatomy of the small intestine and make it more prone to blockage.

The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a highly selective mesenteric angiography. This procedure involves injecting a dye into the arteries that supply the small intestine, which allows the physician to visualize the blood vessels and identify the site of the blockage. If the blockage is located in a major artery, the physician may be able to open the artery using a balloon catheter or stent. If the blockage is located in a smaller artery, the physician may need to perform an exploratory laparotomy to remove the blockage.

Title: A 54-Year-Old Man With Pancytopenia Case is: A 54-year-old man presented for evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia. He had a distant history of viral myocarditis and was taking lisinopril, carvedilol, furosemide, aspirin, and a multivitamin. No new medications had been started in the past year. Twelve years prior, he underwent uncomplicated Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Review of systems was notable for fatigue and negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, dyspnea, or abnormal bleeding. Examination revealed temperature of 36.7°C; heart rate, 91/min; blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg; and body mass index, 20.1 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). He was well-appearing with conjunctival pallor but no petechiae, no hepatosplenomegaly, and a normal neurologic examination.Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 1.7 × 103/μL with an absolute neutrophil count of 0.17 × 103/μL; hemoglobin level, 7 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 103 fL (reticulocyte index, 0.94); and platelet count, 116 × 103/μL. Results of a complete blood cell count from 8 months prior were normal. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, as were levels of lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed no lymphadenopathy, masses, or hepatosplenomegaly. Peripheral blood smear showed occasional pseudo Pelger-Huet cells and rare teardrop cells. Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate revealed a normocellular marrow and dyserythropoiesis with vacuolized and dysplastic erythroid precursors (Figure, panel A), left-shifted granulocytic maturation with vacuolized granulocytic precursors, ring sideroblasts (Figure, panel B), and no increase in blasts. Cytogenetic studies from the bone marrow did not reveal any abnormalities.Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate from patient (A, Wright-Giemsa, original magnification ×1000; B, Prussian blue iron, original magnification ×1000).Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zincObtain periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treat with supportive transfusions as clinically indicatedPerform endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tractWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to aplastic anemia, a condition in which the bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells. Aplastic anemia can be caused by a number of factors, including exposure to toxins, drugs, or radiation, or it can be idiopathic (of unknown cause).

The patient's history of viral myocarditis suggests that he may have an underlying autoimmune disorder, which could be the cause of his aplastic anemia. The patient's laboratory evaluation shows a normocellular marrow with dyserythropoiesis and left-shifted granulocytic maturation, which are characteristic findings in aplastic anemia. Cytogenetic studies from the bone marrow did not reveal any abnormalities, which makes it less likely that the patient's aplastic anemia is due to a chromosomal abnormality.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treat with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated. This will allow the patient's physicians to monitor his response to treatment and to provide him with blood transfusions as needed to prevent complications of anemia.

In addition to supportive care, the patient may also be treated with immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, in an attempt to suppress his immune system and allow his bone marrow to recover. If the patient does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy, he may be a candidate for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Title: Recurrent Bullous Eruption in a Young Woman Case is: A woman in her 20s presented with almost equally sized, round erythematous plaques with central pallor and confluent blisters at the periphery on both forearms. Older lesions showed central crusts. According to the patient, the lesions recurrently appeared during the last 9 years, with a symptom-free period of 2 years (Figure, A). She could not identify or recall a specific cause for these skin lesions and denied self-inflicting them. She had been treated with antibiotics (cefuroxime) as well as with topical steroids (dexamethasone) but denied any lasting effect. Her family history was without abnormalities. She reported being vaccinated against varicella zoster virus and was not immunocompromised.A, A clinical photograph shows an annular erythematous plaque with crusts, bullae, and central pallor. B, Histopathologic specimen shows normal stratum corneum, confluent necrosis of the upper epidermal layers, some multinucleated keratinocytes in the adjacent epidermis, and papillary edema with a subepidermal blister.

A: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis , B: Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta , C: Herpes virus infection , D: Bullous pemphigoid. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a young woman with a history of recurrent bullous eruptions on the forearms. The lesions are annular, erythematous, and have central pallor and confluent blisters at the periphery. The patient denies any specific cause for the lesions and has been treated with antibiotics and topical steroids without lasting effect. Her family history is without abnormalities and she is not immunocompromised.

The histopathologic specimen shows normal stratum corneum, confluent necrosis of the upper epidermal layers, some multinucleated keratinocytes in the adjacent epidermis, and papillary edema with a subepidermal blister. A moderately dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophilic and neutrophilic granulocytes is present in the upper dermis.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by subepidermal blisters. The blisters are typically tense and filled with clear fluid. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the trunk and extremities.

The exact cause of bullous pemphigoid is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. In autoimmune disorders, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In the case of bullous pemphigoid, the immune system attacks the proteins that hold the skin together. This leads to the formation of blisters.

There is no cure for bullous pemphigoid, but it can be treated with medications that suppress the immune system. These medications can help to control the symptoms of the disease and prevent new blisters from forming.

Title: Arthropathy and Cutaneous Eruption in a Patient With Cystic Fibrosis Case is: An elementary school-aged girl with cystic fibrosis (CF) presented with a 2-year history of a relapsing-remitting, evanescent, salmon-pink maculopapular cutaneous eruption associated with joint pain. Each episode of joint pain and cutaneous eruption lasted 24 to 48 hours with episodes occurring anywhere from every other day to once weekly. The patient’s mother was unable to identify any possible triggers because the episodes occurred independent of pulmonary CF exacerbations or antibiotic use. The patient’s joint pain and cutaneous symptoms resolved completely between each episode and were not associated with fever. Review of photos taken during the patient’s flares revealed a variable eruption consisting of oval-shaped, salmon-pink macules on the trunk, urticarial-appearing papules on the dorsal hands, and flagellate arrays of petechial macules on the upper medial arms (Figure 1). This eruption was intermittently pruritic but otherwise was asymptomatic. Her joint pain recurred with each episode of cutaneous eruption and primarily affected the wrist, knee, and ankle joints bilaterally. She had been treated with naproxen during these flares, which improved her joint pain but not her cutaneous symptoms. A complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel as well as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate obtained during a flare were normal. Titers for parvovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and antistreptolysin O were also negative.A, Approximately 1-cm, oval-shaped, salmon-pink macules on the right lower abdomen and right lateral thigh.

Titers for parvovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and antistreptolysin O were also negative.

The most likely diagnosis is cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis (CFAEA). CFAEA is a rare, but well-described, condition that occurs in patients with CF. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of arthritis, often accompanied by cutaneous eruption. The arthritis is typically non-erosive and oligoarticular, and it most commonly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. The cutaneous eruption is typically a salmon-pink maculopapular rash that is often pruritic. The diagnosis of CFAEA is made clinically, based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. There is no specific treatment for CFAEA, but treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms of arthritis and cutaneous eruption. Treatment options include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents.

Title: Type 2 Diabetes Presenting With Persistent Chorea Case is: A man in his late 60s with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years that was complicated by neuropathy and retinopathy presented with persistent chorea in the left upper extremity for about 1 month despite aggressive correction with insulin. He was alert and oriented with healthy vital signs. No evidence of cognitive impairments was present on bedside testing results. The patient denied any recent infections and risk for human immunodefiency virus (HIV) infection. Neurological examination results were significant for choreiform and hemiballistic movements involving the left upper extremity. His home medications were carefully reviewed to rule out any medications that could cause chorea. A review of his previous records indicated an admission to an outside facility 3 weeks beforehand with severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c level of 14.1% (to convert to the proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). Despite an aggressive correction of blood glucose levels and metabolic correction, his choreiform movements had remained unresolved. On admission, a complete electrolyte and toxicology panel, including calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, yielded normal results. The patient’s serum glucose level was 159 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) and his hemoglobin A1c was 10.9% without ketoacidosis. Test results for antinuclear antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. Serum thyrotropin levels, liver function test results, and parathyroid hormone levels were healthy. Copper studies, a peripheral smear, and a routine electroencephalogram yielded normal results. A general screening for cancers yielded negative results. The patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure), which showed a T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and a lentiform nucleus with no restricted diffusion. Oral administration of olanzapine, 2.5 mg daily, in divided doses with careful monitoring of blood glucose levels resulted in the complete resolution of chorea.Magnetic resonance imaging shows T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head (A) and a lentiform nucleus with no restricted diffusion (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: Chronic Eye Redness and Pain After 9 Months of Anti-inflammatory Therapy Case is: A 50-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and allergies presented to the ophthalmology clinic for an evaluation of uveitis after experiencing 9 months of eye redness and pain that started in her right eye and involved both eyes within a few months. The patient had a history of asthma and had recently been hospitalized after radiologic findings of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome and received high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. At hospital discharge, the patient’s medications were changed to prednisone, 11 mg orally once daily, and azathioprine, 100 mg orally once daily.Although the severity of the ocular symptoms was variable, there was no improvement with the described medication regimen or with currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient denied rash, headache, and joint pain. Serologic testing ruled out infectious causes of inflammation.On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Intraocular pressure for the right eye was 16 mm Hg and for the left eye was 24 mm Hg. Slitlamp examination showed trace hyperemia of the right eye and 2+ diffuse scleral hyperemia of the left eye (Figure). Corneas were clear bilaterally, and sensitivity was symmetric and full. There was no cell or flare in the anterior chamber, and she had clear lenses with normal irises.

**Reasoning:** The patient has been experiencing chronic eye redness and pain for 9 months, despite treatment with oral prednisone and azathioprine. The patient's symptoms are concerning for uveitis, which is an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. The patient's history of asthma and recent hospitalization for pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome suggests that she may have an underlying autoimmune disorder.

The patient's examination findings are consistent with uveitis. The scleral hyperemia and lack of cell or flare in the anterior chamber suggest that the inflammation is chronic. The fundus examination is unremarkable, which suggests that the inflammation is not causing any damage to the retina.

The patient's current treatment regimen is not effective in controlling her uveitis. Oral prednisone is a first-line treatment for uveitis, but it is not always effective. Azathioprine is a second-line treatment for uveitis, but it can take several months to be effective.

The next step in the patient's management is to increase the dosage of her oral corticosteroids. This will help to control the inflammation and relieve her symptoms. If the patient does not respond to this treatment, she may need to be started on a different immunosuppressive medication, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus.

Title: Central Scotoma a Year After Motor Vehicle Crash Case is: A woman in her early 60s presented with an 8-month history of central scotoma and blurry vision in her right eye. Her medical history was significant for a motor vehicle crash that occurred almost a year earlier, with no direct head trauma or eye injury. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/500 OD and 20/30 OS. Anterior segment examination was remarkable for pseudophakia on the right eye and mild cataract in the left. Fundus examination was remarkable for a slightly blunted foveal reflex in the right eye. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed segmental atrophy of the inner retina (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing (Figure 1B).A, Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the right eye. B, Fluorescein angiogram of the right eye.What Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history of a motor vehicle crash almost a year earlier, with no direct head trauma or eye injury, is concerning for a delayed traumatic optic neuropathy (TON). TON is a rare but serious condition that can occur after a head injury, even in the absence of direct eye injury. It is caused by damage to the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. The most common symptom of TON is sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye. Other symptoms may include pain behind the eye, headache, and nausea.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity of 20/500 in the right eye is consistent with a significant loss of vision. The anterior segment examination is unremarkable, which means that there are no obvious problems with the front of the eye. The fundus examination is remarkable for a slightly blunted foveal reflex in the right eye. The fovea is the area of the retina that provides the sharpest vision. A blunted foveal reflex is a sign of damage to the retina.

The SD-OCT showed segmental atrophy of the inner retina. The inner retina is the layer of the retina that contains the nerve cells that send visual information to the brain. Atrophy of the inner retina is a sign of damage to these nerve cells.

The fluorescein angiography was unrevealing. Fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. The unrevealing fluorescein angiography suggests that the patient's vision loss is not due to a blockage of the blood vessels in the eye.

Based on the patient's history, examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is delayed traumatic optic neuropathy. The next step in management is to perform an automated visual field test. An automated visual field test is a test that measures the patient's peripheral vision. The test is important for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of TON.

Title: Elevated Intraocular Pressure in a Young Man With a History of Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis Case is: A 24-year-old South Asian man presented with acute-onset pain and decreased vision in his left eye. His ocular history was significant for high myopia, a long-standing traumatic retinal detachment in his right eye, and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery of the left eye 8 months earlier. Three months earlier, the patient experienced an episode of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) of the left eye, which was treated with travoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.004%, and oral acetazolamide and resolved. The patient’s presenting visual acuity was counting fingers OD (baseline) and 20/200 OS. His initial IOPs were right eye 16 mm Hg and left eye 46 mm Hg by TonoPen. Examination of the left eye indicated normal gonioscopy results and unremarkable anterior and posterior segment examination findings except for the presence of corneal edema without keratic precipitates. The patient started treatment with dorzolamide hydrochloride, timolol maleate, brimonidine tartrate, latanoprost, and oral acetazolamide.The next day, the left eye IOP improved to 28 mm Hg as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), with a clear cornea and return of visual acuity to 20/20. Despite continuing maximum medical therapy for 1 week, the patient’s examination findings remained unchanged. Because of a concern for possible trabeculitis, he also started treatment with topical prednisolone acetate 4 times daily and oral valacyclovir hydrochloride. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic with decreased vision in his left eye, which showed an IOP measured by GAT of 6 mm Hg, visual acuity of 20/400, and a cornea that was edematous (Figure 1).A, Slitlamp photograph showing a prominent laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) flap in the patient’s left eye.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in his left eye, which was treated with travoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.004%, and oral acetazolamide and resolved. He presented with acute-onset pain and decreased vision in his left eye, with an IOP of 46 mm Hg by TonoPen. Examination of the left eye indicated normal gonioscopy results and unremarkable anterior and posterior segment examination findings except for the presence of corneal edema without keratic precipitates. The patient started treatment with dorzolamide hydrochloride, timolol maleate, brimonidine tartrate, latanoprost, and oral acetazolamide.

Despite continuing maximum medical therapy for 1 week, the patient’s examination findings remained unchanged. Because of a concern for possible trabeculitis, he also started treatment with topical prednisolone acetate 4 times daily and oral valacyclovir hydrochloride. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic with decreased vision in his left eye, which showed an IOP measured by GAT of 6 mm Hg, visual acuity of 20/400, and a cornea that was edematous.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of secondary glaucoma due to an inflammatory process, such as trabeculitis. The patient's IOP was initially controlled with medical therapy, but his examination findings remained unchanged despite continued treatment. The patient's IOP then decreased to 6 mm Hg, which is within the normal range. However, the patient's visual acuity was decreased to 20/400, and his cornea was edematous. These findings suggest that the patient's IOP is still elevated, despite the low reading on the tonometer.

The next step in management is to recheck the IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap. This will help to determine if the patient's IOP is truly low or if the tonometer is reading falsely low due to the LASIK flap. If the IOP is truly low, then the patient may be able to be discharged from the hospital and followed as an outpatient. If the IOP is still elevated, then the patient will need to be treated with additional medications or surgery.

Title: Atypical Fundus Mass in a Child Case is: A 2-year-old white boy was referred for evaluation of a choroidal mass. He had mild periorbital edema and low-grade eye pain in the left eye over 2 weeks prior to presentation. He had completed antibiotic treatment for presumed sinusitis with no improvement. A recent flulike illness over the past 1.5 weeks responded minimally to ibuprofen. Medical and family history were otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits revealed an intraocular mass, suspicious for retinoblastoma. The patient was advised consultation by an ocular oncology service.On examination, visual acuity was fix and follow OU. The right eye showed normal findings anteriorly and posteriorly. The left eye revealed mild conjunctival chemosis with periorbital edema. There was trace eyelid edema and mild leukocoria. Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination of the left eye displayed a solid gray mass in the macular region, deep to the retina and with surrounding subretinal fluid (Figure 1A).A, Dilated ophthalmoscopic examination found a gray mass in the macular region of the left eye measuring 12 mm in diameter and 5.1 mm in thickness, with additional subretinal fluid inferiorly. B, B-scan ultrasonography confirmed the fundus mass, dependent subretinal fluid, and echolucency outside the posterior wall of the eye.Examination under anesthesia confirmed the solid mass, measuring 12 mm in diameter and 5.1 mm in thickness and demonstrating echodensity on ultrasonography (Figure 1B). There were no tumor-feeding vessels, and tumor margins were ill defined. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated slight hyperfluorescence of the disc and faint hyperfluorescence of the mass with overlying scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescent leakage. Optical coherence tomography revealed shallow subretinal fluid extending within 3.2 mm of the foveola.What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 2-year-old white boy with a choroidal mass suspicious for retinoblastoma. The mass is solid, gray, and located in the macular region of the left eye. There is also subretinal fluid inferiorly. The tumor margins are ill defined, and there are no tumor-feeding vessels. Fluorescein angiography demonstrates slight hyperfluorescence of the disc and faint hyperfluorescence of the mass with overlying scattered pinpoint hyperfluorescent leakage. Optical coherence tomography reveals shallow subretinal fluid extending within 3.2 mm of the foveola.

The most likely diagnosis is retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a rare but aggressive cancer of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood, accounting for approximately 3% of all childhood cancers. Retinoblastoma is typically diagnosed in children under the age of 5 years.

The treatment of retinoblastoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, treatment may consist of cryotherapy, laser therapy, or focal chemotherapy. In more advanced disease, treatment may include enucleation (removal of the eye) or systemic chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient has a large, aggressive tumor that is located in the macular region of the eye. The tumor is also close to the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision. This makes the tumor a high risk for vision loss.

The best treatment option for this patient is intra-arterial chemotherapy. Intra-arterial chemotherapy is a technique that delivers chemotherapy drugs directly to the tumor through a small catheter inserted into the artery that supplies blood to the eye. This allows for high concentrations of chemotherapy drugs to be delivered directly to the tumor, while minimizing the side effects of the drugs on the rest of the body.

Title: Progressive Proptosis and Worsening Vision Case is: A woman in her mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules presented for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when she reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. She did not report any pain or diplopia.Visual acuity was 20/150 OD (no improvement with pinhole) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary reaction and confrontational visual fields were normal. External examination was notable for proptosis of 7 mm, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion. A firm, nontender mass was palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland was erythematous and prominent compared with the normal-appearing left lacrimal gland. Ocular motility showed −2 abduction deficit, right eye. Slitlamp examination revealed pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification (right > left), but was otherwise normal. Sensation was normal in the V1, V2 distribution, and there was no preauricular, submandibular, or anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. No lytic bone changes or bone remodeling could be seen (Figure 1).Computed tomographic imaging from outside facility revealed a 1.9 × 2.3 × 1.8-cm mass of an unclear cause within the anterolateral right orbit, exerting mass effect on the globe.What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her mid-60s with a history of breast cancer (status post lumpectomy 7 years earlier [N0, M0]) and benign thyroid nodules who presents for evaluation of right-sided proptosis. Bulging of the right eye was first noted 6 months earlier elsewhere when she reported progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye. She did not report any pain or diplopia.

The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for a mass in the right orbit. The proptosis, hypoglobus, and resistance to retropulsion are all consistent with a mass in the anterior orbit. The erythema and prominence of the palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland are also concerning for a mass in this location. The abduction deficit is consistent with compression of the third cranial nerve by the mass. The pseudophakia and posterior capsular opacification are incidental findings.

The computed tomographic scan shows a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland. The mass is non-enhancing, which suggests that it is not a vascular lesion. The lack of lytic bone changes or bone remodeling also suggests that the mass is not a malignant tumor.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's mass includes benign tumors such as a pleomorphic adenoma, a hemangioma, and a lymphangioma, as well as malignant tumors such as a lymphoma and a sarcoma.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain additional imaging, such as an MRI scan, to better characterize the mass. An MRI scan will be able to provide more information about the size, shape, and location of the mass, as well as its relationship to the surrounding structures. This information will be helpful in determining the appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Title: Unusual Cause of Ptosis Case is: A 35-year-old woman presented with painless ptosis of the left upper eyelid and intermittent diplopia in all gazes (Figure 1). Her new-onset acquired ptosis began 10 months prior. She had no history of ocular disease or trauma, and her medical history was notable for resection of a benign thyroid mass 3 years prior. Family and social history were unremarkable. Her vision was 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. She had mild anisocoria with the right and left pupils reacting from 6 to 4 mm and from 5 to 3 mm, respectively. The pupils were equal in light and dark, with no reversal after apraclonidine hydrochloride treatment. No relative afferent pupillary defect was noted. Results of the Hertel testing at a base measurement of 100 mm were 20.5 mm OD and 21.0 mm OS. She had full ductions and versions, mild fullness of the left superior sulcus, and no sensory deficits in her facial cranial nerves. Her vertical palpebral fissure measured 10 mm OD and 7 mm OS. Her margin-to-reflex distance was 4 mm OD and 2 mm OS. With phenylephrine hydrochloride, her margin-to-reflex distance became equal at 4 mm OS. She had no lagophthalmos. Results of anterior slitlamp and dilated ophthalmoscopic examinations were unremarkable.Preoperative photograph of the patient showing ptosis of the left upper eyelid.Check myasthenia laboratory findings and commence pyridostigmine trialMagnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomographic imaging of the orbitsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with myasthenia gravis. The most common cause of acquired ptosis is myasthenia gravis, a disorder of the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This prevents the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. Ptosis is the most common ocular manifestation of myasthenia gravis, affecting up to 80% of patients. The ptosis is typically bilateral and worse in the morning. It may be accompanied by other signs of myasthenia gravis, such as diplopia, facial weakness, and dysphagia. The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is confirmed with a Tensilon (edrophonium) test. This test is performed by injecting a small amount of Tensilon into a vein. The Tensilon temporarily improves the muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Treatment of myasthenia gravis is with medications that suppress the immune system, such as pyridostigmine (Mestinon) and prednisone. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve the ptosis.

Title: Hemifacial Hyperhidrosis in a Patient With an Apical Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer Case is: A middle-aged man with a 25-pack-year history of cigarette smoking was in his usual state of health when he developed excessive coughing with hemoptysis, which spontaneously resolved. Two months later, he presented to a hospital with complaint of shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. A computed tomographic image of the chest (Figure 1) identified a large, 12-cm left upper lobe mass abutting the anterior chest wall pleura and extending into the mediastinum, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as several liver lesions. A biopsy revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with a primary tumor in the lung. On presentation to our multidisciplinary clinic, he reported constant, bothersome sweating of the left forehead.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a middle-aged man with a 25-pack-year history of cigarette smoking who presented with a large, 12-cm left upper lobe mass abutting the anterior chest wall pleura and extending into the mediastinum, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as several liver lesions.

On presentation to our multidisciplinary clinic, he reported constant, bothersome sweating of the left forehead. On physical examination, a well-demarcated area of erythematous, perspiring skin on the left forehead was noted.

The left sympathetic trunk is a chain of nerve fibers that runs along the left side of the neck and thorax. It is responsible for controlling sweating, blood pressure, and heart rate. Impingement of the left sympathetic trunk can cause ipsilateral (same-side) hemifacial hyperhidrosis, as in this case.

The other answer choices are not supported by the clinical presentation. Cervical spinal cord compression can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and pain in the arms and legs. Right cervical ganglion invasion would not cause hemifacial hyperhidrosis. Transection of the left sympathetic trunk would cause ipsilateral anhydrosis, not hyperhidrosis.

Title: Wide Complex Tachycardia and Syncope in a Middle-aged Woman Case is: A woman in her late 40s with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department after multiple episodes of palpitations with near syncope. While in the emergency department, she developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. She continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. She was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement.

The patient is a woman in her late 40s with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department after multiple episodes of palpitations with near syncope. While in the emergency department, she developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. She continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. She was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement. The presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. The ECG shows a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block pattern. This is consistent with the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's age, sex, and lack of structural heart disease are favorable prognostic factors for her arrhythmia. However, the fact that she had sustained VT with hemodynamic instability is a concerning finding. This suggests that she is at risk for sudden cardiac death.

The treatment of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is aimed at preventing sudden cardiac death. The first-line treatment is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). An ICD is a device that is implanted in the chest and that can deliver an electric shock to terminate ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

In some cases, an electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation may be recommended. An electrophysiology study is a procedure in which catheters are inserted into the heart to map the electrical activity of the heart. Catheter ablation is a procedure in which radiofrequency energy is used to destroy the areas of the heart that are responsible for the arrhythmia.

In the patient's case, I would recommend placement of an ICD. The patient is at risk for sudden cardiac death, and an ICD is the most effective way to prevent sudden cardiac death.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a previously healthy 18-year-old woman with a 4-month history of a growth in the right oropharynx. The growth has been causing changes in her voice, globus sensation, and dysphagia. She has also lost 20 pounds over the past 3 months and has decreased appetite. She denies any associated difficulty breathing, pain, fever, chills, rash, or night sweats. She is a nonsmoker and nondrinker.

The planned procedure occurred without difficulty or complication. The specimen excised was a 6 × 3 × 2-cm mass continuous with the right tonsil, without involvement of any surrounding structures.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is a squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil. This is a relatively rare malignancy, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers in the United States. However, it is the most common type of cancer of the head and neck in patients younger than 40 years old.

The risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil include tobacco use, alcohol use, and Epstein-Barr virus infection. The disease is typically diagnosed in patients in their fifth or sixth decade of life. The most common presenting symptom is a sore throat that does not improve with treatment. Other symptoms may include a lump in the neck, difficulty swallowing, and bleeding from the mouth.

The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil is made by biopsy. The treatment for this cancer depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, the treatment may consist of surgery alone. In more advanced disease, the treatment may consist of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The prognosis for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil is variable. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with this cancer is approximately 60%. However, the survival rate is significantly higher for patients with early-stage disease.

Title: A Unified Cause of Cranial Polyneuropathy Case is: A healthy man in his mid 30s residing in the northeastern United States was seen by his primary care physician in mid-June with a 2-week history of flulike symptoms. He was empirically started on doxycycline because he reported frequenting wooded areas.One week later, he developed a complete right facial nerve paralysis. He was started on a course of prednisone, with subsequent full recovery of facial nerve function. About 2 weeks later, he reported new-onset right-sided hearing loss, tinnitus, and intermittent otalgia. He was evaluated in the otology clinic approximately 3 weeks after the onset of these otologic symptoms. He had no prior otologic history and no history of noise exposure. His otologic and head and neck examination findings were unremarkable.Comprehensive audiometry was performed, which showed a mild sensorineural hearing loss from 3000 to 8000 Hz in the right ear and a mild sensorineural hearing loss at 8000 Hz only in the left ear.

The most common manifestation of neuroborreliosis is Lyme meningitis, which is characterized by headache, fever, meningismus, and cranial nerve palsies. Other manifestations of neuroborreliosis can include facial nerve palsy, encephalitis, radiculitis, and peripheral neuropathy.

The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. The most sensitive laboratory test for neuroborreliosis is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the ELISA can be falsely positive in patients with other infections, such as Lyme disease. The Western blot is a more specific test for neuroborreliosis, but it is not as sensitive as the ELISA. Imaging studies, such as MRI, can be helpful in diagnosing neuroborreliosis, but they are not specific for the disease.

The treatment of neuroborreliosis is with antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics for neuroborreliosis are intravenous penicillin G or ceftriaxone. The duration of treatment is typically 14 to 21 days.

Title: Newborn With a Sublingual Mass Case is: A 1-week-old, full-term male newborn presented with increasingly labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements. He had been born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, during which routine prenatal ultrasonography had not detected any anatomical abnormalities or lesions. On physical examination, there were no abnormalities other than symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum present in the submental area (Figure, A). The tongue was displaced posteriorly and superiorly. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and face performed shortly after presentation showed a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle (Figure, B-D). The intrinsic muscles of the tongue appeared minimally displaced without obvious infiltration; however, the genioglossus muscle was difficult to locate relative to the mass. A thin-walled, multiloculated lesion was identified, measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm. The mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There were no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion.A, Appearance of the submental neck.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 1-week-old male newborn with a sublingual mass. The mass is bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging and does not enhance with intravenous gadolinium. There are no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications. When in-phase and out-of-phase images were compared, there was no significant signal intensity drop, suggesting an absence of fat within the lesion.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of macrocystic lymphatic malformation (MLM). MLMs are benign congenital malformations of the lymphatic system that are characterized by the presence of multiple cysts filled with lymph fluid. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the head and neck region.

The imaging findings in this case are classic for MLM. The mass is bright on T2-weighted imaging due to the presence of high-protein lymph fluid. It is dark on T1-weighted imaging due to the absence of free water. The mass does not enhance with intravenous gadolinium, which is consistent with the lack of blood vessels within the lesion. There are no obvious fluid-fluid levels or calcifications, which are findings that would be more concerning for a cystic teratoma. The absence of a significant signal intensity drop on in-phase and out-of-phase images suggests that the mass does not contain fat, which is another finding that would be more concerning for a dermoid cyst.

**Answer:**

The correct diagnosis is A: Macrocystic lymphatic malformation.

Title: Sweat Chloride Testing Case is: A 5-year-old girl was referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic for chronic constipation and poor weight gain. During her first week of life, she developed diarrhea and vomiting. With initiation of solid food, she developed laxative-dependent constipation. She underwent newborn genetic screening before routine cystic fibrosis (CF) screening. Results were normal. At the time of presentation to the gastroenterology clinic, she had no respiratory symptoms. Results of anorectal manometry, spinal magnetic resonance imaging, and thyroid studies were normal. Family history included constipation in a sister and a great aunt with CF. Her body mass index (BMI) was below the third percentile (eFigureA in the Supplement). Physical examination findings were unremarkable, including normal respiratory examination. Fecal elastase level was within reference range (>500 μg/g); abdominal computed tomographic image revealed a dilated, tortuous sigmoid colon; and full-thickness rectal biopsy was negative for Hirschsprung disease. She was referred for sweat chloride testing to assess for CF. Results of 3 separate sweat chloride tests were indeterminate (Table), prompting pulmonology referral. A 97-mutation CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) analysis panel was negative. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed 1 CF-causing mutation (c.2249C>T) and 2 likely benign variants (c.1408A>G and c.2562T>G).No further testing; the patient does not have CFWhat Would You Do Next? A: Additional genetic testing , B: Alternative CFTR functional testing , C: Repeat sweat chloride analysis , D: No further testing; the patient does not have CF. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient is a 5-year-old girl with a history of chronic constipation and poor weight gain. She has a family history of CF, and her newborn genetic screening was normal. She underwent sweat chloride testing, which was indeterminate. A 97-mutation CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) analysis panel was negative. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed 1 CF-causing mutation (c.2249C>T) and 2 likely benign variants (c.1408A>G and c.2562T>G).

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with CF, but her genetic testing results are inconclusive. The indeterminate sweat chloride test result could be due to a false-negative result, or it could be due to the patient having a mild form of CF. The negative CFTR analysis panel result does not rule out CF, as there are many CF-causing mutations that are not included in this panel. The whole-genome sequence analysis result is the most definitive test for CF, and it reveals that the patient has 1 CF-causing mutation. However, the presence of 2 likely benign variants could also explain the patient's clinical presentation.

Given the patient's clinical presentation, genetic testing results, and family history, I would recommend additional genetic testing to look for other CF-causing mutations. I would also recommend alternative CFTR functional testing, such as nasal potential difference testing or sweat chloride testing. If these tests are negative, I would recommend a repeat sweat chloride analysis. If the repeat sweat chloride analysis is also negative, I would recommend no further testing; the patient does not have CF.

A. Additional genetic testing

Title: Blurry Vision and a Black Ink Tattoo Case is: A 26-year-old white man presented for evaluation of blurry vision over the past year. He had no back or joint pain or skin rashes. Five years ago he had a black ink tattoo placed on his left arm, and 3 years ago a second tattoo was placed on his right arm. Two years after the right arm tattoo was placed, he noticed tattoo elevation on the left arm and onset of decreased vision. He had recurrent episodes of ocular redness and blurred vision, coincident with inflammation of the skin surrounding both tattoos. Two months before presentation, bilateral peripheral iridotomies (iris laser procedures) were performed because of inflammation-induced adhesions between the iris and the lens (Figure, panel A).A, Slitlamp photograph of left eye. B, Tattooed skin on left arm. C, Hematoxylin-eosin stain of skin biopsy sample (original magnification ×100).At presentation, best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left. Intraocular pressure was 34 mm Hg in the right eye (upper limit of normal, 21 mm Hg) and 11 mm Hg in the left. On anterior segment slitlamp examination, there were no visible inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the right eye, but there were more than 26 cells per 1-mm field in the left. The left arm tattoo was elevated, with nodular elevation most prominent at the superior aspect of the tattoo (Figure, panel B). Punch biopsy of the tattooed skin revealed epithelioid histiocytes with macrophages containing coarse black granular pigment (Figure, panel C). Results of testing for syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis were negative.What Would You Do Next? A: Initiate topical steroid eyedrop therapy , B: Recommend removal of tattoos , C: Refer immediately to rheumatology , D: Perform surgical implantation of glaucoma drainage device. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of black ink tattoos, which are known to cause an inflammatory reaction in the skin. This inflammation can spread to the eye, causing inflammation and elevated intraocular pressure. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, and the skin biopsy confirms the presence of black ink pigment in the eye. The best course of treatment is to remove the tattoos, which will stop the inflammation and lower the intraocular pressure.

Title: A Fussy Infant With a Generalized Papulovesicular Rash Case is: A 7-week-old, previously healthy full-term male infant presented with a 4-week history of a worsening, widespread, papulopustulovesicular eruption, which began as scattered papulovesicles over the chest. The infant was born to a 31-year-old mother by normal vaginal delivery. The mother had a benign prenatal course during pregnancy. Since the rash developed, the infant had been fussy with increasing restlessness at night. The parents denied any personal or family history of rash. On further questioning, the parents reported that the infant had had contact with a babysitter who reported pruritus, especially at night. The sitter had provided domestic care for the infant since birth until leaving that position 3 weeks earlier.On examination, the infant was afebrile with normal vital signs. Multiple disseminated, edematous, pin-sized, papulopustulovesicles and 5- to 10-mm coalescing, crusted nodules were found all over the body; some with oval to elongated, serpiginous or J-shaped burrows (Figure 1). No excoriations were visible. A Tzanck smear showed no multinucleated giant cells in the pustular contents. A Gram stain and potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of the pustular contents showed no bacterial or fungal elements. Cultures of the pustular contents yielded no bacterial or fungal growth. The differential of a complete blood cell count showed 12% eosinophils. Results of other routine laboratory investigations were unremarkable.Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sitesWhat Would You Do Next? A: Administer intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics , B: Start a topical steroid , C: Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites , D: Do nothing and reassure the parents. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is scabies, a contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is characterized by a papular, vesicular, and crusted eruption that is often pruritic. The rash is typically found in intertriginous areas, such as the wrists, elbows, axillae, groin, and buttocks. In infants, the rash may also be found on the palms, soles, and scalp.

The differential diagnosis for scabies includes other papular and vesicular rashes, such as varicella zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and impetigo. However, the history of contact with a babysitter who reported pruritus, especially at night, as well as the distribution of the rash in intertriginous areas, is highly suggestive of scabies.

The next step in the management of this case is to perform skin scrapings from multiple sites to confirm the diagnosis of scabies. If the skin scrapings are positive for scabies, the infant can be treated with a topical scabicide, such as permethrin cream or lindane lotion. The infant's bedding and clothing should also be washed to prevent the spread of the infection.

Title: Disseminated Vegetating Plaques and Pustules Case is: A teenaged male presented with a 2-week history of vegetating, bleeding plaques and pustules on his face, scalp, trunk, and extremities. He reported that lesions began as pustules and developed into painful, itchy plaques. Before evaluation at a referral hospital in Kenya, the patient was treated with prednisolone tablet 5 mg twice daily, clindamycin hydrochloride 300 mg daily, and fluconazole 200 mg daily, but he continued to develop new lesions. A complete review of systems was notable for the patient’s difficulty with walking because of skin lesions. On examination, pustules and hemorrhagic-crusted plaques were seen on the scalp, legs, arms, and trunk along with keloidal plaques on the face (Figure, A and B). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for HIV was negative. A punch biopsy specimen from the arm was obtained for histopathologic study (Figure, C and D).Extensive vegetative plaques with bleeding and ulceration on extremities (A), and pustules and ulcerated plaques on extremities and trunk (B).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pyoderma gangrenosum, blastomycosis, pyoderma vegetans, and halogenoderma. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non-infectious skin disease characterized by painful, necrotic skin lesions. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, as well as other symptoms, such as fever, cough, and weight loss. Pyoderma vegetans is a rare, chronic skin disease characterized by vegetating plaques on the skin. It is often associated with Crohn's disease. Halogenoderma is a skin condition that can be caused by exposure to certain halogens, such as chlorine and bromine. It is characterized by hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and desquamation.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient's skin lesions are painful, necrotic, and associated with underlying systemic disease. The patient's biopsy specimen shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, which is a characteristic finding in pyoderma gangrenosum.

The lesions are symmetric and bilateral, located especially on the malar and preauricular areas, with a diameter of 5 to 10 mm. The skin lesions are not indurated and display no epidermal changes. The patient denied experiencing previous inflammation. He has no history of chicken pox or acne or traumatic lesions in those areas. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for further evaluation.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes primary anetoderma, atrophoderma vermiculata, atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis, and facial morphea. Primary anetoderma is a rare, idiopathic disorder characterized by the development of atrophic, well-demarcated skin lesions. The lesions are typically located on the face, trunk, and extremities, and they may be associated with pruritus. Atrophoderma vermiculata is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by the development of small, atrophic, verrucous lesions on the face. The lesions are typically located on the cheeks, nose, and forehead, and they may be associated with pruritus and xerosis. Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by the development of small, atrophic, hypopigmented lesions on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are typically located on the sun-exposed areas of the skin, and they may be associated with pruritus and xerosis. Facial morphea is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder characterized by the development of indurated plaques on the face. The plaques are typically located on the cheeks, forehead, and nose, and they may be associated with atrophy, telangiectasias, and hypopigmentation.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is primary anetoderma. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of persistent round lesions with a scar-like appearance on his face. The lesions are symmetric and bilateral, located especially on the malar and preauricular areas, with a diameter of 5 to 10 mm. The skin lesions are not indurated and display no epidermal changes.

Title: Erythematous Papule on the Glans Penis Case is: A 60-year-old man with a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma was referred to our department. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma 2 years earlier after discovery of osteolytic bone lesions of the skull and the findings of a bone marrow biopsy. The patient had been treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous blood progenitor cell transplantation, which resulted in complete response. At the time of the consultation, he was free of disease.The patient was referred for evaluation of an indolent, erythematous papule on his glans penis of 2 weeks’ duration. He denied sexual risk behavior and reported no recent changes in medication. Careful physical examination revealed a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the glans (Figure 1A). There were no other skin lesions. The lymph nodes were not palpable, and there was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C).A, Shiny, erythematous, hemispherical papule on the lateral aspect of the glans penis.

The correct answer is D: Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.

Reasoning:

* The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic cancer that results in the production of abnormal plasma cells. These plasma cells can deposit amyloid, a protein that can build up in tissues and organs, causing damage.
* The patient has an indolent, erythematous papule on his glans penis. This is a common presentation of primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.
* The physical examination reveals a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the glans. This is also a common presentation of primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.
* The lymph nodes are not palpable, and there is no organomegaly. This is consistent with a localized process such as primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.
* A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation. The histopathological findings show a nodular deposit of amyloid in the dermis. This is the characteristic finding of primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathological findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.

The most likely diagnosis is Amyand hernia (appendix included within the inguinal hernia sac). This is a rare condition that occurs when the appendix is included in an inguinal hernia. The appendix is a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon. It is located in the right lower abdomen.

The symptoms of Amyand hernia are similar to those of other types of inguinal hernias. They include pain, swelling, and a lump in the groin. However, Amyand hernias are more likely to cause urinary problems, such as increased frequency, urgency, and difficulty voiding.

The diagnosis of Amyand hernia is made with a physical examination and imaging tests, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the appendix and repair the hernia.

Title: Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy Case is: A healthy 29-year-old pregnant woman, with 34 weeks’ gestational age, presented to the emergency department with diffused acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain was located in the periumbilical region and intensified within a few hours. The patient felt normal fetal movements during this time. An initial surgical evaluation was done, and the cause for the abdominal pain was assumed to be not of surgical condition. Next, the patient was evaluated by an obstetrician-gynecologist, and although the gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and monitoring were all normal, the patient was admitted for further supervision in the obstetrics department. The next day, when the abdominal pain and vomiting persisted and an elevated leukocyte blood count of 14 200/mL was noted (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), a second surgical consultation was done. The physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness. Although the patient was pregnant, and owing to nonavailability of magnetic resonance imaging at that time, a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed (Figure 1).Coronal computed tomographic image showing an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, with uterus and head of fetus in the pelvis.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a healthy 29-year-old pregnant woman, with 34 weeks’ gestational age, who presented to the emergency department with diffused acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain was located in the periumbilical region and intensified within a few hours. The patient felt normal fetal movements during this time. An initial surgical evaluation was done, and the cause for the abdominal pain was assumed to be not of surgical condition. Next, the patient was evaluated by an obstetrician-gynecologist, and although the gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and monitoring were all normal, the patient was admitted for further supervision in the obstetrics department. The next day, when the abdominal pain and vomiting persisted and an elevated leukocyte blood count of 14 200/mL was noted (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), a second surgical consultation was done. The physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness. Although the patient was pregnant, and owing to nonavailability of magnetic resonance imaging at that time, a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed (Figure 1).

The coronal computed tomographic image (Figure 1) shows an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, with uterus and head of fetus in the pelvis. This finding is consistent with ileo-colic intussusception.

Ileo-colic intussusception is a condition in which a segment of the small intestine telescopes into the next segment. It is a common cause of bowel obstruction in children, but it can also occur in adults. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is usually surgical.

In this case, the patient is a healthy 29-year-old pregnant woman. She presented with acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain was located in the periumbilical region and intensified within a few hours. The patient felt normal fetal movements during this time. An initial surgical evaluation was done, and the cause for the abdominal pain was assumed to be not of surgical condition. Next, the patient was evaluated by an obstetrician-gynecologist, and although the gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and monitoring were all normal, the patient was admitted for further supervision in the obstetrics department. The next day, when the abdominal pain and vomiting persisted and an elevated leukocyte blood count of 14 200/mL was noted (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), a second surgical consultation was done. The physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness. Although the patient was pregnant, and owing to nonavailability of magnetic resonance imaging at that time, a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed (Figure 1).

The coronal computed tomographic image (Figure 1) shows an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, with uterus and head of fetus in the pelvis. This finding is consistent with ileo-colic intussusception.

The differential diagnosis for ileo-colic intussusception includes Crohn's ileitis, foreign body ingestion, and adenocarcinoma of small intestine. However, the patient's age, presentation, and imaging findings are most consistent with ileo-colic intussusception.

Therefore, the diagnosis is ileo-colic intussusception.

**Reasoning:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of posterior CMV retinitis. This is a common complication of liver transplantation, occurring in up to 20% of patients. The most common presenting symptoms are blurred vision, floaters, and photopsias. On examination, there is typically an area of retinal necrosis with hemorrhage and exudates. The diagnosis is confirmed with fundus examination and vitreous biopsy.

The treatment of posterior CMV retinitis is with intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet. These drugs are effective in killing the virus, but they must be given for a prolonged period of time (usually 4-6 weeks) to prevent recurrence. In some cases, intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet may be used as an alternative to intravenous therapy.

In the patient described, the most likely cause of his central scotoma is posterior CMV retinitis. The patient's history of liver transplantation, positive CMV serology, and recent onset of blurred vision are all consistent with this diagnosis. The fundus photograph shows an area of retinal necrosis with hemorrhage and exudates, which is characteristic of posterior CMV retinitis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to start intravenous ganciclovir treatment. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of progression of the retinitis, such as worsening visual acuity or the development of new retinal lesions. If the retinitis does not respond to intravenous ganciclovir, intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet may be necessary.

**Answer:**
C. Perform a vitreous tap and administer intravenous ganciclovir treatment

Title: Choroidal Infiltrate of Unknown Cause Case is: A woman in her late 50s reported right eye visual field changes. Review of medical history revealed lumpectomy and radiotherapy for breast cancer 6 years prior. Visual acuity was 20/160 OD (her baseline due to amblyopia) and 20/20 OS. Pupillary function was normal. The anterior chamber and vitreous were quiet. Fundus photographs showed optic nerve edema and a peripapillary choroidal infiltrate in the right eye. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated retinal thickening with cystoid abnormalities, subretinal hyperreflective material consistent with fibrosis, and choroidal thickening in the right eye (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve head in the right eye demonstrated 360° peripapillary nerve fiber thickening and diffuse nerve head elevation. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated staining with minimal leakage in the temporal peripapillary retina of the right eye.A, Fundus photography of the right eye revealed optic nerve edema and a peripapillary choroidal infiltrate. The line marks the location of the cut through the retina represented by the optical coherence tomography (OCT). B, Swept-source OCT of the right eye demonstrated retinal thickening with cystoid abnormalities, subretinal fibrosis, and choroidal thickening in the area marked on the fundus photo.Testing results for an underlying neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious process were unrevealing, including negative results of serology tests for tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, and sarcoidosis. Results of complete blood cell count, serum protein electrophoresis, and bone marrow biopsy were not supportive of lymphoproliferative disease. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits were normal. Computed tomographic scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated no lymphadenopathy.Four months prior to presentation, routine electrocardiogram demonstrated a right bundle branch block. Eight months later, complete heart block necessitated urgent pacemaker implantation.What Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient in this case has a choroidal infiltrate of unknown cause. She has a history of breast cancer, which puts her at increased risk for metastasis to the eye. However, there is no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging or serological testing. The patient also has a history of a right bundle branch block, which is a conduction abnormality in the heart. This could be a sign of infiltrative cardiomyopathy, which is a type of heart disease that can be caused by metastasis from cancer.

Given the patient's history and presentation, it is important to rule out metastatic disease to the eye and the heart. The next step in management should be to obtain a chorioretinal biopsy to determine the underlying cause of the choroidal infiltrate. If the biopsy reveals metastatic disease, then treatment should be directed at the underlying cancer. If the biopsy is negative, then the patient should be monitored for signs of progression of the choroidal infiltrate.

Title: Blurred Vision and Wrinkled Retinas in an Elderly Man Case is: A 64-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 2 months of progressively worsening vision in both eyes. The worsening vision was preceded by binocular diplopia, which was intermittent at first and then became constant. He had no relevant ocular or other medical history. A review of systems was notable for a 2-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. He denied any fevers, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. Visual acuity was found to be 20/200 OD and 20/25 OS. His pupils were round and equally reactive, and there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. On external examination, bilateral proptosis and increased resistance to retropulsion was observed. There was very limited extraocular motility in all directions of gaze on the right side and moderately limited extraocular motility on the left side. In addition, the patient had an esotropia and right hypertropia. Anterior segment examination revealed bilateral chemosis. The fundus examination (Figure 1) showed chorioretinal folds in both eyes and intraretinal hemorrhages in the right eye. The optic discs had normal color and sharp margins bilaterally.A, Fundus photograph of the right eye showing prominent chorioretinal folds throughout the macula and 2 intraretinal hemorrhages near the vascular arcades.

Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with Graves' orbitopathy, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the orbit, which can lead to proptosis, extraocular muscle dysfunction, and vision loss. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits is the best initial test to evaluate the extent of the inflammation and to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor or infection. Once the diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy is confirmed, the patient can be started on treatment with corticosteroids and/or orbital radiation therapy.

Title: Bilateral Sequential Acute Proptosis in a Woman With No History of Trauma Case is: A woman in her early 30s presented with acute onset of painful proptosis of the right eye and mild epistaxis with no inciting trauma. Her medical history was notable for hypertension, treated with clonidine hydrochloride, and opiate abuse, treated with methadone hydrochloride. Her blood pressure was 138/87 mm Hg. The patient was afebrile with no leukocytosis. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU with no afferent pupillary defect and normal intraocular pressures. Examination revealed periorbital edema, proptosis, and limitation in supraduction, abduction, and adduction in the right eye. There was no periorbital soft-tissue erythema, warmth, or tenderness to palpation. Computed tomography showed hyperattenuating soft tissue in the superior, medial, and inferior right orbit (Figure 1A, arrowheads). Magnetic resonance imaging showed no internal flow voids to suggest vascular malformation. Results of a laboratory workup revealed mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (49 mm/h; reference range, 0-20 mm/h) and antinuclear antibody titer (1:80; reference range, <1:40) as well as positive results for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Results of further autoimmune and infectious workup were negative. Two weeks later, new proptosis and periocular edema of the left eye developed, with no inciting trauma. Her examination results were significant for proptosis, periorbital edema, and limitation in supraduction in the left eye. Computed tomography showed new hyperattenuating soft tissue in the left superior and lateral orbit (Figure 1B, arrowhead).A, Coronal contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan shows hyperattenuating soft tissue in the superior, medial, and inferior subperiosteal space of the right orbit (arrowheads). B, Computed tomographic scan, not contrast enhanced, shows hyperattenuating orbital soft tissue in the left orbit (arrowhead).What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case presents with bilateral sequential acute proptosis, a rare and potentially vision-threatening condition. The differential diagnosis for this condition is broad and includes a number of both benign and malignant processes. In order to narrow the differential diagnosis and determine the most appropriate course of treatment, it is important to obtain a thorough history and physical examination, as well as relevant laboratory and imaging studies.

In this case, the patient's history is significant for hypertension, opiate abuse, and bilateral sequential acute proptosis. The patient's physical examination reveals periorbital edema, proptosis, and limitation in supraduction, abduction, and adduction in both eyes. There is no periorbital soft-tissue erythema, warmth, or tenderness to palpation. Computed tomography shows hyperattenuating soft tissue in the superior, medial, and inferior right orbit, as well as the left superior and lateral orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging shows no internal flow voids to suggest vascular malformation. Results of a laboratory workup reveal mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (49 mm/h) and antinuclear antibody titer (1:80), as well as positive results for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Results of further autoimmune and infectious workup are negative.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bilateral idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (B-IIOS). B-IIOS is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory condition of the orbit that can affect both eyes. The exact cause of B-IIOS is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. The clinical presentation of B-IIOS can vary, but it typically includes proptosis, periorbital edema, pain, and limitation of extraocular movements. The diagnosis of B-IIOS is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings. There is no specific treatment for B-IIOS, but it is often managed with a combination of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and pain medication.

In the case of this patient, the most appropriate course of treatment is empirical corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents that can help to reduce the inflammation and swelling associated with B-IIOS. Corticosteroids can be administered orally, intravenously, or by injection into the orbit. In some cases, immunosuppressive agents may also be necessary to control the inflammation. Pain medication can be used to help relieve the pain associated with B-IIOS.

Title: A Woman With Fluctuating Left Eye Swelling and Redness Case is: A 63-year-old healthy woman presented with a 3-week history of fluctuating left eye swelling and redness. She also reported a 1-week history of left eye discomfort and left-sided tinnitus and a 1-day history of binocular horizontal diplopia. She denied any history of recent trauma. Ophthalmologic examination at the time revealed visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 21 mm Hg OS, with a widened pulse pressure of the left eye. Extraocular motility revealed a left eye abduction deficit. Pupils and confrontational visual fields were unremarkable. Hertel measured 16 mm and 17 mm, respectively. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, but examination of the left eye revealed a large subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins (Figure 1). Fundus examination of both eyes was unremarkable.Clinical photographs taken 3 weeks apart. A, Dilated nasal episcleral vessels and conjunctival chemosis near the onset of the patient’s symptoms.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's symptoms are concerning for a possible orbital apex syndrome, which is a constellation of signs and symptoms that result from compression of the orbital apex. The orbital apex is a small space in the skull that contains the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, the oculomotor nerve, the trochlear nerve, the abducens nerve, the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, the superior ophthalmic vein, and the cavernous sinus. Compression of the orbital apex can result in a variety of symptoms, including visual loss, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, headache, and facial numbness.

The patient in this case presents with several of the classic symptoms of an orbital apex syndrome, including fluctuating left eye swelling and redness, a 1-week history of left eye discomfort and left-sided tinnitus, and a 1-day history of binocular horizontal diplopia. The patient also has a widened pulse pressure of the left eye, which is a sign of increased intracranial pressure.

In order to further evaluate the patient, I would order a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. A CT scan can help to identify any structural abnormalities that may be compressing the orbital apex. If the CT scan is normal, I would then order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. An MRI can provide more detailed information about the soft tissues of the orbit and can help to identify any tumors or other abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

If the CT scan or MRI shows evidence of a mass lesion or other abnormality that is compressing the orbital apex, I would urgently refer the patient to neurosurgery. Neurosurgery is the specialty of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. A neurosurgeon would be able to provide the patient with the best possible care for her condition.

Title: New Onset of Blurred Vision and Floaters Case is: A 38-year-old man with a history of refractive surgery in both eyes and well-controlled HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (CD4+ lymphocyte count, 881) presented with worsening blurry vision and floaters in the left eye for 3 weeks in the setting of sinus congestion and left-sided jaw pain for 6 months. He denied flashing lights, visual field defects, trauma, pain, redness, discharge, or other systemic symptoms.On examination, the patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS (no improvement on refraction), his pupils were equally round and reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, his intraocular pressures were normal, and extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full. Results from slitlamp and dilated fundus examinations of the right eye were normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye showed mild fine keratic precipitates and pigmented cell; dilated fundus examination showed significant vitritis but no obvious vascular sheathing or chorioretinal lesions (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the macula confirmed there was no intraretinal or subretinal fluid (Figure 1B), and fluorescein angiography did not show any vascular leakage or areas of nonperfusion. Results of further workup showed normal complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel laboratory testing, undetectable HIV viral load, and unremarkable chest radiography; laboratory results for tuberculosis (T-SPOT.TB testing), syphilis (rapid plasma reagin with reflex treponemal testing), cytoplasmic and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and blood cultures were all negative as well.A, On color fundus photography, significant vitreous haze obscuring most of the retinal vessels was observed in the left eye, but no apparent chorioretinal lesions were seen.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of refractive surgery in both eyes and well-controlled HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (CD4+ lymphocyte count, 881) who presented with worsening blurry vision and floaters in the left eye for 3 weeks in the setting of sinus congestion and left-sided jaw pain for 6 months. He denied flashing lights, visual field defects, trauma, pain, redness, discharge, or other systemic symptoms.

On examination, the patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS (no improvement on refraction), his pupils were equally round and reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, his intraocular pressures were normal, and extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full. Results from slitlamp and dilated fundus examinations of the right eye were normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye showed mild fine keratic precipitates and pigmented cell; dilated fundus examination showed significant vitritis but no obvious vascular sheathing or chorioretinal lesions (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the macula confirmed there was no intraretinal or subretinal fluid (Figure 1B), and fluorescein angiography did not show any vascular leakage or areas of nonperfusion. Results of further workup showed normal complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel laboratory testing, undetectable HIV viral load, and unremarkable chest radiography; laboratory results for tuberculosis (T-SPOT.TB testing), syphilis (rapid plasma reagin with reflex treponemal testing), cytoplasmic and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and blood cultures were all negative as well.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes infectious causes such as viral retinitis (e.g., cytomegalovirus retinitis, toxoplasmosis), fungal retinitis (e.g., candidiasis, cryptococcosis), and tuberculosis; noninfectious causes such as sarcoidosis, idiopathic inflammatory orbital syndrome, and multiple sclerosis; and masquerade syndromes such as neoplasms and vasculitis.

Given the patient's history of HIV and the presence of vitritis, viral retinitis is a particularly concerning possibility. However, the patient's negative laboratory results for common infectious causes make this diagnosis less likely. Sarcoidosis is another possibility, given the patient's sinus congestion and jaw pain. However, the patient's normal chest radiography makes this diagnosis less likely as well.

In the absence of a clear diagnosis, the next step in management is to perform head/maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will help to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. If the CT or MRI is negative, then the patient may be started on a course of topical or systemic steroids. Steroids can be helpful in treating a variety of inflammatory conditions, including sarcoidosis, idiopathic inflammatory orbital syndrome, and multiple sclerosis.

If the patient's symptoms do not improve with steroids, then further workup may be necessary, including vitreous biopsy. Vitreous biopsy can be used to diagnose infectious and noninfectious causes of vitritis.

Title: Bilateral Lower Extremity Skin Eruptions in an HIV-Positive Man Receiving Pembrolizumab Monotherapy for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer Case is: A black man in his 30s presented for evaluation of papules and plaques on his bilateral lower extremities. Nine months before the current presentation, he was treated with intramuscular penicillin for syphilis. His medical history was also significant for HIV, for which he was receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, and metastatic programmed cell death ligand 1–positive squamous non–small cell lung cancer. Four months before the current presentation, the patient had started pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment for his cancer. One month before this presentation, multiple ulcers developed on his buccal mucosa, as well as a nonpainful shallow penile ulcer and pruritic, mildly painful, hyperpigmented papules and plaques on the bilateral soles of his feet in a pattern identical to previous syphilitic eruption. The patient denied fever, chills, and weight loss. Physical examination revealed multiple hyperpigmented papules and plaques with violaceous borders on his bilateral soles and lateral feet (Figure, A) and scattered, violaceous papules and nodules with overlying scale on his bilateral lower extremities. He was referred to the dermatology service, and a punch biopsy specimen was obtained from the right medial sole (Figure, B).A, Right foot with multiple hyperpigmented, lichenified papules, and plaques with violaceous borders. B, A punch biopsy specimen from the right medial sole. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells can be seen within the infiltrate (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×40).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Secondary syphilis , B: Lichen planus , C: Lichenoid drug reaction , D: Janeway lesions secondary to endocarditis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a black man in his 30s with a history of HIV, syphilis, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He is currently receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy. He presented with a new eruption of papules and plaques on his bilateral lower extremities. The eruption is pruritic, mildly painful, and hyperpigmented. It has a violaceous border and is identical to a previous syphilitic eruption.

The differential diagnosis for this eruption includes secondary syphilis, lichen planus, lichenoid drug reaction, and Janeway lesions secondary to endocarditis.

Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by a generalized rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise. The rash is typically maculopapular or papulosquamous and can involve the palms and soles. It may also be accompanied by condylomata lata, which are moist, warty lesions that typically occur in the anogenital region.

Lichen planus is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by flat, violaceous papules and plaques. The lesions are typically found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. They may be pruritic and sometimes painful.

A lichenoid drug reaction is a type of drug eruption that is characterized by a lichenoid eruption. Lichenoid eruptions are characterized by flat, violaceous papules and plaques. They are typically found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. They may be pruritic and sometimes painful.

Janeway lesions are small, nontender, erythematous macules or papules that occur on the palms and soles. They are a rare manifestation of endocarditis and are caused by septic emboli.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is secondary syphilis. This is supported by the patient's history of HIV, which is a risk factor for syphilis, and the appearance of the eruption, which is typical of secondary syphilis. The biopsy findings are also consistent with secondary syphilis.

The differential diagnosis includes lichen planus, lichenoid drug reaction, and Janeway lesions secondary to endocarditis. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

A computed tomographic examination of the brain showed a right frontal lobe abscess with vasogenic edema (Figure 1). She underwent burrhole aspiration of the abscess, which grew mixed oral flora. Treatment involved a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and medications for seizure prophylaxis.What Would You Do Next? A: Transesophageal echocardiogram , B: Computed tomographic imaging of the chest , C: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , D: Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a history of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair. These are congenital heart defects that can lead to right-to-left shunts, which can cause paradoxical embolism. Paradoxical embolism is a condition in which a blood clot that forms in the venous system travels to the arterial system and lodges in a small blood vessel, such as a cerebral artery. This can cause a stroke, such as the one that the patient in this case has.

A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a type of ultrasound that is performed through the esophagus. It is the most sensitive test for detecting right-to-left shunts. A TEE would be the best test to order in this case to rule out a right-to-left shunt as the cause of the patient's brain abscess.

Title: A Rare Case of a Nasopharyngeal Mass Case is: A man in his 50s with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of nasal congestion and epistaxis. Nonenhanced computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses revealed a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus (Figure 1A). The sella was apparently normal with no disruption of its floor. The intracranial and orbital soft tissues were grossly normal, as were the remaining soft tissues under the skull base.A, Sagittal nonenhanced computed tomography images of the paranasal sinus depicting a soft-tissue mass involving the sphenoid sinus, the nasopharynx, and the clivus. B, Postcontrast sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance shows avid enhancement of the mass; involvement of the clivus is also depicted.A magnetic resonance imaging study was also performed (Figure 1B). There was a lobulated mass centered to the nasopharynx, measuring about 2.8 × 2.6 × 4.5 cm (anteroposterior × transverse × craniocaudal planes, respectively) in maximal diameters.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 50s with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism. He presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of nasal congestion and epistaxis. Nonenhanced computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses reveals a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus. The sella was apparently normal with no disruption of its floor. The intracranial and orbital soft tissues were grossly normal, as were the remaining soft tissues under the skull base. A magnetic resonance imaging study was also performed. There was a lobulated mass centered to the nasopharynx, measuring about 2.8 × 2.6 × 4.5 cm (anteroposterior × transverse × craniocaudal planes, respectively) in maximal diameters. The mass demonstrated intermediate T2 hyperintense signal and avid postcontrast enhancement. It extended inferiorly down to the oropharynx and superiorly along the floor of the left sphenoid sinus with extension into the sinus itself; posteriorly, there were erosions involving the sphenoid bone and the clivus. The floor of sella was intact, and a normal enhancing pituitary gland and infundibulum were seen within the sella. No sellar or suprasellar mass was evident. Both Meckel caves were normal, and the cavernous sinuses were also normal and without evidence of asymmetric mass or abnormal enhancement. The patient underwent a total mass resection via endoscopic anterior cranial base approach, with extradural tumor resection, reconstruction of the skull base, and a nasoseptal flap.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. This is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells that line the nasopharynx. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer of the nasopharynx. It is more common in men than in women, and it is most often diagnosed in people in their 50s and 60s.

The symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people with the disease may have no symptoms at all, while others may have nasal congestion, epistaxis, facial pain, or hearing loss.

The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx is usually made with a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope.

The treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, the tumor may be treated with surgery alone. In more advanced disease, the tumor may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The prognosis for people with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx varies depending on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. The overall five-year survival rate for people with squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx is about 60%.

Title: An Indolent Middle Ear Mass Case is: A woman in her 30s presented with a 1-year history of left ear fullness. She reported diminished left-sided hearing that would temporarily improve with autoinsufflation. She denied facial numbness or weakness, and reported no dizziness or vertigo. Physical examination revealed a retrotympanic, nonpulsatile, tan-gray mass anterior to the malleus handle. A tuning fork examination revealed lateralization to the left ear and bone conduction louder than air conduction on the left side with a 512-Hz tuning fork. The remainder of the physical examination, including facial nerve function, was normal. An audiogram confirmed mild conductive hearing loss in the left ear. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a middle ear lesion lateral to the geniculate ganglion with possible extension into the peritubal space. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an enhancing lesion lateral to the geniculate ganglion (Figure, A-C). The patient was initially observed but then experienced progressive hearing loss that no longer improved with the Valsalva maneuver, persistent ear fullness, and rare facial twitching. The middle ear mass appeared enlarged on repeated MRI and began to obstruct the eustachian tube. Transcanal endoscopy demonstrated a gray middle ear mass occupying the anterior mesotympanum and epitympanum and extending into the eustachian tube (Figure, D). The tegmen was intact. The specimen revealed predominantly spindled stroma with a focus of tumor that was positive for antiepithelial membrane antigen and somatostatin receptor 2A.A, Noncontrast axial computed tomogram (CT) of the left temporal bone demonstrates an anterior mesotympanic mass lateral to the cochlea (yellow arrowhead) with blockage and extension into the supratubal recess (white arrowhead).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a jugulotympanic paraganglioma. Jugulotympanic paragangliomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the paraganglia, which are small collections of cells that are found throughout the body, including the head and neck. These tumors are often slow-growing and may not cause any symptoms for many years. However, as they grow, they can cause hearing loss, facial paralysis, and other problems.

The diagnosis of a jugulotympanic paraganglioma is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as CT or MRI. If a tumor is suspected, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of a jugulotympanic paraganglioma depends on the size and location of the tumor. Small tumors that do not cause any symptoms may be observed without treatment. However, larger tumors or tumors that are causing symptoms may need to be removed surgically. Radiation therapy may also be used to treat these tumors.

The prognosis for patients with jugulotympanic paragangliomas is generally good. With treatment, most patients can expect to live long and healthy lives.

Title: Anterior Nasal Cavity Mass in a Neonate Case is: A newborn twin girl was referred to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic at a tertiary pediatric hospital for evaluation of a left-sided nasal mass causing nasal obstruction and difficulty breathing, especially with feeding (Figure 1A). She was born at 36 weeks’ gestation and spent 10 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. Her parents noted that the lesion was present at birth and she always seemed congested on the left side. There was no report of clear drainage. Physical examination showed an approximately 1-cm, firm, pedunculated polypoid mass in the anterior nasal cavity at the vestibule. The base was located just anterior to the septum and encompassed nearly the entire left nasal cavity. There was no fluid in the mass, and there was a negative Furstenberg sign. Nasal endoscopy was performed in the clinic, and there were no additional masses or mucosal abnormalities. The choana was patent. The patient was also noted to have left eye ptosis and left preauricular branchial remnants but no other significant abnormalities on examination. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed (Figure 1B) and showed a 0.8 × 0.5–cm hyperintense mass on T1-weighted images, suggesting a fatty component and no intracranial tract.Photograph (A) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (B) of the left anterior nasal cavity mass.What Is Your Diagnosis?

No signs of cerebral atrophy were noticed. Genetic testing was advised but was declined.

The most likely diagnosis is xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight and a high risk of developing skin cancer. The disorder is caused by mutations in genes that repair damage to DNA caused by ultraviolet radiation. Patients with XP typically develop multiple skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma, at a young age. The skin lesions can be disfiguring and may lead to scarring. Other features of XP include photophobia, nystagmus, and developmental delay. There is no cure for XP, but early diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers can improve the prognosis.

The other possible diagnoses are trichothiodystrophy, Cockayne syndrome, and actinic keratosis. Trichothiodystrophy is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by brittle hair, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, and developmental delay. Cockayne syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, developmental delay, and sensitivity to sunlight. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin lesion that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma.

Based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is XP.

**Answer:**

The answer is C.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a rare genetic disorder that causes extreme sensitivity to sunlight. People with XP are at increased risk for developing skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The patient's facial lesions are consistent with basal cell carcinomas, which are the most common type of skin cancer. The patient's parents are first cousins, which increases the risk of the patient inheriting a genetic mutation that causes XP. The patient's intellectual development and lack of other systemic symptoms are also consistent with XP.

A high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scan of her chest revealed diffuse thin-walled pulmonary cysts without nodules, parenchymal changes, or lymphadenopathy. Imaging of her abdomen did not show kidney lesions or abdominal masses. The patient’s serum vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) level was elevated at 1300 pg/mL (reference range, <600 pg/mL).

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). LAM is a rare, progressive, cystic lung disease that occurs almost exclusively in women of reproductive age. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the lungs, which leads to the formation of thin-walled cysts. LAM can cause progressive dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. There is no cure for LAM, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

The elevated VEGF-D level is supportive of a diagnosis of LAM. VEGF-D is a growth factor that is produced by smooth muscle cells. In LAM, VEGF-D levels are elevated in the blood and in the lungs. The elevated VEGF-D levels may contribute to the development and progression of LAM.

The patient should undergo further evaluation with a lung biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of LAM. A lung biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of lung tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. A lung biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis of LAM and can help to determine the extent of the disease.

On examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. A malar rash was present (Figure), but there was no rash on the trunk or extremities. She had swelling and tenderness of the MCP and PIP joints and had difficulty making a fist and fully extending her fingers. Laboratory studies revealed a mild normochromic normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, normal white blood cell and platelet counts, and normal results for a comprehensive metabolic panel. She had a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) result (1:160 [homogeneous pattern; negative <1:80 serum dilution]). Testing for rheumatoid factor was negative; levels of inflammatory markers were normal.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and parvovirus B19 infection. SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, and lungs. RA is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that typically affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Parvovirus B19 infection is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, rash, and arthritis.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with SLE. The malar rash is a classic finding in SLE, and the patient's ANA result is positive. However, the patient's rheumatoid factor result is negative, and her inflammatory markers are normal. These findings are not consistent with RA. Parvovirus B19 infection is a possibility, but the patient's history and physical examination are not typical of this infection.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody. CCP antibodies are specific to RA, and their presence is a strong predictor of RA. If the patient's CCP antibody result is positive, the diagnosis of RA is likely. If the patient's CCP antibody result is negative, the diagnosis of SLE is more likely.

**Reasoning:** The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. The characteristic malar rash of SLE is a raised, erythematous rash that typically spares the nasolabial folds. Other common features of SLE include arthralgias, fatigue, fever, and weight loss.

The patient's positive ANA result is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. However, the presence of anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies is highly specific for SLE. Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to order testing for anti-CCP antibodies.

**Answer:** D. Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.
D
api request failed
Reasoning: The patient has a malar rash and polyarthritis, which are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. It can affect any part of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain.

The patient's history of a febrile illness in her family members suggests that she may have been exposed to parvovirus B19, which is a common viral infection that can cause a rash, joint pain, and anemia. Parvovirus B19 can also trigger SLE flares in people who are already at risk for the disease.

The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with SLE. The ANA test is positive in 95% of people with SLE. The rheumatoid factor test is negative in most people with SLE. The anemia is likely due to the inflammation caused by SLE.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody. CCP antibody is a specific antibody that is found in the blood of most people with SLE. Testing for CCP antibody can help to confirm the diagnosis of SLE and to monitor the disease activity.

Title: Palatal Swelling in a Patient With Refractory Leukemia Case is: A man in his 20s presented with rapidly growing, severely painful oral lesions on the left hard palate of 2 months’ duration. His medical history was significant for Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status posttreatment. At the time of evaluation, he had been hospitalized for 5 months with severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. The patient was febrile (38.3°C), with a white blood cell count of 0.5/μL (absolute neutrophil count 0.00; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), hemoglobin levels of 7.6g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), hematocrit 21%, and platelet count 9/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1.0). He was not receiving active cancer treatment. He appeared cachectic and pale. Intraoral examination revealed poor oral hygiene. The left hard palate exhibited a large swelling with a 5×3-cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation (Figure, A). The patient was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse. A biopsy was not recommended owing to medical instability. However, the patient retained a sloughed fragment of the affected tissue, which was submitted for histologic evaluation.

Reasoning:

The patient is a child with multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. The physical examination revealed multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented 1- to 5-mm macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area. There was no history of any systemic disorder and no family history of similar lesions. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide did not reveal hyphae. Wood light examination revealed no accentuation. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation.

The histopathological examination revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis. The clear cells are larger than the neighboring keratinocytes and contain abundant pale cytoplasm.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis. Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis is a common, benign, self-limiting disorder of unknown etiology characterized by the appearance of multiple, small, well-demarcated, hypopigmented macules. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and occur on sun-exposed areas of the skin. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by histopathological examination. There is no specific treatment for idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis, but the lesions often fade spontaneously over time.

Title: Necrotic Plaque on the Distal Nose With Diffuse Crateriform Nodules Case is: A 33-year-old white man presented with a 5-month history of a progressively necrotic plaque on the nose and scattered nodules on the extremities. The plaque first appeared as a small inflammatory papule on the left nostril. Shortly thereafter, the patient was hospitalized at an outside facility for multifocal pneumonia. He was also treated for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of his nose. Despite antibiotic therapy, the papule continued to grow and ulcerate and eventually became necrotic (Figure, A). One month before presentation at our facility, the patient began developing erythematous papules on his arms and legs. The papules enlarged and ulcerated. Some of them healed spontaneously with poxlike scars. He had no recent history of travel. At admission, the patient was tachycardic and febrile to a temperature of 38.5°C. Routine laboratory testing revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin, 7.7 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]). Shave biopsies of necrotic nodules on the left arm and left cheek (Figure, B-D) and, later, an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node were performed. Head computed tomography demonstrated a soft-tissue mass that encased the nasal bone and extended into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. Physical examination revealed a necrotic plaque with surrounding erythema on the distal nose (Figure, A). A 1 × 1-cm crateriform papule with central necrosis was present on the left malar cheek. Multiple nodules with central, dry necrosis and areas of poxlike scarring were scattered across the extremities. Slight contractures of his fingers were also noted.A, Clinical photograph.

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. The patient's initial presentation with a small inflammatory papule on the nose that progressed to a necrotic plaque is characteristic of this disease. The patient also has scattered nodules on the extremities, which are another common finding in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with this diagnosis, as he has normocytic anemia. The patient's head computed tomography and chest computed tomography findings are also consistent with this diagnosis, as they show a soft-tissue mass that encases the nasal bone and extends into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity, as well as bilateral pulmonary nodules.

Title: Chronic Bowel Obstruction in a Middle-aged Man Case is: A man in his 50s of West African descent with a history of prostate cancer treated with robotic prostatectomy 2 years ago presented with 1 year of progressively worsening postprandial nausea or vomiting, epigastric abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss of 27 kg. Four months earlier, he had presented to another hospital and received a diagnosis of adhesive small bowel obstruction, for which he underwent laparotomy and lysis of small adhesive bands that provided only temporary symptomatic improvement. At his current presentation, he was unable to tolerate any oral intake and entirely dependent on total parenteral nutrition. On examination, he was cachectic with a moderately distended, nontender abdomen. The result of a blood test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold; Qiagen) was positive for tuberculosis exposure. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed markedly dilated stomach and duodenum with decompressed, thickened distal small bowel without a clear transition point.Nonoperative management with persistently high nasogastric tube output failed, and the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative findings are shown in Figure 1.Exploratory laparotomy showing the appearance of the small bowel.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a middle-aged man of West African descent with a history of prostate cancer treated with robotic prostatectomy 2 years ago. He presents with 1 year of progressively worsening postprandial nausea or vomiting, epigastric abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss of 27 kg. Four months earlier, he had presented to another hospital and received a diagnosis of adhesive small bowel obstruction, for which he underwent laparotomy and lysis of small adhesive bands that provided only temporary symptomatic improvement. At his current presentation, he is unable to tolerate any oral intake and entirely dependent on total parenteral nutrition. On examination, he is cachectic with a moderately distended, nontender abdomen. The result of a blood test (QuantiFERON-TB Gold; Qiagen) was positive for tuberculosis exposure. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed markedly dilated stomach and duodenum with decompressed, thickened distal small bowel without a clear transition point. Nonoperative management with persistently high nasogastric tube output failed, and the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative findings showed a thickened, matted small bowel with multiple adhesions.

The most likely diagnosis is abdominal tuberculosis. This is supported by the patient's history of prostate cancer, which is a risk factor for tuberculosis, his positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, and the findings on his abdominal computed tomography scan. Adhesive small bowel obstruction is a less likely diagnosis, given the patient's history of prostate cancer and the findings on his abdominal computed tomography scan. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a very unlikely diagnosis, given the patient's lack of a history of cancer other than prostate cancer. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is a rare condition that is most commonly seen in patients with a history of peritoneal dialysis.

Title: Patient With Unexplained Weight Loss, Anorexia, and Back Pain Case is: A 74-year-old man presented to the primary care physician with a 3-month history of weight loss, anorexia, and back pain. His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney stones. His surgical history was significant for a bilateral staged carotid endarterectomy in 1999 and 2000 and an open repair of a 7.4-cm transverse diameter juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a knitted Dacron tube graft (18 mm) in 2014. Ligation of the left renal vein adjacent to the inferior vena cava was performed to gain proximal control of the aorta. The patient underwent extraction of a tooth secondary to an abscess 4 months earlier. Physical examination revealed poor dental hygiene and findings in the lower extremity suggestive of postthrombotic syndrome. The patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute and a leukocyte level of 11 600/cm (normal range, 4000-11 000/cm), with 84% polymorphic neutrophils (normal, <75%); erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 57 mm/h (normal range, 0-10 mm/h), and C-reactive protein level was 15.9 mg/dL (normal, <0.6 mg/dL [to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 9.524]). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed (Figure 1A and B).CT indicates computed tomography; WBC, white blood cell.What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, kidney stones, bilateral staged carotid endarterectomy, and open repair of a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. He presents with a 3-month history of weight loss, anorexia, and back pain. Physical examination reveals poor dental hygiene and findings in the lower extremity suggestive of postthrombotic syndrome. Laboratory tests show an elevated leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis shows a large, irregular mass in the retroperitoneum adjacent to the abdominal aortic graft.

The most likely diagnosis is infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula. This is supported by the patient's history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the presence of a large, irregular mass in the retroperitoneum adjacent to the graft, and the elevated inflammatory markers. Other possible diagnoses include carcinoma of the pancreas, advanced carcinoma of the duodenum, and posterior perforation of a duodenal ulcer. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Title: Rare Complication of Sclerochoroidal Calcifications Case is: A 75-year-old woman of white race/ethnicity was referred for bilateral choroidal lesions. She described her vision as being blurred in the left eye, with areas of her vision being “blocked.” Her review of systems was unremarkable. Her medical and ocular histories were significant for pseudophakia of both eyes, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/64 OS. Intraocular pressure, pupillary reaction, and ocular motility were normal. Confrontation visual fields revealed a deficit in the inferotemporal quadrant of the left eye. External and slitlamp examinations were unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination revealed an epiretinal membrane, as well as extramacular, elevated, hypopigmented, yellow lesions with retinal pigment epithelium changes in both eyes, along with overlying subretinal fluid, subretinal hemorrhage, and exudates in the left eye (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography showed an epiretinal membrane with cystoid macular edema and drusen in both eyes, along with subretinal fluid extending into the left macula, explaining her decreased vision. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated hyperechoic, plaquelike, solid lesions with posterior acoustic shadowing corresponding anatomically to the lesions seen on clinical examination (Figure, B). Fluorescein and indocyanine angiography demonstrated leakage in the area of subretinal hemorrhage in the left eye (Figure, C).A, A yellowish lesion is located in the superonasal quadrant with nasal subretinal hemorrhage (asterisk).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Choroidal metastasis
* Choroidal hemangioma
* Choroidal osteoma
* Choroidal calcification

The patient's history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea is concerning for secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to choroidal calcification. The patient's examination findings are also consistent with choroidal calcification.

The next step in management is to check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels. If these levels are elevated, the patient may need to be treated with parathyroidectomy or other medical therapy to control her hyperparathyroidism.

Title: Progressive Bilateral Cecocentral Scotomata Case is: A 60-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of progressive painless visual loss, photophobia, and color vision impairment in both eyes. The symptoms started in the right eye and progressed to the left eye 4 months later. His medical history included hypothyroidism and meningioma of the cervical spine. There was no history of trauma or surgery in the previous year. The patient had been evaluated elsewhere for suspected autoimmune retinopathy, with normal results for serum antibodies against recoverin and enolase, a complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibody, extractable nuclear antigens, and serologies for syphilis and Lyme disease. A previous neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, had been unrevealing.His best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/400 OD and 20/100 OS. The results of a kinetic perimetry with a Goldmann perimeter demonstrated dense bilateral cecocentral scotomata. There was no afferent pupillary defect in either eye. A fundus examination showed trace temporal optic disc pallor in the right eye and a normal-appearing optic disc in the left eye (Figure 1A). Full-field electroretinography results were normal, but multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) showed reduced wave amplitudes nasal to the fovea in each eye (Figure 1B). Fundus autofluorescence and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the macula and optic nerve showed no abnormalities.A, Fundus photography shows a normal-appearing optic disc of the left eye.

The patient has a 6-month history of progressive painless visual loss, photophobia, and color vision impairment in both eyes. The symptoms started in the right eye and progressed to the left eye 4 months later. His medical history includes hypothyroidism and meningioma of the cervical spine. There was no history of trauma or surgery in the previous year. The patient had been evaluated elsewhere for suspected autoimmune retinopathy, with normal results for serum antibodies against recoverin and enolase, a complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibody, extractable nuclear antigens, and serologies for syphilis and Lyme disease. A previous neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, had been unrevealing.

His best-corrected visual acuity measured 20/400 OD and 20/100 OS. The results of a kinetic perimetry with a Goldmann perimeter demonstrated dense bilateral cecocentral scotomata. There was no afferent pupillary defect in either eye. A fundus examination showed trace temporal optic disc pallor in the right eye and a normal-appearing optic disc in the left eye (Figure 1A).

A, Fundus photography shows a normal-appearing optic disc of the left eye. B, Multifocal electroretinography demonstrates reduced amplitudes of waveforms nasal to the fovea of the left eye. In the papillomacular region, the amplitudes are reduced by approximately 50% compared with the normal amplitudes in the temporal region.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's visual loss includes autoimmune retinopathy, toxic retinopathy, nutritional deficiency, and mitochondrial disease. Autoimmune retinopathy is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation and damage to the retina. Toxic retinopathy can be caused by exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, or heavy metals. Nutritional deficiency can cause retinal damage, particularly if the deficiency is of vitamin A or B12. Mitochondrial disease is a group of disorders caused by defects in the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing organelles in cells.

The patient's history and examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. The patient's progressive painless visual loss, photophobia, and color vision impairment are typical of mitochondrial disease. The patient's medical history of hypothyroidism and meningioma of the cervical spine is also consistent with mitochondrial disease, as these conditions are associated with an increased risk of mitochondrial disease. The patient's previous evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, was unrevealing, which is also consistent with mitochondrial disease.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to order mitochondrial genetic testing. Mitochondrial genetic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose mitochondrial disease. If the patient has a positive result for mitochondrial genetic testing, then the patient should be referred to a mitochondrial disease specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

Title: Night Blindness, Ring Scotoma, and a Nonrecordable Electroretinogram in an Elderly Woman Case is: A woman in her 70s and of Korean descent reported difficulty seeing in dimly lit settings for the past 6 years and was referred for evaluation. Her medical history was remarkable for long-standing hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Slitlamp examination showed prominent nuclear sclerosis and a posterior subcapsular cataract in the right eye and a well-positioned intraocular lens in the left eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed bilateral pigment mottling with extensive peripheral depigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, sparing the central fovea bilaterally. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed complete loss of photoreceptors outside the fovea, with retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, irregular proliferation, and some remodeling (Figure, A). Fundus autofluorescence showed a ring of parafoveal hypofluorescence and hyperfluorescence, with speckled hypofluorescence peripherally (Figure, B). Goldmann perimetry of both eyes (Figure, C) revealed significant constriction of the V-4-e isopter with an extensive ring scotoma between approximately 10° and 30° eccentricity. Central vision with the I-4-e isopter was constricted to 5° to 7°. A multifocal electroretinogram (ERG) showed profound signal attenuation throughout the examined area.

Title: A 2-Year History of Diplopia, Optic Disc Edema, and Amaurosis Case is: A right-handed man in his 50s with a medical history of hypertension was referred for optic disc edema in the right eye and double vision. He was initially seen locally for new-onset double vision in upgaze without other visual symptoms. The patient had a 3–prism diopter left hypertropia in upgaze with full motility and was incidentally found to have optic disc edema in the right eye. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OU. Automated visual fields were normal, and there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no apparent abnormalities (Figure 1A). During the subsequent 6 months, the patient experienced graying of vision on rightward gaze. Results of an evaluation again demonstrated normal visual acuity and visual fields. Results of a local workup were negative, including acetylcholine receptor antibody. The patient presented to our clinic 2 years after initial symptom onset with continued graying of vision on eccentric gaze. His best-corrected visual acuity on examination was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the right eye. There was prominent chronic-appearing optic disc edema in the right eye without abnormalities in the left eye (Figure 1B).

Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which can cause optic disc edema, visual loss, and color vision defects. The most common cause of optic neuritis is multiple sclerosis (MS), but it can also be caused by other inflammatory diseases, such as sarcoidosis or Lyme disease.

The patient's MRI scan 2 years prior to presentation showed trace enhancement at the orbital apex, which could be a sign of MS. However, the patient's current MRI scan does not show any abnormalities. This suggests that the patient's optic neuritis is not due to MS.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS, which is within normal limits. However, the patient has a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. This suggests that the patient has optic nerve dysfunction in the right eye.

The patient's visual field testing showed superior greater than inferior peripheral field loss in the right eye. This is a characteristic finding of optic neuritis.

The patient's best-course of management is to initiate corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that can help to reduce inflammation and improve visual function in patients with optic neuritis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a middle-aged man with bilateral subretinal fluid. The most likely diagnosis is central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR). CSR is a self-limiting condition that typically resolves within 6-12 months. However, in some cases, CSR can recur or progress to more serious retinal problems.

The first step in the management of CSR is to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that could be causing the retinal detachment. These conditions include syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis. If these conditions are ruled out, then the patient can be managed conservatively with observation.

If the subretinal fluid persists for 3 months or more, then the patient may be offered photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that uses a laser to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This can help to reduce the amount of subretinal fluid and improve vision.

**Answer:**

The correct answer is **D.** Observe the patient; offer photodynamic therapy if the subretinal fluid persists for 3 months.

In this case, the patient has only had bilateral subretinal fluid for 2 weeks. It is too early to know if the condition will resolve on its own or if it will require treatment. Therefore, the best option is to observe the patient and offer photodynamic therapy if the subretinal fluid persists for 3 months or more.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient is a middle-aged man with bilateral subretinal fluid. He has a history of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) in the left eye, which is a condition that causes a fluid buildup in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. CSR is usually a self-limiting condition, but it can sometimes lead to permanent vision loss.

The patient's current symptoms, including bilateral subretinal fluid and acute worsening of visual acuity, are concerning for a more serious condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. MS can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision, and optic neuritis.

In order to rule out MS, the patient should undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to detect abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. If the MRI is normal, the patient's symptoms are more likely to be due to CSR. However, if the MRI shows abnormalities consistent with MS, the patient will need to be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion first noticed 3 months earlier as a pimple. The lesion is itchy but without generalized pruritus. The patient reports a weight loss of 10 pounds over the preceding 3 months. In addition, he reports a longer history of vague, nonspecific, intermittent abdominal pain without nausea, vomiting, or fever starting about 3 years prior to presentation. Previous work-up had revealed minimal abdominal adenopathy, but the patient declined further workup. On examination, he has no other cutaneous lesions, but he does have cervical lymphadenopathy. All other physical findings are within normal limits. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, save for a mild normochromic normocytic anemia and a mildly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase. A biopsy specimen from the skin lesion shows a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes in the dermis.

The most likely diagnosis is mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with a slowly enlarging patch or plaque on the skin. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with generalized pruritus. Weight loss is a common feature of mycosis fungoides, particularly in advanced disease. Abdominal pain is not a typical feature of mycosis fungoides, but it may occur in patients with advanced disease. Cervical lymphadenopathy is a common finding in mycosis fungoides, particularly in advanced disease.

The other possible diagnoses are follicular lymphoma, lichen planus, and marginal zone lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a type of B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that typically presents with flat-topped, violaceous papules on the skin. Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is mycosis fungoides.

Title: A 71-Year-Old Man With Inferior ST-Segment Elevation Case is: A 71-year-old man presented with a 3-hour history of central chest pain associated with breathlessness. His medical history was significant for remote percutaneous coronary intervention 19 years ago, with no available details at the time of the patient’s presentation. On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically unstable, with a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg. He was tachycardiac, with a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, and his oxygen saturation level was 91% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination showed no jugular vein distension or peripheral edema, the presence of bibasilar rales, and no cardiac murmurs. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed inferior ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The patient was transferred urgently to the cardiac catheter laboratory. Coronary angiography was undertaken via the right radial artery, and both left and right coronary arteries were selectively engaged (Figure 1 and Videos 1 and 2).Selective left (A) and right (B) coronary angiography.Perform coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending arteryDetermine severity of the left anterior descending artery plaque by measuring fractional flow reservePursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identifiedWhat Would You Do Next?

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of remote percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who presents with a 3-hour history of central chest pain associated with breathlessness. On arrival, he is hemodynamically unstable, with a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, tachycardia, and oxygen desaturation. A 12-lead electrocardiogram shows inferior ST-segment elevation. Coronary angiography shows a significant stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The next step in management is to perform coronary intervention with stenting of the LAD artery. This will restore blood flow to the myocardium and improve the patient's hemodynamic status. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a measure of the severity of a stenosis and is not necessary in this case, as the stenosis is clearly significant. Pursuing the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified is not necessary, as the LAD artery is the culprit artery in this case. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is already established with coronary angiography.

Reasoning:
The patient has a significant stenosis of the LAD artery, which is causing his symptoms. Coronary intervention with stenting of the LAD artery will restore blood flow to the myocardium and improve his hemodynamic status. FFR is a measure of the severity of a stenosis and is not necessary in this case, as the stenosis is clearly significant. Pursuing the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified is not necessary, as the LAD artery is the culprit artery in this case. CTA is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is already established with coronary angiography.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of remote percutaneous coronary intervention who presents with central chest pain and breathlessness. He is hemodynamically unstable, with a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg and a heart rate of 105 beats per minute. He has inferior ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram. The patient should be treated urgently with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

Answer:
A. Perform coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery.

The patient has an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the LAD. PCI is the standard of care for STEMI, and it is associated with improved outcomes compared to medical therapy alone. PCI involves the insertion of a balloon catheter into the narrowed coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. A stent, a small metal mesh tube, may be placed in the artery to keep it open.

In this case, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, which is a high-risk situation for STEMI. PCI should be performed as soon as possible to restore blood flow to the LAD and prevent further damage to the heart muscle.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Determining the severity of the LAD plaque by measuring fractional flow reserve is not necessary in the acute setting. Pursuing the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified is not necessary because the LAD is the culprit artery in this case. Order urgent computed tomography angiography is not necessary because the diagnosis of STEMI is already made on the basis of the patient's history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of remote percutaneous coronary intervention who presents with inferior ST-segment elevation. On arrival, he is hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg and a heart rate of 105 beats per minute. The electrocardiogram shows inferior ST-segment elevation.

The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. The goal of treatment in this setting is to restore blood flow to the myocardium as quickly as possible. This can be achieved with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which involves inserting a balloon into the coronary artery and inflating it to open the blockage. In some cases, a stent may be placed in the artery to keep it open.

In this case, the patient should be taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory immediately for PCI. There is no need to determine the severity of the left anterior descending artery plaque or to pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be useful in the future to assess the patient's overall cardiovascular risk, but it is not necessary in the acute setting.

Title: A Patient With an Elevated α-Fetoprotein Level and Liver Masses Case is: A 55-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with several weeks of malaise and a 6.8-kg weight loss associated with poor appetite. He reported no fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a thin habitus; no palmar erythema, spider angiomas, or gynecomastia were observed. Laboratory tests showed normal complete blood cell count and chemistry panel findings. Hepatic panel showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (209 U/L; upper limit of normal [ULN], 150 U/L [3.49 μkat/L; ULN, 2.5 μkat/L]), normal total bilirubin level (0.4 mg/dL [6.84 μmol/L]), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (41 U/L; ULN, 35 U/L [0.68 μkat/L; ULN, 0.58 μkat/L]), and normal aspartate aminotransferase level (27 U/L [0.45 μkat/L]). A single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, intussusception of the small bowel, and normal liver contour with no signs of portal hypertension (Figure 1, left). α-Fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated (1252 ng/mL; ULN, 9 ng/mL); levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (<2 U/mL) and carcinoembryonic antigen (2.8 ng/mL) were normal. A triple-phase CT scan was obtained to further evaluate the small bowel, which revealed no small bowel abnormalities but instead demonstrated a 3.3 × 2.8-cm heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic tail mass not seen on the previous single-phase CT (Figure 1, right).Left, Axial view from single-phase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealing bilobar liver masses.

Title: Aggressive-Appearing Intratracheal Mass in an Older Woman Case is: A woman in her early 70s presented to her local emergency department with the recent onset of wheezing and dyspnea. Noncontrast computed tomography of her chest showed a 1.1-cm nodular lesion in the upper trachea that appeared to be originating from the right lobe of the thyroid (Figure 1A). She was referred to our center for evaluation and management of what appeared to be an aggressive thyroid malignant neoplasm. She presented with obvious biphasic stridor and a report of dyspnea on mild exertion. A CT of the chest showed a soft-tissue mass protruding into the trachea in the posterolateral aspect of the right side of the tracheal region that appeared to be contiguous with the thyroid gland. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid was performed; however, there was no nodule in the right thyroid lobe that correlated with the CT findings. The left thyroid lobe contained an 8-mm nodule. Examination of a biopsy specimen from this nodule showed medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The patient’s serum calcitonin level was 23 pg/mL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck revealed a hyperintense tracheal mass on T2-weighted imaging (Figure 1B) that showed enhancement on administration of contrast medium (not shown). In addition, a 0.3-cm nonenhancing nodule at the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe, separate from the tracheal mass, was identified. Vocal cord mobility was normal on fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and the patient verbally denied having dysphagia. Both ultrasonography and CT/magnetic resonance imaging failed to identify any suspicious adenopathy.A, Axial computed tomogram (CT) of the chest without contrast medium shows a 1.1-cm hypodense, exophytic right posterolateral intratracheal mass with apparent continuity with the right thyroid lobe. B, Axial, T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) with contrast medium revealed a hyperintense soft-tissue mass within the tracheal lumen. A T1-weighted image before the addition of contrast medium (not shown) showed a slightly hyperintense mass to the thyroid gland. That lesion showed enhancement on administration of contrast medium.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Aggressive invasive thyroid cancer , B: Amyloidosis , C: Benign thyroid rest , D: Mucoid pseudotumor.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her early 70s who presented to her local emergency department with the recent onset of wheezing and dyspnea. Noncontrast computed tomography of her chest showed a 1.1-cm nodular lesion in the upper trachea that appeared to be originating from the right lobe of the thyroid. She was referred to our center for evaluation and management of what appeared to be an aggressive thyroid malignant neoplasm.

The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). MTC is a rare, aggressive form of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. C cells produce calcitonin, a hormone that helps to regulate blood calcium levels. MTC is often associated with other endocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytoma and parathyroid adenoma, as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2 syndromes.

The patient's serum calcitonin level was elevated, which is a common finding in MTC. The CT scan showed a soft-tissue mass protruding into the trachea in the posterolateral aspect of the right side of the tracheal region that appeared to be contiguous with the thyroid gland. This finding is also consistent with MTC.

The patient underwent ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid, which showed medullary thyroid cancer. This finding confirms the diagnosis of MTC.

The patient's prognosis is poor. MTC is a very aggressive cancer with a high rate of recurrence and metastasis. The average survival time for patients with MTC is 5-10 years.

The correct answer is A: Aggressive invasive thyroid cancer.

Sinonasal mucosal biopsy results demonstrate numerous multinucleated giant cells (black arrowheads), necrosis (white arrowhead), and inflammatory cells invading vessel walls (blue arrowhead). Hematoxylin-eosin stain (original magnification ×10).

The most likely diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a systemic vasculitis that can affect the sinonasal mucosa. GPA is characterized by inflammation of the small and medium-sized arteries, leading to necrosis and destruction of the surrounding tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy, which shows granulomatous inflammation with giant cells.

The treatment for GPA is corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove diseased tissue or relieve pressure on vital structures.

The prognosis for patients with GPA is variable, depending on the extent of disease involvement. With treatment, most patients can achieve remission and have a good quality of life.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 32-year-old Hispanic man with a 6-week history of nasal pain and swelling. He has been treated with antibiotics without improvement. The swelling has worsened and extended to his upper lip. He has developed difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage. On presentation, he is afebrile without leukocytosis. Physical examination demonstrates diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extends to above his upper lip. Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrate marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. No significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows was noted.

No intracranial or intraorbital disease extension was noted.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis
* Squamous cell carcinoma
* Necrotizing fasciitis

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the nose, sinuses, and ears. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas, which are collections of inflammatory cells, in the affected tissues. The patient's history of nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks, is consistent with this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extends to above his upper lip are also consistent with Wegener granulomatosis. The CT findings of marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema are also consistent with this diagnosis. The MRI findings of soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images are also consistent with Wegener granulomatosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the nose. It is characterized by the presence of a raised, red, or ulcerated lesion on the skin. The patient's history of nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks, is not consistent with this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extends to above his upper lip are not consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The CT findings of marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema are not consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The MRI findings of soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images are not consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection of the skin and soft tissues that can lead to death. It is characterized by the presence of rapidly spreading, necrotic tissue. The patient's history of nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks, is not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis. The physical examination findings of diffuse swelling and tenderness of the nose with honey-colored crusting that extends to above his upper lip are not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis. The CT findings of marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema are not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis. The MRI findings of soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images are not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis.

In conclusion, the patient's most likely diagnosis is Wegener granulomatosis.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. CLL is typically a slow-growing cancer, but it can sometimes progress to a more aggressive form. One of the complications of CLL is autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells. This can lead to anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues.
The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, conjunctival pallor, and scleral icterus are consistent with anemia. The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL, a hematocrit of 24%, and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 85 fL. These results are consistent with anemia. The patient's direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is positive, which indicates that there are antibodies attached to the patient's red blood cells. This is a characteristic finding in autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Answer:
The patient has warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient's presentation is consistent with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). She has a history of CLL, which is a known risk factor for AIHA.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of asthma and elective cesarean delivery 11 days prior who presents to the emergency department with 3 days of exertional chest pain. The pain is described as crushing and substernal, but she denied radiation or associated dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.

An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with diffuse ST-segment depressions but without q waves or ST-segment elevation. Computed tomography angiography did not show pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 53%, with apical akinesis and no valvular disease.

The patient was started on aspirin and ticagrelor, heparin infusion, and metoprolol tartrate for treatment of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. She underwent coronary angiography, which showed a 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The next step in management is to determine whether the patient should undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon catheter into the narrowed artery and inflating it to widen the artery. CABG is a surgical procedure that involves bypassing the narrowed artery with a graft from another blood vessel.

The decision of whether to undergo PCI or CABG is based on a number of factors, including the patient's age, overall health, and the severity of the stenosis. In general, PCI is preferred for younger patients with less severe disease, while CABG is preferred for older patients with more severe disease.

In this case, the patient is a young woman with a relatively mild stenosis. Therefore, PCI is the preferred treatment option.

Title: Serum Creatinine in the Critically Ill Patient With Sepsis Case is: A 73-year-old man underwent esophageal resection for cancer. He had a history of hypertension that was treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker. Preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 98 mL/min/1.73 m2. On the second postoperative day, body temperature was 38.6°C. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral lung consolidations consistent with pneumonia. Blood pressure decreased from 145/72 mm Hg to 96/53 mm Hg with a heart rate of 105/min. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation. In the ICU, urine output was 50 mL over 3 hours. On day 3, he received 4.5 L of Ringer lactate over 12 hours. Laboratory values are shown in the Table.The change in serum creatinine is within the coefficient of variation.The patient has acute kidney injury most likely related to sepsis.There are insufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred.How Do You Interpret the Test Results From Day 3 Postoperatively at 3 am? A: The change in serum creatinine is within the coefficient of variation. , B: The patient has acute kidney injury most likely related to sepsis. , C: The patient has prerenal azotemia. , D: There are insufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient's serum creatinine increased from 0.9 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL, which is a change of 33%. The coefficient of variation for serum creatinine is 10%, so the change in serum creatinine is outside the normal range. This suggests that the patient has acute kidney injury.

Acute kidney injury is defined as a sudden decrease in kidney function that results in an increase in serum creatinine. It can be caused by a number of factors, including sepsis, prerenal azotemia, and acute tubular necrosis.

Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that is caused by a bacterial infection. It can lead to acute kidney injury by causing a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys.

Prerenal azotemia is a condition in which the kidneys are not receiving enough blood flow. It can be caused by dehydration, heart failure, and liver disease.

Acute tubular necrosis is a condition in which the tubules of the kidneys are damaged. It can be caused by a number of factors, including sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, and shock.

In the case of this patient, the most likely cause of acute kidney injury is sepsis. The patient has a number of risk factors for sepsis, including a history of cancer, surgery, and mechanical ventilation. The patient's clinical presentation is also consistent with sepsis, including fever, hypotension, and oliguria.

**Answer:**

B. The patient has acute kidney injury most likely related to sepsis.

Title: Violaceous Patches in the Axilla Case is: A man in his 40s presented with a 3-month history of discrete, dark red, circular lesions in his right axilla. He endorsed severe pruritus at these sites that would wake him up at night. He denied any recent trauma or history of similar lesions. He denied associated pain, blisters, or systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills). His medical history was unremarkable, and he noted no environmental triggers or new medications. Treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, ketoconazole cream, and discontinuation of underarm deodorant yielded no improvement. Physical examination revealed 3 well-circumscribed, violaceous, annular patches without scale or erosion that are limited to his right axilla (Figure, A).

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 40s who presents with a 3-month history of discrete, dark red, circular lesions in his right axilla. He endorses severe pruritus at these sites that would wake him up at night. He denied any recent trauma or history of similar lesions. He denied associated pain, blisters, or systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills). His medical history is unremarkable, and he noted no environmental triggers or new medications. Treatment with over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, ketoconazole cream, and discontinuation of underarm deodorant yielded no improvement. Physical examination revealed 3 well-circumscribed, violaceous, annular patches without scale or erosion that are limited to his right axilla (Figure, A). No other lesions were noted on his skin or mucous membranes. A Wood lamp examination was negative. A punch biopsy specimen from a lesion was obtained (Figure, B and C).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease), inverse lichen planus, fixed drug eruption, and erythrasma.

Familial benign pemphigus is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. The lesions are typically small, flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving behind erosions and crusts. The disease is most commonly seen in adults, and there is no cure. Treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications.

Inverse lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules or plaques. The lesions are typically found in intertriginous areas, such as the groin, underarms, and under the breasts. Inverse lichen planus is often associated with severe pruritus. Treatment is typically with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

Fixed drug eruption is a type of allergic reaction that occurs in response to a specific medication. The lesions are typically well-circumscribed, erythematous plaques that develop at the site of drug application. The lesions can be pruritic, painful, or both. Treatment is aimed at identifying and discontinuing the offending medication.

Erythrasma is a superficial fungal infection of the skin that is typically seen in warm, moist areas, such as the groin, underarms, and toe webs. The lesions are typically well-circumscribed, erythematous patches with a characteristic "collarette" of scale. Treatment is with topical antifungal medications.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of inverse lichen planus. The patient's lesions are well-circumscribed, violaceous, and annular, and they are limited to the right axilla. The biopsy findings show a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. These findings are classic for inverse lichen planus.

Title: A White Patch on the Tongue Case is: An 80-year-old white woman presented with an asymptomatic white patch affecting the tongue of 1 month’s duration. She had a 15-year history of oral lichen planus (OLP) managed with betamethasone dipropionate, 0.05%, gel twice daily and clotrimazole troches, 10 mg, 3 times daily as needed for symptomatic OLP flares. Medical history revealed stage 1A mycosis fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affecting the right calf and left thigh managed primarily with halobetasol, 0.05%, cream owing to intolerance of narrowband UV-B therapy and mechlorethamine, 0.016%, gel. Immunosuppression or history of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), was not reported. A 1.5 × 1.0-cm nonremovable white, plaquelike lesion was observed on the left lateral tongue (Figure 1A). Biopsy specimens were obtained with a 3-mm punch instrument at 3 different sites, which demonstrated similar microscopic findings (Figure 1B and C).A, A corrugated, nonremovable white lesion on left lateral tongue.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a 15-year history of oral lichen planus (OLP) managed with betamethasone dipropionate, 0.05%, gel twice daily and clotrimazole troches, 10 mg, 3 times daily as needed for symptomatic OLP flares. She also has a history of stage 1A mycosis fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affecting the right calf and left thigh managed primarily with halobetasol, 0.05%, cream owing to intolerance of narrowband UV-B therapy and mechlorethamine, 0.016%, gel. She has no history of immunosuppression or infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The patient presents with an asymptomatic white patch affecting the tongue of 1 month’s duration. The lesion is nonremovable and is located on the left lateral tongue. Biopsy specimens were obtained with a 3-mm punch instrument at 3 different sites, which demonstrated similar microscopic findings.

The most likely diagnosis is oral lichen planus. Oral lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa that can affect any part of the mouth, including the tongue. It is characterized by white, lacy or reticular lesions that can be painful or pruritic. The lesions are often described as having a "cigarette paper" or "Wickham's striae" appearance.

The diagnosis of oral lichen planus is made clinically, based on the patient's history and the appearance of the lesions. Biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions, such as oral cancer.

There is no cure for oral lichen planus, but the symptoms can be managed with treatment. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral steroids, and other medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions.

Title: A Case of Pigmented Longitudinal Melanonychia Case is: A man in his 40s presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a new pigmented lesion on his left second toenail. The lesion first appeared 12 months before presentation and was progressively growing. This was his first time presenting to a physician for this problem, and no prior treatments had been attempted. The lesion was asymptomatic. He was otherwise well and denied any fevers or weight loss.Clinical examination revealed a dark brown longitudinal pigment band covering the full length of the toenail of the left second digit with corresponding nail thickening over the pigmented band. The pigment was the same width throughout the band and extended to the proximal nail fold (Figure, A). No other nail or skin lesions were found at the time of examination. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the nail plate and nail matrix and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B-D).A dark brown longitudinal pigment band on the second toenail with pigment extends to the proximal nail fold (A). Histopathologic examination of the specimen with hematoxylin-eosin stain is seen at original magnification of ×40 (B), ×100 (C), and ×200 (D).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Pigmented onychomatricoma , B: Subungual melanoma , C: Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ , D: Pigmented onychopapilloma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is a man in his 40s with a dark brown longitudinal pigment band on the second toenail. The lesion first appeared 12 months before presentation and has been progressively growing. It is asymptomatic and there are no other nail or skin lesions. The clinical examination reveals a dark brown longitudinal pigment band covering the full length of the toenail of the left second digit with corresponding nail thickening over the pigmented band. The pigment is the same width throughout the band and extends to the proximal nail fold. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the nail plate and nail matrix and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of melanocytes in the nail matrix with extension into the nail bed. There is no evidence of atypia or invasion.

Answer: The most likely diagnosis is pigmented onychomatricoma. Pigmented onychomatricoma is a benign neoplasm of the nail matrix that is characterized by a proliferation of melanocytes. It is the most common cause of longitudinal melanonychia in adults. The clinical presentation is typically a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate. The lesion is usually asymptomatic and there is no evidence of nail dystrophy. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Histologically, pigmented onychomatricoma shows a proliferation of melanocytes in the nail matrix with extension into the nail bed. There is no evidence of atypia or invasion.

The differential diagnosis of longitudinal melanonychia includes subungual melanoma, pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and pigmented onychopapilloma. Subungual melanoma is a malignant neoplasm of the nail matrix. It is the most common type of melanoma in the nail unit. The clinical presentation is typically a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate. The lesion is usually asymmetric and irregular in shape. There may be associated nail dystrophy, such as pitting or crumbling. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Histologically, subungual melanoma shows a proliferation of melanocytes in the nail matrix with invasion into the nail bed and underlying bone. Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precancerous lesion of the nail unit. The clinical presentation is typically a dark brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate. The lesion is usually symmetric and regular in shape. There is no associated nail dystrophy. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Histologically, pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ shows a proliferation of melanocytes in the nail matrix without invasion into the nail bed or underlying bone. Pigmented onychopapilloma is a benign neoplasm of the nail bed. The clinical presentation is typically a dark brown or black papule on the nail bed. The lesion is usually solitary and asymptomatic. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Histologically, pigmented onychopapilloma shows a proliferation of melanocytes in the nail bed without invasion into the underlying bone.

In the present case, the patient is a man in his 40s with a dark brown longitudinal pigment band on the second toenail. The lesion first appeared 12 months before presentation and has been progressively growing. It is asymptomatic and there are no other nail or skin lesions. The clinical examination reveals a dark brown longitudinal pigment band covering the full length of the toenail of the left second digit with corresponding nail thickening over the pigmented band. The pigment is the same width throughout the band and extends to the proximal nail fold. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the nail plate and nail matrix and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of melanocytes in the nail matrix with extension into the nail bed. There is no evidence of atypia or invasion.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is pigmented onychomatricoma. The clinical presentation is typical of pigmented onychomatricoma and the histopathologic findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Subungual melanoma is a possibility, but the clinical presentation is not typical and the histopathologic findings do not show invasion into the nail bed or underlying bone. Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ is also a possibility, but the clinical presentation is not typical and the histopathologic findings do not show invasion into the nail bed or underlying bone. Pigmented onychopapilloma is not a possibility, as the lesion is not a papule and there is no evidence of invasion into the underlying bone.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is pigmented onychomatricoma.

He also reported a vague feeling of perplexity and derealization. These experiences began when he started college and continued to occur every day for up to an hour at a time, causing significant distress. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM did not reveal any mental disorder.

Based on the information provided, the patient does not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of the psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, or schizoaffective disorder). He does not have any formal thought disorders, such as delusions or hallucinations. His symptoms are mild and do not appear to be significantly impairing his functioning. He is able to question his beliefs about people looking and talking about him, and he does not believe that these individuals mean him harm. He has never acted on these thoughts. He also reports a vague feeling of perplexity and derealization, but these experiences are not severe and do not appear to be causing significant distress.

Given the patient's age, lack of family history of mental disorders, and mild symptoms, it is likely that his problems are due to adjustment difficulties related to starting college. It is important to remember that adjustment difficulties are common in young adults, and they usually resolve on their own over time. In this case, it would be appropriate to provide the patient with supportive counseling and psychoeducation about adjustment difficulties. It would also be helpful to connect him with resources on campus, such as the counseling center or the student health center, so that he can get the support he needs.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed increased thickness in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (Figure 1).

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). ARSACS is a rare, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive spastic ataxia, dysarthria, and optic atrophy. The disease is caused by mutations in the SACS gene, which encodes a protein called sacsin. Sacsin is thought to play a role in the maintenance of the integrity of axons, and mutations in the SACS gene lead to the degeneration of axons in the central nervous system.

The diagnosis of ARSACS is made based on the clinical presentation, family history, and genetic testing. There is no cure for ARSACS, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment options include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and medications to improve balance and coordination.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of multilevel cervical and lumbar fusion surgical procedures using anterior, left lateral, and posterior approaches over a 10-year period. She subsequently noted a new, slowly enlarging bulge in her left midback that was bothersome with activities of daily living. She denied pain directly overlying the area and was otherwise tolerating a regular diet and having usual bowel function. Physical examination revealed a soft bulge in the lateral left midback. There were no apparent associated skin changes, and the palpable mass appeared fixed and nonreducible. The mass was most apparent with upright posture and was accentuated with a cough impulse, but it was less distinct when examined in the prone position. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which showed a soft tissue mass in the left retroperitoneum that was consistent with a lipoma.

The most likely diagnosis is a left lateral lumbar lipoma. A lipoma is a benign tumor of adipose tissue. It is the most common type of soft tissue tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all soft tissue tumors. Lipomas are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, discomfort, or cosmetic deformity. They are most commonly found in the trunk and extremities, but they can also occur in the head and neck.

The diagnosis of a lipoma is usually made based on the history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and determining the size and location of the tumor. Treatment of a lipoma is usually not necessary, but surgical removal may be indicated for cosmetic or symptomatic reasons.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a 3-week history of worsening neck and shoulder pain. He has no history of recent trauma. He admits to paresthesia and pain radiating down his right arm but denies any weakness. He has no difficulty with speech or swallowing. He has no medical comorbidities or prior surgery. On examination, he is noted to have some cervical midline spine tenderness. No weakness or sensory deficits are identified. No palpable lymphadenopathy, swelling, or mass is noted. A plain radiograph of the neck demonstrates tracheal deviation, and he then underwent computed tomography of the chest (Figure 1A) and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine (Figure 1B).

The computed tomography scan of the chest shows a large mass in the right lower lobe of the lung. The magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine shows a compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic lung cancer. The patient's history of worsening neck and shoulder pain, paresthesia and pain radiating down his right arm, and tracheal deviation are all consistent with a metastatic lesion involving the spine. The computed tomography scan of the chest shows a large mass in the right lower lobe of the lung, which is the most common site of metastasis for lung cancer. The magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine shows a compression fracture of the T12 vertebral body, which is a common complication of metastatic disease.

Title: Rapid Vision Loss in a Young Woman Case is: An otherwise healthy woman in her 30s presented to an outside health care professional with a 2-day history of floaters in her left eye. She denied additional ocular symptoms and reported no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, her symptoms had worsened, and she was referred for consultation.Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses were normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants (Figure 1A and B). Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions (Figure 1C).A, Color fundus photography montage of the left eye shows hyperemic disc with blurred margins, vascular sheathing, and peripheral retinal whitening. B, Magnified image of the temporal retina shows well-demarcated infiltrates with scalloped margins and adjacent intraretinal hemorrhages. C, Montage from 4 days later shows convergence of necrotic lesions in a circumferential pattern around the equator with confluence in the anterior periphery. Fresh laser barricade spots are seen at the posterior margin of the areas of necrosis.Order a hypercoagulable workup and start a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg dailyObtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agentsObtain a vitreous sample for culture and inject vancomycin and ceftazidimeWhat Would You Do Next? A: Inject an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent , B: Order a hypercoagulable workup and start a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg daily , C: Obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agents , D: Obtain a vitreous sample for culture and inject vancomycin and ceftazidime. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of posterior uveitis. Posterior uveitis is an inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye, which includes the retina, choroid, and vitreous. The most common causes of posterior uveitis are infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders. In this case, the patient's history of floaters and the presence of vitritis, macular striae, and vascular sheathing are all suggestive of an infectious cause. The most common infectious causes of posterior uveitis are viruses, bacteria, and fungi. In this case, the patient's age, lack of relevant medical history, and absence of systemic symptoms are all suggestive of a viral cause. The most common viral causes of posterior uveitis are herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Answer: C. Obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agents.

The most definitive way to diagnose a viral cause of posterior uveitis is to obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect the presence of viral DNA in the aqueous humor. If the PCR test is positive, the patient should be treated with antiviral agents. The most common antiviral agents used to treat posterior uveitis caused by herpes simplex virus are acyclovir and valacyclovir. The most common antiviral agents used to treat posterior uveitis caused by varicella zoster virus are acyclovir and valacyclovir. The most common antiviral agents used to treat posterior uveitis caused by cytomegalovirus are ganciclovir and foscarnet.

A hypercoagulable workup is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any risk factors for a hypercoagulable disorder. Obtaining a vitreous sample for culture is not necessary in this case because the patient's presentation is consistent with a viral cause of posterior uveitis. Injecting an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any evidence of neovascularization.

Title: Recurrent Bilateral Periorbital Swelling Case is: A 47-year old woman with a history of adult-onset asthma and waxing and waning bilateral swelling of the upper eyelids presented with greater swelling of the left than right upper eyelids with yellow lesions (Figure 1A). Previous episodes had been treated successfully with oral prednisone, and the patient had numerous recurrences within the past 10 years. According to the patient’s report, a biopsy was performed several years ago at an outside institution, and the diagnosis was xanthelasma. She denied visual changes.A, External photograph demonstrating bilateral periorbital swelling greater in the left than right eyelids, with associated yellow lesions. B, Axial computed tomographic scan with contrast demonstrating enlargement and homogeneous enhancement of the left lacrimal gland and left lateral rectus muscle and bilateral preseptal soft tissues.Visual acuity was 20/40 OU  and improved to 20/25 OU with pinhole testing. Intraocular pressures were normal, extraocular motility was full, and the pupils were round and reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. Results of the examination revealed yellow lesions on both eyelids, palpebral swelling greater in the left than the right eye, erythema, ptosis, an S-shaped deformity of the left upper eyelid, and a palpable mass of the left superolateral orbit (Figure 1A). Hertel exophthalmometry showed 2 mm of relative proptosis in the left eye. Results of slitlamp and dilated fundus examinations were unremarkable. A computed tomographic scan showed preseptal soft tissue swelling in both eyes and an extraconal left lacrimal gland mass extending behind the globe (Figure 1B). We contacted the outside institution, and no reports of histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen were found.What Would You Do Next? A: Oral antibiotic treatment , B: Surgical debulking , C: Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy , D: Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of adult-onset asthma and waxing and waning bilateral swelling of the upper eyelids. Previous episodes had been treated successfully with oral prednisone, and the patient had numerous recurrences within the past 10 years. According to the patient’s report, a biopsy was performed several years ago at an outside institution, and the diagnosis was xanthelasma. She denied visual changes.

The patient's current presentation is concerning for orbital pseudotumor, a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition of the orbit. Orbital pseudotumor is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the differential diagnosis includes a variety of other inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic conditions.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with orbital pseudotumor. The bilateral periorbital swelling, yellow lesions, and ptosis are all characteristic findings of orbital pseudotumor. The patient's visual acuity is normal, and her intraocular pressures are normal, which suggests that the orbital pseudotumor is not causing any significant optic nerve compression.

The computed tomographic scan shows preseptal soft tissue swelling in both eyes and an extraconal left lacrimal gland mass extending behind the globe. These findings are also consistent with orbital pseudotumor.

The patient's biopsy report from several years ago showed the diagnosis of xanthelasma. However, xanthelasma is a benign condition that does not typically cause periorbital swelling, ptosis, or visual changes. Therefore, the patient's current presentation is more likely due to orbital pseudotumor than xanthelasma.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the orbital mass. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. Once the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor is confirmed, the patient can be treated with oral corticosteroids. Corticosteroid therapy is typically effective in treating orbital pseudotumor. However, some patients may require long-term corticosteroid treatment or other immunosuppressive therapies, such as azathioprine or methotrexate.

Title: Photophobia After Laser Eyebrow Epilation Case is: A 29-year-old white woman presented for a second opinion of left eye pain, blurred vision, and photophobia. Six weeks before, she received eyebrow laser epilation with an 800-nm diode laser (LightSheer; Lumenis). During the session, the physician assistant removed the metal eye shield for better exposure, immediately after which the patient developed eye pain and blurred vision. She was initially treated for acute iritis with difluprednate, 4 times daily, which was tapered to once daily, with minimal improvement in her symptoms. The patient reported a negative review of systems and denied recent travel, trauma, use of antibiotics, or pregnancy. Her examination was notable for best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 OU, anterior chamber (AC) pigment and flare in the left eye, and iris irregularities, including decreased iris reactivity, peripupillary transillumination defects (Figure, A), and posterior synechiae. She had mild intraocular pressure (IOP) asymmetry of 12 mm Hg OD and 17 mm Hg OS.A, An irregular pupil, iris atrophy, and peripupillary transillumination defects are observed. B, After discontinuation of the cycloplegic agent, posterior concavity of the iris and iris-lens touch consistent with reverse pupillary block are observed.Gonioscopy revealed increased trabecular meshwork pigmentation in the left eye. Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography demonstrated a normal anterior segment in the right eye and posterior bowing of the iris and lens-iris touch (Figure, B) with a normal AC depth in the left eye. Optical biometry (Lenstar LS 900; Haag-Streit) was unremarkable bilaterally, with normal axial length, AC depth, and lens thickness.Further taper her corticosteroid dosage and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiaePerform AC paracentesis and send fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysisWhat Would You Do Next? A: Increase her topical corticosteroid dosage , B: Further taper her corticosteroid dosage and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae , C: Perform AC paracentesis and send fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis , D: Perform urgent peripheral iridotomy given IOP asymmetry. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **D: Perform urgent peripheral iridotomy given IOP asymmetry.**

The patient has acute iritis with posterior synechiae and IOP asymmetry. These findings are consistent with angle closure glaucoma. Peripheral iridotomy is the treatment of choice for angle closure glaucoma. It creates an opening in the iris, allowing aqueous humor to flow from the anterior chamber to the posterior chamber, which helps to lower IOP.

Increasing the corticosteroid dosage would not be helpful in this case, as it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Starting a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae would also not be helpful, as it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and could potentially worsen the IOP asymmetry. Performing an AC paracentesis and sending fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis would not be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of a viral infection.

Therefore, the only treatment option that would be likely to help the patient is to perform an urgent peripheral iridotomy. This would lower the IOP and help to prevent permanent damage to the optic nerve.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a white man in his mid-80s with an ocular history of remote left cataract extraction and a medical history of well-controlled hypertension, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis. He was referred by an outside optometrist for possible birdshot chorioretinopathy.

On examination, the patient has best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination reveals ocular surface dryness and a nuclear sclerotic cataract in the right eye. On dilated fundoscopy, multiple yellow-white subretinal deposits are scattered throughout the left posterior pole, with parafoveal coalescence but sparing the far periphery. There is no concomitant vitritis. Optical coherence tomography shows choroidal thickening and irregularity of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium. The right eye is unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes birdshot chorioretinopathy, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, and sarcoidosis. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a chronic, multifocal, inflammatory disorder of the choroid that typically affects middle-aged and older adults. It is characterized by the presence of multiple, small, white subretinal lesions. The lesions are usually scattered throughout the posterior pole, but they can also involve the periphery. There is often associated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid.

Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis is a non-infectious, inflammatory disorder of the uveal tract that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by the presence of multiple, small, white subretinal lesions, as well as inflammation of the vitreous, anterior chamber, and choroid. The lesions are usually scattered throughout the posterior pole, but they can also involve the periphery. There is often associated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas in multiple organs, including the eyes. The ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis can include uveitis, keratitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic neuropathy.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is birdshot chorioretinopathy. This is based on the patient's age, history of remote left cataract extraction, and the presence of multiple, small, white subretinal lesions on fundoscopy. The lesions are scattered throughout the posterior pole, with parafoveal coalescence but sparing the far periphery. There is no concomitant vitritis.

The next step in management is to obtain laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis of birdshot chorioretinopathy. These tests may include a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme level. HLA-A29 testing may also be performed, as this is a genetic marker that is associated with birdshot chorioretinopathy.

If the diagnosis of birdshot chorioretinopathy is confirmed, the patient may be treated with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression. The goal of treatment is to suppress the inflammation and prevent further damage to the choroid and retina.

Title: A Poorly Differentiated Lung Malignancy in a Young Adult Case is: A young man in his early 20s presented with a 1-day history of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, with no fever or cough. He smoked approximately 10 cigarettes per day for 4 years. Results of the physical examination were unremarkable. Radiography of the chest revealed an ill-defined consolidation in the right lower lung field. Laboratory investigations were significant for elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (273 U/L; reference range, 135-225 U/L [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]), C-reactive protein (125.3 mg/L; reference range, 0.0-4.9 mg/L [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524]), and alkaline phosphatase (217 U/L; reference range, 40-129 U/L [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]). Computed tomography of the chest confirmed the presence of a dense consolidation involving most of the right middle lobe with right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure, A). He underwent endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a fleshy, whitish endobronchial lesion obstructing both uptakes to the medial and lateral segments. Histologic analysis revealed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm (Figure, B). Most of the cells were relatively monotonous, with enlarged vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and a high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Foci of abrupt squamous differentiation, including keratinization and intercellular bridges, were identified. Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for keratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, and p63. However, findings were negative for S-100, melan A, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD45, and cytokeratin 7. A positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed a fludeoxyglucose-enhanced avid right middle lobe mass, a large right-sided pleural effusion, and fludeoxyglucose-enhanced avid mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, with extensive skeletal metastases to both proximal humeri and scapulae, the sacrum, spine, iliac bones, and both hips.A, Computed tomography of the chest revealed a dense consolidation in the middle lobe of the right lung with right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.

The most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. This is supported by the patient's history of smoking, the presence of a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm on histologic examination, and the positive immunohistochemical staining for keratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, and p63. The negative immunohistochemical staining for S-100, melan A, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD45, and cytokeratin 7 helps to further support the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.

The differential diagnosis includes other types of lung cancer, such as adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. However, the history, physical examination, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and histologic findings are all most consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 62-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department after she was found unresponsive on the ground with a presumed cardiac arrest. She had pulseless electrical activity. After resuscitation, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. She remained comatose and was intubated for airway protection. She had a history of deep vein thrombosis 3 years prior but was not receiving long-term anticoagulation.

Laboratory findings were notable only for a troponin T level of 2.41 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a point-of-care transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were obtained.

The ECG shows a sinus tachycardia with a rate of 100 beats per minute. There is no ST-segment elevation or depression, and there are no arrhythmias. The TTE shows a normal-sized left ventricle with normal systolic function. There is no valvular disease or evidence of intracardiac thrombus.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. The ECG and TTE findings are reassuring and do not suggest a specific cause of the cardiogenic shock. The next step in management is to determine the cause of the cardiogenic shock. This can be done with a cardiac catheterization, which will allow for assessment of coronary artery disease and myocardial function. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of neurological symptoms. A pulmonary CT angiography is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. A transesophageal echocardiography is not necessary in this case, as the TTE findings are reassuring.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a male in his 50s with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, colon adenocarcinoma, and hyperuricemia. He presented with a right vocal fold mass that had been an incidental finding during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. He denied any symptoms related to the lesion, including dysphonia or dysphagia, and reported no fevers or weight loss. Rigid stroboscopy revealed normal vocal fold mobility and a nodular cystic-appearing lesion on the posterior inferior border of the right vocal process. There was no overlying ulceration, and vocal fold mucosal wave was intact in the adjacent membranous vocal fold. Suspension microlaryngoscopy incisional biopsy of the right infraglottic lesion was performed in the operating room. The endotracheal tube was displaced anteriorly with the laryngoscope. Intraoperatively, there was submucosal white caseous debris in the substance of the lesion. The surgical specimen was sent for histopathologic analysis. Cultures were analyzed for the presence of fungus, bacteria, and mycobacteria. Postoperatively, the patient was doing well and continued to have no symptoms of dysphagia or dysphonia.

The most likely diagnosis is **vocal fold granuloma**. This is a benign lesion that can occur secondary to vocal abuse, such as shouting or overuse of the voice. It can also be caused by chronic inflammation, such as from reflux laryngitis. The typical presentation is a unilateral, smooth, non-tender mass on the vocal fold. Symptoms may include hoarseness, breathiness, and pain with speaking. Treatment is usually with voice rest and/or steroids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the granuloma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare condition that is usually seen in patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunocompromised states. It typically presents with fever, weight loss, and hoarseness. Laryngeal gout is a rare condition that is seen in patients with hyperuricemia. It typically presents with a painful, red, swollen vocal fold. Laryngeal amyloidosis is a rare condition that is seen in patients with amyloidosis. It typically presents with a hoarseness, breathlessness, and stridor.

Title: An Unusual Entity Presenting as Bilateral Cervical Lymphadenopathy Case is: A farmer in his 50s presented with bilateral periauricular swelling that began 6 months prior (Figure 1). The swelling was mild at onset and gradually progressive. There was no history of associated pain, but he reported occasional pruritus over the swelling. There was no history of fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. He denied any history of similar swelling elsewhere in his body. General physical and systemic examination had normal results. On examination of the swelling on the right side, there was a diffuse swelling around the pinna measuring approximately 6 cm over the preauricular, postauricular, and infra-auricular region. It was a nontender, soft swelling without fluctuation and abnormal pulsations. There were similar findings in the left side. Mouth opening was adequate, secretions from both parotid ducts were normal, and facial nerve function was intact on both sides. He had undergone fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy. The results of both were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis. He was prescribed oral antibiotics for 1 week but showed no improvement. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck showed bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, the largest measuring 16 × 11 mm2 on the right side and 15.4 × 10.6 mm2 on the left, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes, the largest measuring 16.4 × 10.2 mm2 on the right and 15.3 × 10.7 mm2 on the left side. His serum eosinophil count was slightly elevated, and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm/h. However, the IgE level was not measured. He was then scheduled for excisional biopsy at our center. The biopsy specimen included skin and subcutaneous tissue along with 2 underlying lymph nodes.Clinical photographs showing diffuse swelling of the preauricular, infra-auricular, and postauricular region.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient in this case presents with a 6-month history of bilateral periauricular swelling. The swelling is nontender, soft, and without fluctuation or abnormal pulsations. There is no history of fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. The patient is a farmer, which suggests that he may have been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the head and neck shows bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region, along with bilateral intraparotid nodes. The patient's serum eosinophil count is slightly elevated, and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Hodgkin lymphoma, tuberculous lymphadenitis, Kimura disease, and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Hodgkin lymphoma is a malignancy of the B-cell lymphocytes that typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes are often enlarged, firm, and rubbery. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma may also have fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

Tuberculous lymphadenitis is a chronic infection of the lymph nodes caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The lymph nodes are typically enlarged, tender, and matted together. Patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis may also have fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, angioedema, and eosinophilia. The lymph nodes are typically enlarged, soft, and nontender. Patients with Kimura disease may also have fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a benign, self-limiting disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, angiomatous lesions, and eosinophilia. The lymph nodes are typically enlarged, soft, and nontender. Patients with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia may also have fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Kimura disease.

**Answer:**

C. Kimura disease

Title: Rapidly Enlarging Parapharyngeal Mass Case is: A man in his 40s with Poland syndrome presented with a 6-month history of left throat pain and enlarging oropharyngeal mass. The patient had been seen repeatedly for odynophagia that persisted despite multiple courses of antibiotics, reflux medications, and steroids prescribed at clinics and emergency departments. Over the course of 5 months, he underwent a tonsillectomy and 3 separate biopsies at multiple institutions. All showed inconclusive results, and the mass progressively enlarged. At presentation for the present report, physical examination showed a 2-cm, well-mucosalized, left oropharyngeal mass not extending to the hard palate (Figure, A). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 58-mm parapharyngeal mass lateralizing and narrowing the left carotid artery against the styloid process (Figure, B). A CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed but again was nondiagnostic. Further confounding the clinical picture, a pacemaker was required for multiple episodes of sinus asystole due to mass effect on the carotid body. To obtain the diagnosis of the parapharyngeal mass, the patient had a transcervical resection with transoral partial glossectomy, palatectomy, and pharyngectomy with reconstruction. Results of immunohistochemical analysis of the removed tissue were positive for CD4 (weak), CD21, CD23, and vimentin with a low proliferation rate (Figure, C and D).A, A 2-cm well-mucosalized left oropharyngeal soft-palate mass anterior to the tonsillar bed with surrounding erythema.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of odynophagia, a 6-month history of enlarging oropharyngeal mass, and a tonsillectomy and 3 separate biopsies at multiple institutions with inconclusive results are all consistent with a diagnosis of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS). FDCS is a rare, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents in the head and neck, with a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life. It is most often seen in men, and patients with Poland syndrome are at an increased risk of developing FDCS. The CT scan shows a 58-mm parapharyngeal mass lateralizing and narrowing the left carotid artery against the styloid process, which is also consistent with FDCS. The CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was nondiagnostic, which is not uncommon in FDCS. The patient's pacemaker was required for multiple episodes of sinus asystole due to mass effect on the carotid body, which is a rare but serious complication of FDCS. The patient underwent a transcervical resection with transoral partial glossectomy, palatectomy, and pharyngectomy with reconstruction. Results of immunohistochemical analysis of the removed tissue were positive for CD4 (weak), CD21, CD23, and vimentin with a low proliferation rate. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of FDCS.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of bariatric gastric bypass surgery, hysterectomy, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, and recent ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization. She presents with acute abdominal pain and a preoperative chest computed tomography scan reveals multiple lung nodules of variable sizes, predominantly in the lower lobes.

The differential diagnosis for multiple lung nodules includes infection, malignancy, and granulomatous disease. In this case, the patient's history of bariatric surgery and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy puts her at increased risk for right-sided endocarditis. Right-sided endocarditis can present with fever, abdominal pain, and pulmonary nodules. Therefore, the next step in management should be to perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient has a hyperpigmented macule on the medial side of her right palm with hypoesthesia. She has a history of living in Bangladesh, where she visited 5 months ago. She was treated with doxycycline, ofloxacin, and rifampin in Bangladesh, but experienced no improvement. On physical examination, there is a mildly erythematous macule located over the medial aspect of the right palm, with loss of touch and temperature sensation over the involved area. A thickened, nontender ulnar nerve is palpated on the ipsilateral side in the olecranon fossa.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes leprosy, Hansen's disease, and sarcoidosis. Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and loss of sensation. Hansen's disease is a chronic, granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. It is characterized by skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and fever. Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown cause. It is characterized by noncaseating granulomas in multiple organs.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is leprosy. The patient has a history of living in Bangladesh, where leprosy is endemic. She has a skin lesion that is consistent with leprosy. She has also had nerve damage, which is a common complication of leprosy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve. The biopsy will help to confirm the diagnosis of leprosy and to determine the type of leprosy. The type of leprosy will determine the treatment regimen.

Title: Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography for Diagnosing Cirrhosis and Staging Hepatic Fibrosis Case is: A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b 5 years ago. He had no evidence of advanced liver disease (eg, thrombocytopenia). Liver ultrasound showed no signs of cirrhosis, such as nodularity. Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) performed prior to treatment was negative for signficant fibrosis at 6.7 kPa. Hepatitis C was cured, based on viral load, with simeprevir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. He presents for follow-up. Laboratory studies and VCTE were performed (Table 1).The patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage.How Do You Interpret These Results? A: The patient has cirrhosis. , B: The patient has a healthy liver. , C: The patient has minimal fibrosis. , D: The patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient has chronic hepatitis C, a liver disease that can cause cirrhosis. However, he had no evidence of advanced liver disease before treatment, and his liver ultrasound showed no signs of cirrhosis. Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), a non-invasive test that measures the stiffness of the liver, was negative for significant fibrosis at 6.7 kPa. This suggests that the patient does not have cirrhosis. However, VCTE is not a perfect test, and it is possible that the patient has early cirrhosis that was not detected by the test. Therefore, the patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm the fibrosis stage.

Title: Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Case is: A 65-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with concerns about large fluctuations in her blood pressure (BP). The patient’s home BP measurements were often lower than 120/80 mm Hg but sometimes reached 200/100 mm Hg. She had a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 1 year ago and was treated with a drug-eluting stent in her right coronary artery. Her antihypertensive medications included carvedilol (12.5 mg, twice daily), lisinopril (40 mg daily), and chlorthalidone (12.5 mg daily). Additionally, the patient had generalized anxiety and panic disorders (treated with paroxetine, 30 mg), and she smoked for 90 pack-years but quit 2 months ago. The patient’s office BP measurement was 127/74 mm Hg. Her physical examination was unremarkable.Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed to evaluate patterns of elevated BP and potential etiologies. The patient kept a log of her diet, sleep pattern, and symptoms. Mean BP levels were 133/86 mm Hg overall (normal, <130/80 mm Hg); daytime, 135/88 mm Hg (normal, <135/85 mm Hg); and sleeping, 124/78 mm Hg (normal, <120/70 mm Hg).1 During the first sudden increase in BP (04:00-06:00; Figure), she awoke from sleep with a panic attack. The second sudden increase (07:00-10:00) occurred after eating a high-sodium breakfast.The patient has normal BP since the office BP was normal.How Do You Interpret These Results?

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a 2-year history of a pruritic and sometimes burning hyperpigmented eruption on the bilateral palms. The eruption had gradually spread from the left palm to the right palm and then focally onto the bilateral volar aspect of the wrists in recent months. She had not experienced involvement of the plantar surfaces. No additional concerns were reported, and there was no family history of similar lesions. There was no known history of travel in relation to onset of the lesions. Limited clinical examination revealed well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. Two punch biopsy specimens were obtained for diagnostic clarification.

The differential diagnosis for an atrophic and spiny eruption of the palms includes lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, acquired palmoplantar keratoderma, and sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome).

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin that typically affects the genital and perianal areas, but can also involve the skin of the palms and soles. It is characterized by white, atrophic patches with a smooth, shiny surface. The lesions may be pruritic and sometimes painful.

Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a rare, chronic skin disorder that is characterized by atrophic, erythematous patches on the extremities, particularly the hands and feet. The lesions may be pruritic and sometimes painful.

Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma is a group of disorders that are characterized by thickening of the skin of the palms and soles. The lesions may be pruritic and sometimes painful.

Sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome) is a rare, genetic disorder that is characterized by thickening of the skin of the palms and soles, as well as other areas of the body. The lesions may be pruritic and sometimes painful.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. The patient's eruption is characterized by well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. These findings are typical of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

The histopathologic findings of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus are also consistent with the diagnosis. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is characterized by atrophic epidermis with a thickened papillary dermis and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. These findings are also seen in the patient's biopsy specimens.

The differential diagnosis for an atrophic and spiny eruption of the palms is a broad one. However, in this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

Immunohistochemical analysis for SV40 polyomavirus was positive (Figure, D).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes trichodysplasia spinulosa, lichen spinulosus, demodecosis, and disseminated keratosis pilaris. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, non-inflammatory follicular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, small, follicular papules on the face and scalp. The papules are typically flesh-colored or brown and have a spiny appearance. Lichen spinulosus is a chronic, inflammatory follicular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, small, follicular papules on the face and upper trunk. The papules are typically erythematous and have a spiny appearance. Demodecosis is a parasitic infection of the hair follicles caused by the mite Demodex folliculorum. The mites live in the hair follicles and feed on sebum. Demodecosis can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, pustules, and folliculitis. Disseminated keratosis pilaris is a common, non-inflammatory follicular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, small, follicular papules on the arms, legs, and buttocks. The papules are typically flesh-colored or brown and have a rough, keratotic surface.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is trichodysplasia spinulosa. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, non-inflammatory follicular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, small, follicular papules on the face and scalp. The papules are typically flesh-colored or brown and have a spiny appearance. The disorder is most commonly seen in children and young adults, but it can occur at any age. The cause of trichodysplasia spinulosa is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. The disorder is not contagious. There is no cure for trichodysplasia spinulosa, but the symptoms can be treated with topical medications, such as corticosteroids and retinoids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected hair follicles.

Title: Hearing and Vision Loss in an Older Man Case is: A 63-year-old man with a history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing for several weeks. He also reported a history of painful paresthesias at his feet beginning about 1 year prior.On examination, his visual acuity was initially 20/80 OD and 20/200 OS; it deteriorated over the next 2 months to finger counting bilaterally. The Weber test gave a nonlateralizing result, and bone conduction hearing was absent bilaterally. There was length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram were normal. Nerve conduction studies showed mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin (63 mlU/ml), low levels of free thyroxine (T4) (0.2 ng/dL), and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein (94 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results were all normal.

An echocardiogram showed a left ventricle ejection fraction of 20% to 25%, which had been 55% to 60% at the last test 2 years prior. At 5 months after initial presentation, the patient developed acute worsening of dyspnea and was admitted for respiratory distress. He was found to have nonischemic cardiomyopathy and died on hospital day 13.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease) , B: Amyloidosis , C: Susac syndrome , D: Cobalt toxicity. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient presents with a history of bilateral vision and hearing loss, painful paresthesias at his feet, and a nonlateralizing Weber test. On examination, he has finger counting bilateral visual acuity, absent bone conduction hearing bilaterally, and length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves. Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiogram are normal. Nerve conduction studies show mild sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Laboratory tests are notable for elevated thyrotropin, low levels of free thyroxine, and elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein. Cerebrospinal fluid IgG index, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin 4 antibody, paraneoplastic panel, and protein electrophoresis test results are all normal. He was treated empirically with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, with no improvement in symptoms.

The most likely diagnosis is Susac syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by bilateral optic neuritis, sensorineural hearing loss, and cerebral vasculitis. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and confirmed by laboratory testing, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. There is no cure for Susac syndrome, but treatment with steroids and plasmapheresis can help to improve symptoms.

Other possible diagnoses include neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease), amyloidosis, and cobalt toxicity. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history, presentation, and laboratory findings.

Electrolyte levels and liver function test results were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement was performed (Figure).Axial cross-sectional computed tomograms of the patient’s abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement show segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum (A) and bilateral renal hypodensities (B).

The most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis. This is supported by the patient's history of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena. The patient also has a leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which is a non-specific finding that is often seen in patients with appendicitis. The computed tomography findings of segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis are highly suggestive of appendicitis.

Other possible diagnoses include colonic ischemia, diverticulitis with perforation, and infectious colitis. However, these diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a postmenopausal woman with a known history of endometriosis and adenomyosis. She presents with severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, she is afebrile and her abdomen is soft and nondistended without guarding or rebound but tender in the left lower quadrant. She has a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen on bimanual examination. Laboratory investigations had normal findings with the exception of an elevated cancer antigen 125 level of 158 U/mL. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple abnormal findings that included a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants.

The most likely diagnosis is rupture of an infected endometriotic implant. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. This tissue can implant on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, bowel, or other organs. Endometriosis can cause pain, infertility, and other problems. When endometriosis implants rupture, they can bleed and become infected. This can cause severe pain, fever, and other symptoms.

The CT scan findings are consistent with a diagnosis of endometriosis. The bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium and the endometriomas are characteristic of endometriosis. The right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants are all findings that can be seen in patients with endometriosis.

The MRI findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of endometriosis. The 2 areas of focus that correspond with the extracolonic implants are characteristic of endometriosis.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of rupture of an infected endometriotic implant.

Title: Unilateral Eyelid Swelling With Submandibular Lymph Node Enlargement Case is: A woman in her early 50s with hypothyroidism and a 10-month history of painless lumps in her neck presented with achiness and decreased visual acuity in her right eye for 2 months. Associated symptoms included dysphagia and fever and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of 1 of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. The patient was referred for evaluation in our clinic.Ocular history was noncontributory. On examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was unremarkable and ocular motility was intact in both eyes.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-neoplastic, inflammatory disorder of the orbit that can affect any age group, but is most common in middle-aged women. The most common symptoms are pain, swelling, and redness of the eye. Other symptoms may include decreased visual acuity, diplopia, and proptosis. The diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor is made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment of orbital pseudotumor typically involves the use of corticosteroids, either orally or by injection. In some cases, other medications such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be used. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the inflamed tissue.

In the case of the patient described above, the most appropriate next step is to treat her with oral corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are effective in reducing inflammation and relieving the symptoms of orbital pseudotumor. In most cases, treatment with corticosteroids is successful in controlling the disease. However, some patients may require long-term treatment or may experience relapses after treatment is stopped.

Title: Hidden Globe in an Infant Case is: A healthy 7-month-old boy presented for oculoplastic evaluation with an enlarging right periorbital mass. He was born full term with no complications during pregnancy or delivery. The parents noticed asymmetry between the child’s eyes since birth and progressive right lower eyelid fullness. He was seen by his pediatrician, a general ophthalmologist, and a pediatric ophthalmologist before presenting to our institution. On examination, the boy fussed when his left eye was covered, and his left eye was able to fixate and follow. The right globe could not be visualized within the palpebral fissure because of a large compressible mass that transilluminated (Figure, A). The remainder of the left eye examination findings were noncontributory. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging was ordered (Figure, B).A, Clinical photograph of child at presentation displaying a right orbital cyst.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The mass in this patient is a dermoid cyst, which is a congenital anomaly that arises from the ectoderm. Dermoid cysts are typically filled with keratin and sebaceous material, and they can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. In the orbit, dermoid cysts are typically located in the superotemporal quadrant, and they can cause proptosis, eyelid swelling, and vision loss.

The treatment of choice for a dermoid cyst is surgical excision. Aspiration or needle biopsy is not recommended, as this can lead to infection and recurrence of the cyst. Radiotherapy is not effective in treating dermoid cysts, and it can cause significant side effects. Intralesional corticosteroids can be used to shrink a dermoid cyst, but they are not curative.

Title: A Child With Unilateral Conjunctivitis and Elevated Inflammatory Markers Case is: A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented to an outside hospital for fever, headache, and unilateral red eye with periorbital edema. He received oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 2 days of intravenous clindamycin phosphate and ceftriaxone sodium. On transfer to our institution for failure to improve and concern for orbital cellulitis, results of examination by the ophthalmology service revealed a unilateral hemorrhagic conjunctivitis without orbital signs, and computed tomography showed mild preseptal edema. The patient was discharged with a tentative diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis.Three days later, the patient returned with fever, prominent submandibular lymphadenopathy, and ipsilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis (Figure). Results of the remainder of the anterior segment and dilated examination were unremarkable. Results of laboratory tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein level, 9.47 mg/dL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524], and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 48 mm/h), neutrophilic leukocytosis, and normocytic anemia. Additional history revealed that the boy had handled a bloody raccoon carcass without gloves several days before initial presentation. The pediatrics service planned to restart antibiotic therapy.External photograph of the left eye demonstrating periorbital edema, lash crusting, and follicular conjunctivitis with a granuloma in the inferolateral fornix.Perform conjunctival cultures on blood, chocolate, Löwenstein-Jensen, Sabouraud, and thioglycolate media before restarting antibiotic therapyProvide reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limitedPerform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensisWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: A. Perform conjunctival cultures on blood, chocolate, Löwenstein-Jensen, Sabouraud, and thioglycolate media before restarting antibiotic therapy.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of handling a bloody raccoon carcass without gloves, which puts him at risk for Bartonella henselae infection. Bartonella henselae is a bacterium that can cause cat scratch disease, which is a common cause of granulomatous conjunctivitis. Conjunctival cultures are the most sensitive test for Bartonella henselae infection. Blood, chocolate, Löwenstein-Jensen, Sabouraud, and thioglycolate media are all appropriate media for growing Bartonella henselae.

Reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limited is not appropriate in this case, as the patient has signs and symptoms that are concerning for a more serious infection. Repeated computed tomography of orbits with contrast is not necessary, as the patient's initial computed tomography scan showed mild preseptal edema.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform conjunctival cultures on blood, chocolate, Löwenstein-Jensen, Sabouraud, and thioglycolate media before restarting antibiotic therapy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a white man in his early 50s who presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of sudden decreased visual acuity in the right eye. He denied any recent trauma, flashes, floaters, pain, or any prior similar episodes. His medical history is remarkable for asthma and prostate cancer, and review of systems is negative except for his visual loss.

On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity is 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. Pupils are reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, and intraocular pressure measurements are unremarkable, as are results of the external and slitlamp examinations. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment. Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye were unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye revealed subretinal and sub–retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hemorrhage; results were unremarkable in the left eye.

The differential diagnosis for sudden-onset unilateral macular hemorrhage in a middle-aged man includes age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).

AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. It is a chronic, progressive disease that affects the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. AMD can cause a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, dark spots in the vision, and loss of central vision.

RVO is a blockage of a vein in the retina. It can cause a sudden loss of vision in one eye. RVO can be caused by a number of factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.

CRAO is a blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the retina. It can cause a sudden, severe loss of vision in one eye. CRAO is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.

PVD is the separation of the vitreous humor from the retina. It is a common condition that usually occurs in people over the age of 50. PVD can cause a variety of symptoms, including flashes of light, floaters, and blurred vision.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to determine the cause of the macular hemorrhage. The most likely cause is AMD. However, other causes, such as RVO, CRAO, and PVD, should also be considered.

To determine the cause of the macular hemorrhage, the patient should undergo fluorescein angiography and/or indocyanine green angiography. These tests are used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. They can help to identify the cause of the hemorrhage and to determine the extent of the damage.

If the patient has AMD, treatment will focus on slowing the progression of the disease. This may include the use of laser therapy or photodynamic therapy.

If the patient has RVO, treatment will focus on restoring blood flow to the retina. This may include the use of medications or surgery.

If the patient has CRAO, treatment will focus on preventing further damage to the retina. This may include the use of medications or surgery.

If the patient has PVD, treatment is usually not necessary. However, if the patient is experiencing symptoms, such as flashes of light, floaters, or blurred vision, treatment may be necessary.

Title: Sudden Unilateral Decrease in Vision in a Healthy Middle-aged Man Case is: A previously healthy man in his 50s presented with a 1-day history of sudden painful decreased vision in the right eye. On examination, his visual acuity was counting fingers at 3 ft OD and 20/20 OS. A slitlamp examination of the right eye revealed conjunctival hyperemia, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates in the inferior half of the corneal endothelium, and 3+ cells in the anterior chamber, while results of a dilated fundus examination showed 1+ vitritis, 360° of optic nerve swelling, intraretinal hemorrhages predominantly along the distribution of the retinal arteries and arterioles, and perivascular sheathing, as well as macula involving retinal whitening, thickening, and subretinal fluid (Figure, A). Fluorescein angiography revealed late vascular leakage with both arterial and venous involvement (Figure, B) and peripheral ischemia. Examination of the left eye revealed no abnormalities.A, Wide-field photograph of the right eye demonstrates optic nerve edema (white arrowhead), scattered intraretinal hemorrhages (red arrowheads), perivascular sheathing (yellow arrowheads), and retinal whitening and thickening with subretinal fluid in the macula extending inferiorly (blue arrowheads).

**Reasoning:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a severe form of posterior uveitis that is typically caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). ARN is a sight-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.

The initial step in the management of ARN is to obtain a sample of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. This test can confirm the diagnosis of ARN and identify the specific viral strain involved. If the PCR test is positive, the patient should be started on intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy.

In addition to antiviral therapy, patients with ARN may also benefit from topical corticosteroid therapy to reduce inflammation and swelling in the eye. In some cases, pars plana vitrectomy may be necessary to remove vitreous hemorrhage and inflammatory debris from the eye.

Title: Macular Vitelliform-Like Lesion in an Eye With Chronic Retinal Detachment Case is: A 41-year-old woman with a history of ocular hypertension (and using brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate) was referred by her ophthalmologist for a second opinion regarding yellowish subfoveal precipitates in her left eye. Three months earlier, she had undergone pneumatic retinopexy for macula-on retinal detachment (RD) with a superotemporal tear, followed by vitrectomy with gas injection for macula-on inferonasal detachment 1 month later. She had persistent postoperative subretinal fluid inferonasally, and she was concerned about a central scotoma. An examination within 2 months of the vitrectomy revealed yellowish subfoveal precipitates. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/200 OS. Extraocular motility was full, but she displayed left exotropia. Confrontational visual fields were full for the right eye but showed a decreased field inferiorly for the left eye. Intraocular pressures as determined using Tonopen tonometry were 13 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. A slitlamp examination revealed trace nuclear sclerosis and pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous of the left eye. An ophthalmoscopic examination indicated laser and cryotherapy scars 360° around a horseshoe tear superotemporally in the left eye, whereas the right eye appeared normal. In addition, pre-equatorial subretinal fluid in the left eye between the 6-o’clock and 8:30 position was associated with 2 tiny holes at the 7:30 position and with a small area of fibrotic tissue contraction consistent with early proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The macula had yellow-white, flat, vitelliform-like lesions with a surrounding high watermark (Figure). No cyst, exudate, or hemorrhage was detected in the macula.Color fundus photograph of the left eye demonstrating yellow-white vitelliform-like deposits in the fovea surrounded by a high watermark.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of ocular hypertension and has undergone pneumatic retinopexy and vitrectomy for retinal detachment. She currently has persistent subretinal fluid and a central scotoma. The yellowish subfoveal precipitates are concerning for subretinal fibrosis, which can lead to permanent vision loss.

Answer: D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This allows the surgeon to access and treat the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Endolaser is a type of laser that is used to treat retinal tears and detachments.

In this case, the patient has a chronic retinal detachment with persistent subretinal fluid. The yellowish subfoveal precipitates are concerning for subretinal fibrosis, which can lead to permanent vision loss. Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser is the most effective treatment for this condition. It will remove the vitreous humor, which is preventing the retina from adhering to the back of the eye. It will also allow the surgeon to treat the retinal tear and detachment with endolaser. This will help to prevent further vision loss and may even improve the patient's vision.

The lesion is a 4.0 × 2.0-cm, oval-shaped violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia. The patient is afebrile, and vital signs are stable. The complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 1800/μL, with 2% neutrophils (absolute neutrophil count, 36/μL), hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL. Her blood glucose level was 326 mg/dL.

The most likely diagnosis is leukemia cutis. Leukemia cutis is a cutaneous manifestation of ALL that occurs in up to 20% of patients. It typically presents as a single or multiple violaceous to black plaques or nodules on the skin. The lesions may be associated with fever, chills, and malaise. Leukemia cutis is a serious complication of ALL, and it is associated with a poor prognosis.

The differential diagnosis for leukemia cutis includes pyoderma gangrenosum, brown recluse envenomation, and mucormycosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a skin condition that is characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers. It is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but it can also occur in patients with leukemia. Brown recluse envenomation is a rare but serious condition that is caused by the bite of a brown recluse spider. It can cause local tissue necrosis, fever, and chills. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that can cause life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. It can present as skin lesions, sinusitis, or pneumonia.

The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made by biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy specimen will show infiltration of the skin by leukemic cells. The treatment of leukemia cutis is with chemotherapy. The patient should be referred to a hematologist-oncologist for treatment.

**Reasoning:** The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease with mechanical mitral and tricuspid valve replacements, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, antiphospholipid syndrome, recurrent embolic strokes, and prior spontaneous subdural hematomas while taking warfarin therapy. She presents with 1 week of shortness of breath and fatigue, gradual weight gain over the previous month despite diuretic and diet compliance, and well-controlled international normalized ratios in the range of 3.0 to 3.5. Physical examination reveals jugular venous pressure of 13 cm H2O, crisp mechanical S1 heart sound, and pitting edema in the lower extremities. Transthoracic echocardiogram shows no pericardial effusion, normal left ventricular systolic function, a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with normal gradients, a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic right ventricle, and an elevated mean tricuspid valve gradient.

The elevated mean tricuspid valve gradient suggests right ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with right heart failure. Right heart catheterization is the best test to confirm the diagnosis of right heart failure and to assess the severity of the disease. It can also be used to guide treatment decisions.

**Answer:** C. Perform right heart catheterization.

Title: Coagulation Test Interpretation in a Patient Taking Direct Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Case is: A 74-year-old man presented with spontaneous, acute onset of confusion and headache. He had no preceding head trauma or falls. He had a history of atrial fibrillation with an annual stroke risk of 2.9% (based on points accrued for hypertension and age ≥65 years using the CHA2DS2-VASc score1). He was being treated with rivaroxaban, 20 mg daily. He took his last dose 14 hours prior to presentation. Other medications included ramipril and rosuvastatin.On physical examination, the patient’s blood pressure was 157/96 mm Hg, heart rate was 72/min, and Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 (range, 3-15 with 15 indicating best neurological status). Head computed tomogram (CT) showed a 2.5-cm left-sided acute subdural hematoma with mass effect. He required urgent surgical evacuation and the neurosurgical team requested advice regarding his perioperative bleeding risk prior to surgery. Laboratory test results are shown in the Table.The patient’s hemostatic status is appropriate for surgery because aPTT is normal, which rules out anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.The patient’s hemostatic status cannot be assessed because the thrombin clotting time is unknown.The patient’s hemostatic status cannot be assessed because the INR is unknown.How Do You Interpret These Results? A: The patient’s hemostatic status is appropriate for surgery because aPTT is normal, which rules out anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban. , B: The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban. , C: The patient’s hemostatic status cannot be assessed because the thrombin clotting time is unknown. , D: The patient’s hemostatic status cannot be assessed because the INR is unknown.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The aPTT is a test that measures how long it takes blood to clot. The PT is a test that measures how long it takes blood to clot after adding a substance called thromboplastin. The INR is a test that measures how much longer it takes blood to clot for people who are taking warfarin, a blood thinner.

In this case, the patient's aPTT is normal, but his PT is abnormal. This suggests that the patient is taking a blood thinner, such as rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that prevents blood clots by blocking the action of factor Xa. Factor Xa is a protein that is involved in the coagulation cascade, a series of reactions that leads to the formation of blood clots.

The patient's PT is abnormal because rivaroxaban is blocking the action of factor Xa. This means that the patient's blood is more likely to clot. If the patient were to undergo surgery, he would be at an increased risk of bleeding.

**Answer:**

The correct answer is B: The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.

Title: Diagnostic Testing for Elevated Cortisol in the Setting of an Adrenal Mass Case is: A 66-year-old man with history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia presented with a 3.1-cm left adrenal mass, detected on a computed tomographic (CT) scan (performed to evaluate bilateral lung infiltrates identified on chest radiograph during evaluation of chronic cough). He had no headache, palpitations, fatigue, muscle weakness, or weight change. His medications were glipizide, metformin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. He had no history of fractures or osteoporosis. His blood pressure was 139/88 mm Hg, heart rate 92 beats/min, and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) 37.0. Purple striae, proximal muscle weakness or supraclavicular fat pads were not present. The mass was round and homogenous with a CT attenuation of 24 Hounsfield units (HU). Laboratory evaluation was performed (Table).Perform an oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism.What Would You Do Next? A: Advise no further biochemical evaluation. , B: Obtain 24-hour urine measurement of catecholamines. , C: Perform an oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism. , D: Perform further evaluation for subclinical hypercortisolism.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia who presented with a 3.1-cm left adrenal mass. He has no headache, palpitations, fatigue, muscle weakness, or weight change. His medications are glipizide, metformin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. He has no history of fractures or osteoporosis. His blood pressure is 139/88 mm Hg, heart rate 92 beats/min, and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) 37.0. Purple striae, proximal muscle weakness or supraclavicular fat pads were not present. The mass was round and homogenous with a CT attenuation of 24 Hounsfield units (HU). Laboratory evaluation was performed (Table).

The initial evaluation of an adrenal mass should include a complete history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. The history should focus on symptoms of adrenal hyperfunction, such as hypertension, hypokalemia, and Cushing's syndrome. The physical examination should look for signs of adrenal hyperfunction, such as moon facies, buffalo hump, and striae.

Laboratory testing should include measurement of serum cortisol, aldosterone, and catecholamines. Imaging studies should include a CT scan or MRI of the adrenal glands.

In this case, the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He has no symptoms of adrenal hyperfunction. His laboratory evaluation shows a normal serum cortisol level, a normal aldosterone level, and a normal catecholamine level. His CT scan shows a 3.1-cm left adrenal mass.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform an oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism. This test is used to diagnose primary aldosteronism, which is a condition in which the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone.

Answer:
C. Perform an oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism.

Title: An Elderly Woman With Painful Buttock and Vulvar Ulcers Case is: A woman in her 80s presented to hospital with somnolence and fatigue of 2 days’ duration. Medical history included lower urinary tract symptoms of 1-week duration for which she was prescribed cotrimoxazole with no improvement. She also reported progressively worsening vulvar and buttock pain of 5 days’ duration. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit 3 weeks prior to presentation for pneumonia and remained hospitalized for 10 days. She was not sexually active and had no medical history of sexually transmitted infections. Anogenital examination revealed vulvar (Figure 1A) and buttock ulcers (Figure 1B) tender to palpation. Initial blood workup showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2400 cells/μL (to convert to cells/L, multiply by 106), a differential of 72% neutrophils, and a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL with a hematocrit differential of 27% (to convert hemoglobin to g/L, multiply by 10.0).

Title: Persistent Malar Erythema With Atrophy in a Young Woman Case is: A 21-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with a 2-year history of asymptomatic, facial redness that flared in sunlight. She had been previously treated with doxycycline, 100 mg/d, and topical sulfacetamide with no effect. On examination, on the cheeks and nasal bridge there were multiple erythematous, annular plaques with focal areas of atrophy. Her medications included only an oral birth control pill. Serum chemical analyses and complete blood cell count showed no abnormalities, and anti-Ro, anti-La, and qualitative ANA antibodies were negative. A clinical diagnosis was made, and over the next 9 months, treatments with minocycline, desonide, topical metronidazole, 0.75%, cream and azelaic acid, 15%, were unsuccessful, and the plaques developed more scarring and atrophy (Figure, A). In addition, the patient began to develop a burning sensation in these areas. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for histopathologic review (Figure, B and C).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus , B: Granuloma faciale , C: Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis , D: Rosacea-like dermatitis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 21-year-old woman with a 2-year history of facial redness that flares in sunlight. She has been previously treated with doxycycline and topical sulfacetamide with no effect. On examination, she has multiple erythematous, annular plaques with focal areas of atrophy on her cheeks and nasal bridge. Her medications include only an oral birth control pill. Serum chemical analyses and complete blood cell count showed no abnormalities, and anti-Ro, anti-La, and qualitative ANA antibodies were negative. A clinical diagnosis of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) was made, and over the next 9 months, treatments with minocycline, desonide, topical metronidazole, 0.75%, cream and azelaic acid, 15%, were unsuccessful, and the plaques developed more scarring and atrophy. In addition, the patient began to develop a burning sensation in these areas. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for histopathologic review.

The histopathologic findings are consistent with CCLE. There is a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional plasma cells and eosinophils. The dermoepidermal junction is effaced, and there is a mild acanthosis with vacuolar degeneration of the basal keratinocytes. There is also scattered pigment incontinence. These findings are characteristic of CCLE, which is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the skin. CCLE is most commonly seen in women of childbearing age, and it is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common clinical presentation of CCLE is a chronic, malar rash that flares in sunlight. The rash may be accompanied by burning, itching, and tenderness. Treatment of CCLE typically involves topical and/or systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

Title: An Annular Eruption in a Young Child Case is: A young child presented to clinic with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks (Figure, A). The eruption would wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation. Clinical examination was significant for faint, nonscaling annular serpiginous, erythematous plaques with central clearing, and barely elevated borders. Test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, and Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were within normal limits. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, and the child had not experienced any fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods. A punch biopsy specimen from the left thigh was obtained, and histopathological analysis was subsequently performed (Figure, B and C).A, Annular serpiginous plaques with areas of central clearing on the patient’s right thigh and buttocks.

Reasoning:
The patient is a young child with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks. The eruption would wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation. Clinical examination was significant for faint, nonscaling annular serpiginous, erythematous plaques with central clearing, and barely elevated borders. Test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, and Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were within normal limits. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, and the child had not experienced any fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods. A punch biopsy specimen from the left thigh was obtained, and histopathological analysis was subsequently performed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes tinea corporis, erythema marginatum, annular erythema of infancy, and erythema migrans. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the skin that typically presents as a single or multiple annular lesions with central clearing. Erythema marginatum is a rash that occurs in association with rheumatic fever and typically presents as a serpiginous eruption with central clearing. Annular erythema of infancy is a benign rash that occurs in infants and typically presents as an annular lesion with central clearing. Erythema migrans is the initial skin lesion of Lyme disease and typically presents as a large annular lesion with central clearing.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is annular erythema of infancy. This is supported by the patient's age, the history of a non-itchy, expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks that waxes and wanes, the lack of systemic symptoms, the normal laboratory results, and the absence of a history of tick exposure. The histopathological findings of a perivascular and inflammatory infiltrate that includes eosinophils are also consistent with annular erythema of infancy.

Title: A Case of Severe Intractable Contamination-Based Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Case is: A middle-aged woman was referred to an outpatient mental health clinic for symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) following a recent hospitalization. Her OCD symptoms consisted of concerns about dirt or germs and fears that she or others would get sick because of spreading these contaminants. She had extensive rituals involving washing her hands repeatedly and cleaning household items. She reported, “I wash everything anyone else touches…I hardly let anyone into our home, and if I do, I wash down furniture and often have to wash the floors.” She avoided handling groceries, mail, and money and would not visit with family members owing to concerns that they were contaminated.She had experienced OCD symptoms since age 10 years but did not formally receive a diagnosis until 10 years later. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in little benefit even at maximum doses (eg, 400 mg of fluvoxamine daily, 200 mg of sertraline daily). A trial of clomipramine up to 250 mg daily also failed to reduce her OCD symptoms. Augmentation trials of antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, were either ineffective or intolerable.In addition to OCD, she experienced periods of depression but denied any history of mania, psychosis, trauma, or substance abuse. She reported mild hoarding symptoms but denied symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, or an eating disorder. She reported a history of motor and phonic tics including eye blinking and blurting out words. Her medical history included hypothyroidism managed with thyroid hormone supplementation and fibromyalgia.Referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a severe and intractable case of contamination-based OCD. She has failed to respond to multiple treatment modalities, including SSRIs, clomipramine, and antipsychotic augmentation. She is also experiencing significant functional impairment due to her symptoms.

Given the patient's history and presentation, the next best step in her treatment is to refer her for outpatient exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. ERP is a well-established treatment for OCD that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms. It is a behavioral therapy that involves gradually exposing the patient to their feared stimuli and then helping them to resist the urge to engage in compulsive rituals.

ERP is a challenging therapy, but it can be very effective in treating OCD. The patient should be prepared for a commitment of several months of therapy. She should also be aware that ERP can sometimes trigger an initial increase in her OCD symptoms. However, with continued exposure and practice, she should see a gradual decrease in her symptoms.

Title: Subacute Progressive Ptosis, Ophthalmoplegia, Gait Instability, and Cognitive Changes Case is: A 70-year-old woman with long-term tobacco use presented with 2 weeks of bilateral ptosis and binocular horizontal diplopia. She denied weakness, difficulty swallowing, or breathing. On initial examination, she had a normal mental status, no pupillary abnormalities, normal visual acuity, and full visual fields. She had moderate exotropia, severe bilateral ptosis, impaired bilateral adduction and vertical ductions, and impaired convergence. Her abduction and vertical oculocephalic reflexes were intact. She had full strength and normal sensation and reflexes but had a slightly wide-based and unsteady gait. Over the subsequent weeks, she experienced worsening gait, falls, inattention, and short-term memory loss.Her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast results were unremarkable. The test results for acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the muscle-specific kinase antibody were negative. Her electrodiagnostic test results with repetitive stimulation and single fiber electromyography were unremarkable and there was no evidence of neuropathy. The test results for thyrotropin, thiamine level, Lyme antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, and the serum ganglioside antibody panel were unremarkable. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a nucleated cell count of 6/μL (to convert to ×109 liters, multiply by 0.001) with 88% lymphocytes (to convert to the proportion of 1.0, multiply by 0.01), a red blood cell count of 10/μL, a protein level of 0.087 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and glucose level of 63 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). Serum paraneoplastic antibody testing results were negative for anti-Hu, Ri, Yo, and voltage-gated potassium channel complex (VGKCC) antibodies, and the CSF had negative results for anti-VGKCC, voltage-gated calcium channel, Hu, Ri, Yo, and amphiphysin antibodies. A repeated brain MRI 3 weeks later revealed an interval development of T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in the right thalamus, inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus (Figure).Repeated brain magnetic resonance imaging 3 weeks after the patient’s initial presentation: T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities (arrowheads) in the right inferior temporal gyrus (A) and right thalamus (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with long-term tobacco use who presented with 2 weeks of bilateral ptosis and binocular horizontal diplopia. She denied weakness, difficulty swallowing, or breathing. On initial examination, she had a normal mental status, no pupillary abnormalities, normal visual acuity, and full visual fields. She had moderate exotropia, severe bilateral ptosis, impaired bilateral adduction and vertical ductions, and impaired convergence. Her abduction and vertical oculocephalic reflexes were intact. She had full strength and normal sensation and reflexes but had a slightly wide-based and unsteady gait. Over the subsequent weeks, she experienced worsening gait, falls, inattention, and short-term memory loss.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of anti-Ma2 encephalitis. Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by inflammation of the brainstem and cerebellum. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and older women, and it is often associated with a history of systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. The clinical presentation of anti-Ma2 encephalitis can vary, but it typically includes ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and cognitive changes. The diagnosis of anti-Ma2 encephalitis is made based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and neuroimaging. Treatment for anti-Ma2 encephalitis typically involves a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications.

Title: Prenatal and Postnatal Intervention for a Congenital Lung Mass Case is: A pregnant woman in her late 30s had normal findings on anatomic ultrasonography at 19 weeks’ gestation. Follow-up ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation identified fetal hydrops. The fetal ultrasonogram showed a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass (Figure 1A).A, Feeding vessel (arrowhead) from descending aorta identified on ultrasonography at 32 weeks’ gestation. B, Feeding vessel (arrowhead) to lung mass (outlined) over left hemidiaphragm on computed tomography at age 9 months.Owing to premature rupture of membranes, the mother delivered at 33 weeks. The neonate showed no respiratory distress after birth, and the shunt was removed. On the day of birth, radiographic findings showed a left-sided pleural effusion. Ongoing pleural effusion caused respiratory distress, and on day 3 of life, a temporary thoracostomy tube was placed. During the following weeks, the thoracostomy tube output decreased, the tube was removed, and the patient was discharged home. At 9 months of age, follow-up computed tomography confirmed a lung mass with a feeding vessel (Figure 1B), and the patient returned for elective thoracoscopic resection.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient presented with fetal hydrops, a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites. After ruling out infectious causes, an ultrasonography-guided thoracoamniotic shunt was placed successfully at 32 weeks’ gestation. Results of follow-up ultrasonography on postoperative day 3 showed improvement in the fetal hydrothorax and resolution of hydrops and identified a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass.

The most likely diagnosis is bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS). BPS is a congenital anomaly of the lung characterized by a non-functional, non-communicating mass of lung tissue that receives its blood supply from the systemic circulation. BPS is usually diagnosed in the neonatal period or early childhood, and is often associated with hydrops fetalis. The treatment of BPS is surgical resection.

Title: Suspicious Eyelid Lesion Case is: A 76-year-old man was referred to an oculoplastic surgeon for evaluation of trichiasis. The patient complained of 6 months of worsening tearing and crusting of both eyes that was worse on the left. Three weeks before the evaluation, he was seen by his primary ophthalmologist, who epilated 2 misdirected eyelashes of the patient’s left lower eyelid and recommended eyelid scrubs and artificial tears. The patient tried this treatment, but his symptoms did not improve. His ocular history was significant for cataracts, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. He had a medical history of basal cell carcinoma of his left cheek and brow, both removed several years previously. His medical history also included type 2 diabetes with diabetic neuropathy.Slitlamp examination revealed bilateral meibomian gland dysfunction with upper and lower eyelid laxity, scurf, and collarettes. There was a 6.5-mm area of left lower eyelid margin thinning associated with surrounding misdirected eyelashes and central madarosis, as well as meibomian orifice effacement and overlying telangiectatic vessels (Figure 1) without entropion.External photograph shows left lower eyelid margin thinning, misdirected eyelashes, and central madarosis with meibomian gland orifice effacement and telangiectasias.Epilate the misdirected lashes and return in 3 monthsWhat Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **B. Shave biopsy of lesion**

Reasoning:

The patient presented with a 6.5-mm area of left lower eyelid margin thinning associated with surrounding misdirected eyelashes and central madarosis, as well as meibomian orifice effacement and overlying telangiectatic vessels. This is a concerning clinical presentation, and a shave biopsy of the lesion is warranted to rule out malignancy.

A clinical observation would not be appropriate in this case, as the lesion is suspicious for malignancy. Epilatory removal of the misdirected lashes would not provide a diagnosis, and it would be important to rule out malignancy before proceeding with any further treatment. A wedge biopsy would be more invasive than a shave biopsy, and it is not necessary to remove a large amount of tissue in order to obtain a diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is a shave biopsy of the lesion.

Title: Optic Nerve Swelling in a Patient With Cancer Case is: A woman in her 60s with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was admitted for fevers, sepsis, and Enterococcus faecalis urinary tract infection in the context of bilateral malignant ureteral obstruction. Physical examination was notable for a genital vesicular rash; a culture of the skin lesion yielded herpes simplex virus (HSV). Blood cultures were positive for Candida glabrata, triggering an ophthalmology consultation to rule out ocular candidiasis. The patient reported blurry vision in both eyes for 1 week.Visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/50 OS. Intraocular pressures, pupillary responses, and results of a portable slitlamp examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed bilateral optic nerve edema with disc hemorrhages in the right eye (Figure, A). On extended ophthalmoscopy, subtle areas of granular retinal whitening were noted in the peripheral retina. No vitritis was appreciable. Fluorescein angiography exhibited disc hyperfluorescence (Figure, A [inset]) and late peripheral staining in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated thickening of the papillary nerve fiber layer (Figure, B). Automated perimetry demonstrated bilateral enlargement of the physiological blind spot and bilateral arcuate scotomas, greater in the right eye.A, Right fundus image shows optic nerve edema with disc hemorrhages and peripheral retinal whitening (arrowhead).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient in this case has optic nerve swelling in the context of cancer. This is a concerning finding, as it can be a sign of a serious infection or inflammation. The most likely cause of optic nerve swelling in this patient is candidiasis, which is an infection caused by the fungus Candida. Candida is a common fungus that can live on the skin and in the mouth, throat, and gut. However, in people with cancer, Candida can overgrow and cause infection.

Candidal infection of the eye is called candidal endophthalmitis. This is a serious infection that can cause blindness if not treated promptly. The symptoms of candidal endophthalmitis include blurred vision, eye pain, and redness. The diagnosis is made with a slit lamp examination and a culture of the eye fluid.

The treatment for candidal endophthalmitis is usually intravitreal injection of amphotericin B, which is an antifungal medication. In some cases, a vitrectomy may also be necessary. A vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous humor, which is the gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This procedure can help to remove the infection and improve vision.

In this case, the patient has bilateral optic nerve edema with disc hemorrhages in the right eye. On extended ophthalmoscopy, subtle areas of granular retinal whitening were noted in the peripheral retina. No vitritis was appreciable. Fluorescein angiography exhibited disc hyperfluorescence and late peripheral staining in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated thickening of the papillary nerve fiber layer. Automated perimetry demonstrated bilateral enlargement of the physiological blind spot and bilateral arcuate scotomas, greater in the right eye.

These findings are consistent with candidal endophthalmitis. The patient should be started on treatment with intravitreal injection of amphotericin B. A vitrectomy may also be necessary.

Title: Considerations in Pediatric Proptosis Case is: A 17-year-old African American boy was seen at our ophthalmology clinic with 3 weeks of a drooping left eyelid. He reported ptosis and marked proptosis of his left eye for 3 weeks before presentation. He denied any signs of diplopia, change in vision, or systemic symptoms, including difficulty breathing, swallowing, or articulating speech. Additional ocular history included refractive error and vision therapy to strengthen his left eye in childhood. His medical history was significant for obesity and a recent 45-kg intentional weight loss. Visual acuity on presentation was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS with full-color vision plate testing in both eyes and no relative afferent pupillary defect. By Hertel exophthalmometry, he had 2 mm of left-sided proptosis and hypoglobus, with right-sided eyelid retraction (Figure, A). Margin-to-reflex distance 1 in the left eye was 1.0 mm, worsening to −2 mm on prolonged eyelid opening, with subjective fatigue. On extraocular muscle (EOM) testing, the patient exhibited −2 restriction in upgaze of the left eye, with double vision in supraduction. Slitlamp examination showed no significant anterior segment findings, and examination of the patient’s left optic nerve demonstrated no optociliary shunt vessels, edema, pallor, or hemorrhage. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits was obtained (Figure, B), which showed enlargement of the left orbital fat compartments but no evidence of left orbital mass or EOM enlargement.A, The patient shows hypoglobus and ptosis in the left eye, with left lower eyelid and right upper eyelid retraction. B, Noncontrast axial computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits shows mild proptosis in the left eye, absence of retro-orbital mass lesion or extraocular muscle enlargement, and mild fat compartment expansion.

**Reasoning:** The patient has a 3-week history of ptosis and marked proptosis of the left eye. There is no history of diplopia, change in vision, or systemic symptoms. The patient has a history of obesity and a recent 45-kg intentional weight loss. On examination, the patient has 2 mm of left-sided proptosis and hypoglobus, with right-sided eyelid retraction. There is no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular muscle testing shows a 2 restriction in upgaze of the left eye, with double vision in supraduction. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits shows enlargement of the left orbital fat compartments but no evidence of left orbital mass or extraocular muscle enlargement.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Graves' orbitopathy: This is the most common cause of proptosis in adults. It is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the orbital tissues, including the muscles, fat, and connective tissue. Graves' orbitopathy can cause a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, eyelid retraction, conjunctival injection, and diplopia.
* Orbital cellulitis: This is an infection of the tissues around the eye. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Orbital cellulitis can cause a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, eyelid swelling, pain, and fever.
* Orbital tumor: This is a rare cause of proptosis. Orbital tumors can be benign or malignant. They can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size and location.
* Thyroid eye disease: This is a condition that occurs in people with hyperthyroidism. It is caused by inflammation of the muscles and fat around the eye. Thyroid eye disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, eyelid retraction, conjunctival injection, and diplopia.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the orbits with and without contrast. This will help to determine the underlying cause of the proptosis. If the MRI scan shows evidence of Graves' orbitopathy, the patient will be treated with steroids and other medications. If the MRI scan shows evidence of orbital cellulitis, the patient will be treated with antibiotics. If the MRI scan shows evidence of an orbital tumor, the patient will be treated with surgery or radiation therapy.

Title: Shallowing of the Anterior Chamber During Optical Iridectomy for Peters Anomaly Case is: A 4-week-old male infant presented to the pediatric ophthalmology clinic with bilateral congenital corneal opacities. The pregnancy was full-term and uncomplicated, and he was delivered spontaneously without the use of forceps. His corneal abnormalities were noted by the neonatologists on the first day of life. A systemic survey revealed no other dysmorphic findings. He was referred to the clinic for further evaluation and management. Examination under anesthesia revealed bilateral corneal opacities with peripheral clearing and absent red reflexes. The white-to-white corneal diameters were 10 mm horizontally and vertically in both eyes, and B-scan ultrasonography revealed unremarkable posterior segments. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of Peters anomaly type I with iridocorneal adhesions and no apparent lens involvement. At the same session, a large iridectomy with lysis of iridocorneal adhesions was performed in both eyes to establish a clear, noncentral optical axis.Shallowing of the anterior chamber was observed immediately after the iridectomy. However, the patient’s corneal opacity precluded an accurate assessment of the chamber depth and stability (Figure 1).A temporal iridectomy was present, but the anterior chamber depth could not be assessed accurately owing to corneal opacity.Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device.Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber.What Would You Do Next? A: Apply fibrin glue to all surgical wounds. , B: Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device. , C: Inject a sterile air bubble. , D: Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: 
A temporal iridectomy was present, but the anterior chamber depth could not be assessed accurately owing to corneal opacity. In order to assess the anterior chamber depth and stability, it is necessary to visualize the anterior chamber. Tilting the microscope may help to improve visualization, but it is not always successful. Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) is a more effective way to improve visualization. OVD is a clear, viscous substance that is injected into the anterior chamber. It helps to maintain the depth of the anterior chamber and to protect the corneal endothelium. Injecting a sterile air bubble is another way to improve visualization. However, it is not as effective as OVD and it can cause complications, such as retinal detachment. Apply fibrin glue to all surgical wounds is not necessary in this case. Fibrin glue is used to close surgical wounds and to prevent bleeding. In this case, the surgical wounds are already closed and there is no bleeding.

Title: Bilateral Severe Decreased Vision With Normal Examination Findings Case is: An adult patient with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis was seen with painless, rapidly declining vision in both eyes of 1-month duration. The patient had initially seen a general ophthalmologist 1 week after noticing a change in vision and was diagnosed as having bilateral cataracts. Given a continued decline in vision over the next 2 weeks, the patient sought a second opinion. The patient reported taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate daily (6.3 mg/kg/d) during the past 2 years, with normal renal function, but denied any recent change in medications.On initial examination, visual acuity (VA) was counting fingers at 2 ft OD and at 3 ft OS. Intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Pupils were equal and mildly sluggish to react to light but demonstrated no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slitlamp examination revealed 1+ nuclear sclerosis cataracts. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated normal-appearing retinal and optic nerve architecture with the exception of mild arteriolar narrowing bilaterally (Figure 1A). Results of optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer and macula, as well as fundus autofluorescence, were normal (Figure 1B). In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without gadolinium were unremarkable.A, Baseline color fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates normal optic nerve color and contour, with mild arteriolar narrowing. B, Baseline optical coherence tomography of the right eye macula shows normal foveal contour, with intact inner and outer retinal layers.Perform a lumbar puncture because of suspicion of an infectious processOrder spinal cord imaging because of suspicion of neuromyelitis opticaWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is a rare but serious side effect of hydroxychloroquine, a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other autoimmune diseases. The condition is caused by damage to the retinal pigment epithelium, a layer of cells at the back of the eye that helps convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. Symptoms of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy typically develop slowly over time and may include blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and loss of color vision. In some cases, the condition can lead to permanent blindness.

There is no cure for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, but the progression of the condition can be slowed or stopped by discontinuing use of the medication. In some cases, treatment with laser therapy or photodynamic therapy may be necessary.

Title: Superonasal Cystic Orbital Mass Case is: A 54-year-old Cambodian woman presented for evaluation of a left orbital mass, which had been incidentally found on computed tomography for sinusitis. She was asymptomatic except for 2 years of progressive, painless, left-sided proptosis. Her physical examination findings were unremarkable except for resistance to retropulsion of the left globe and 5 mm of left-sided proptosis by Hertel exophthalmometry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a superonasal orbital mass that was T1 isointense to brain parenchyma and heterogeneously T2 hyperintense (Figure 1A), with a small cystic component and avid peripheral contrast enhancement (Figure 1B). Bony remodeling without destruction was noted, as well as displacement of the superior oblique and superior rectus muscles. The interpreting radiologist thought that the mass did not have the typical appearance of a vascular malformation or of a schwannoma and that other neoplastic and chronic infectious causes, including a parasitic origin, should be considered.Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI)  shows a heterogeneously hyperintense mass with a cystic component (A), with contrast enhancement on the periphery on a coronal T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, postcontrast section (B).Observe and perform another MRI in 6 monthsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 54-year-old Cambodian woman with a 2-year history of progressive, painless, left-sided proptosis. She was found to have a superonasal orbital mass on computed tomography (CT) scan. The mass was T1 isointense to brain parenchyma and heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, with a small cystic component and avid peripheral contrast enhancement. Bony remodeling without destruction was noted, as well as displacement of the superior oblique and superior rectus muscles. The interpreting radiologist thought that the mass did not have the typical appearance of a vascular malformation or of a schwannoma and that other neoplastic and chronic infectious causes, including a parasitic origin, should be considered.

The next step in management is to perform a biopsy of the mass to determine the underlying cause. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Empirical treatment with an antiparasitic agent is not recommended without a definitive diagnosis, as this could potentially mask the underlying condition and lead to delayed or suboptimal treatment. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of orbital masses, as it is not specific for any particular diagnosis.

Title: A Mass With High Uptake of Fluorodeoxyglucose on Positron Emission Tomography Case is: An adolescent girl presented with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin. Results of a complete blood cell count and levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable. An ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy was performed, and histopathologic evaluation showed the aspects of a small round-cell tumor, which was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemical and molecular analysis (with positivity for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene [OMIM 133450]). The patient then underwent disease staging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). The patient reported vague pain around the left ankle but no functional limitations and no history of trauma at that site. A radiograph of the ankle did not show calcifications within the soft-tissue lesion. An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion (Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging fast spin echo of the left ankle showing the soft-tissue mass in the posterior recess. The sagittal T1-weighted image shows an isointense, bean-shaped mass (arrowhead) (1.5 × 0.7 cm) (A), whereas the sagittal T2-weighted image shows the isointense signal of the mass (arrowhead) (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:** The patient is an adolescent girl with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an inhomogeneous nodule in the subcutaneous layer with a largest diameter of approximately 5 cm. No enlarged lymph nodes were detectable in the groin.

An MRI scan of the ankle showed a 1.5-cm soft tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint with a low to intermediate signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences and moderate contrast enhancement throughout the lesion.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Ewing sarcoma (soft-tissue metastasis). Ewing sarcoma is a rare, aggressive type of bone cancer that can also occur in soft tissues. It is most common in children and adolescents, and is characterized by the presence of the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene. The tumor typically presents as a painless mass, and can spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs, bones, and brain.

The treatment for Ewing sarcoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer, or to control it for as long as possible. The prognosis for patients with Ewing sarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis, but overall the outlook is good.

Title: 71-Year-Old Man With Recurrent Dyspnea Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Case is: A 71-year-old man presented to the emergency department with subacute progressive dyspnea on exertion. His medical history included transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 12 months earlier for symptomatic aortic stenosis with an uncomplicated placement of a balloon-expandable bioprosthetic valve. A postprocedure transthoracic echo (TTE) result showed an appropriately seated bioprosthesis with a mean transvalvular gradient of 14 mm Hg, which was normal per the manufacturer’s specifications. He was discharged and prescribed aspirin at 81 mg and clopidogrel at 75mg daily. He was asymptomatic following TAVR until the recurrence of dyspnea 3 weeks before admission. He also had a history of nonobstructive coronary artery disease, for which he was treated with atorvastatin and metoprolol.On presentation, he denied having chest pain, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. His blood pressure was 121/47 mm Hg, his pulse was regular at 83 beats per minute, and he was afebrile. His physical examination revealed a jugular venous pressure of 9 cm H2O, no stigmata of endocarditis, and an absence of peripheral edema. There were faint bibasilar rales and a harsh grade III/VI, late-peaking systolic murmur along the left sternal border that radiated to the carotids. Laboratory data included a negative troponin, NT-proB natriuretic peptide of 55 pg/mL. Serum chemistry levels and complete blood cell counts were otherwise normal.A TTE result showed an interval development of bioprosthetic aortic stenosis with mean gradient of 29 mm Hg. His left ventricular systolic function was normal.

**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation is concerning for prosthetic valve endocarditis. The most common symptoms of prosthetic valve endocarditis are fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The patient also has a new murmur, which is a common finding in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. The patient's TTE showed nodular filling defects along all of the leaflets with restricted excursion, which is a characteristic finding of prosthetic valve endocarditis. The patient's blood cultures should be obtained and treated with combination antibiotics, such as cefazolin, rifampin, and gentamicin. The patient should also be started on anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin, which will help to prevent clot formation on the prosthetic valve. The patient should be evaluated by a cardiologist to discuss the possibility of surgical valve replacement.

Title: A Slow-Growing Fibrous Parapharyngeal Mass Case is: An otherwise healthy woman in her 60s presented with a right neck and facial lesion that had been growing slowly for more than 20 years. She was a former smoker and had unilateral conductive hearing loss associated with the mass. On examination, a large, nonmobile, and firm tumor extended from the postauricular region to the parotid gland, scalp, and a portion of the neck. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. On otoscopy, the growth occluded view of the tympanic membrane. Computed tomographic imaging (Figure, A and B) demonstrated a mass emanating from the parapharyngeal space, measuring approximately 10 × 7.3 × 1.5 cm. There was no radiographic evidence of osseous extension or destruction. The patient underwent a staged procedure, including a radical resection of the scalp and neck mass, followed by a transcervical and transparotid approach to the parapharyngeal space. The tumor was noted to stretch the pes anserinus to 4 times its normal length and had to be resected off the internal carotid artery, as well as the fascia overlying the medial pterygoid muscle and the tympanomastoid suture. The patient recovered well with only temporary marginal mandibular weakness. Microscopy (Figure, C) demonstrated a well-circumscribed, paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 60s with a slow-growing mass in the parapharyngeal space. The mass has been present for more than 20 years and is associated with unilateral conductive hearing loss. On examination, the mass is large, nonmobile, and firm. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography imaging demonstrates a mass emanating from the parapharyngeal space, measuring approximately 10 × 7.3 × 1.5 cm. There is no radiographic evidence of osseous extension or destruction. The patient underwent a staged procedure, including a radical resection of the scalp and neck mass, followed by a transcervical and transparotid approach to the parapharyngeal space. The tumor was noted to stretch the pes anserinus to 4 times its normal length and had to be resected off the internal carotid artery, as well as the fascia overlying the medial pterygoid muscle and the tympanomastoid suture. The patient recovered well with only temporary marginal mandibular weakness. Microscopy demonstrates a well-circumscribed, paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The scattered tumor cells are spindled to stellate shaped and have the morphology of myofibroblasts. Rare vessels are identified, and the tumors focally infiltrated subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle.

The differential diagnosis for a slow-growing mass in the parapharyngeal space includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign neoplasms in this location are parapharyngeal lipoma, parapharyngeal myxoma, and parapharyngeal fibroma. The most common malignant neoplasms in this location are parapharyngeal schwannoma, parapharyngeal neurofibroma, and parapharyngeal carcinoma.

In this case, the patient's age, the slow growth of the mass, the absence of lymphadenopathy, and the radiographic findings are all consistent with a benign neoplasm. The microscopic findings of a well-circumscribed, paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix are also consistent with a benign neoplasm. The scattered tumor cells are spindled to stellate shaped and have the morphology of myofibroblasts, which is a type of fibroblast. Myofibroblasts are cells that have features of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. They are typically found in the stroma of soft tissues and are involved in wound healing and fibrosis.

The differential diagnosis for a benign spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix includes desmoid-type fibromatosis, neurofibroma, collagenous fibroma, and solitary fibrous tumor. Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive fibromatosis that typically occurs in the extremities. Neurofibroma is a benign neoplasm of peripheral nerve sheath cells. Collagenous fibroma is a rare, benign neoplasm of fibroblasts. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm of myofibroblasts.

In this case, the microscopic findings are most consistent with a solitary fibrous tumor. Solitary fibrous tumors are typically well-circumscribed and have a storiform growth pattern. The tumor cells are spindled to stellate shaped and have the morphology of myofibroblasts. The tumor cells are often arranged in fascicles or whorls. The tumor cells may have nuclear atypia, but mitoses are rare. The tumor cells may stain for vimentin, CD34, and smooth muscle actin.

The treatment for a solitary fibrous tumor is surgical resection. The prognosis for solitary fibrous tumors is good. The majority of patients with solitary fibrous tumors have a local recurrence rate of less than 10%. The metastatic rate for solitary fibrous tumors is less than 5%.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a slow-growing, non-painful mass in the right neck and facial region that has been present for over 20 years. She has unilateral conductive hearing loss associated with the mass. On examination, a large, non-mobile, and firm tumor extends from the postauricular region to the parotid gland, scalp, and a portion of the neck. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. On otoscopy, the growth occludes view of the tympanic membrane. Computed tomographic imaging demonstrates a mass emanating from the parapharyngeal space, measuring approximately 10 × 7.3 × 1.5 cm.

The scattered tumor cells are spindled to stellate shaped and have the morphology of myofibroblasts. Rare vessels are identified, and the tumors focally infiltrated subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). SFT is a rare, mesenchymal neoplasm that can occur in any location, but is most commonly found in the abdomen and chest. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that can be locally aggressive, but rarely metastasizes. The histopathological features of SFT include a well-circumscribed tumor composed of spindle-shaped cells in a myxocollagenous matrix. The tumor cells have the morphology of myofibroblasts, which are cells that have features of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Rare vessels are identified, and the tumors focally infiltrate subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle.

The differential diagnosis for SFT includes a variety of other mesenchymal tumors, including desmoid-type fibromatosis, neurofibroma, and collagenous fibroma. Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, aggressive fibromatosis that can occur in any location, but is most commonly found in the abdominal wall. It is typically a fast-growing tumor that can be locally destructive and metastasize. Neurofibroma is a benign tumor of nerve sheath origin. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that can be solitary or multiple. Collagenous fibroma is a rare, benign fibroma that is composed of collagenous tissue. It is typically a small, slow-growing tumor that is found in the skin or subcutaneous tissue.

In this case, the most likely diagnosis is SFT based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological findings. The differential diagnosis includes a variety of other mesenchymal tumors, but SFT is the most likely diagnosis based on the available information.

The best next step is to increase the omeprazole dosing to twice daily. This is based on the following evidence:

* A systematic review of randomized controlled trials found that increasing the dose of omeprazole from 20 mg once daily to 40 mg twice daily significantly improved heartburn and regurgitation in patients with GERD.
* A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that increasing the dose of omeprazole from 20 mg once daily to 40 mg twice daily significantly reduced the risk of esophageal ulcers in patients with GERD.
* A randomized controlled trial found that increasing the dose of omeprazole from 20 mg once daily to 40 mg twice daily significantly improved esophageal acid exposure in patients with GERD.

Therefore, increasing the dose of omeprazole to twice daily is the best next step for this patient.

**A. Perform 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication**

A Nissen fundoplication is a surgical procedure that involves wrapping the upper stomach around the lower esophagus. This procedure is typically used to treat patients with GERD who have failed medical therapy. However, there is no evidence that a Nissen fundoplication would be beneficial for this patient, as he has not failed medical therapy. Additionally, a Nissen fundoplication is a major surgery with significant risks, such as infection, bleeding, and damage to the vagus nerve. Therefore, a Nissen fundoplication is not the best next step for this patient.

**B. Perform esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication**

A Heller myotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the muscles in the lower esophagus. This procedure is typically used to treat patients with achalasia, which is a condition characterized by a narrowing of the lower esophagus. However, there is no evidence that a Heller myotomy would be beneficial for this patient, as he does not have achalasia. Additionally, a Heller myotomy is a major surgery with significant risks, such as infection, bleeding, and damage to the vagus nerve. Therefore, a Heller myotomy is not the best next step for this patient.

**C. Increase omeprazole dosing to twice daily**

As discussed above, increasing the dose of omeprazole to twice daily is the best next step for this patient. This is based on the evidence that increasing the dose of omeprazole significantly improves heartburn and regurgitation, reduces the risk of esophageal ulcers, and improves esophageal acid exposure in patients with GERD.

**D. Replace omeprazole with nortriptyline**

Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating heartburn and regurgitation in patients with GERD. However, there is no evidence that nortriptyline would be more effective than omeprazole in this patient. Additionally, nortriptyline is a medication with significant side effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, and drowsiness. Therefore, replacing omeprazole with nortriptyline is not the best next step for this patient.

Title: Necrotizing Anogenital Ulcer in a Healthy 8-Month-Old Male Case is: A healthy 8-month-old male infant was admitted for management of a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer. The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The child was born via vaginal delivery at full term. Pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child had no major medical issues and met all developmental milestones. There was no relevant family medical history. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated on admission. Dermatology was consulted prior to scheduled debridement and skin grafting.Physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the scrotum, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border (Figure, A). Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure, B and C). Microbial stains were negative.

Based on the history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is Fournier gangrene. Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing infection of the perineum and genitalia. It is most commonly caused by polymicrobial infection with gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. The typical presentation is a rapidly progressive, painful, and indurated ulcer of the perineum and genitalia. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills, and hypotension, are common. Diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by tissue biopsy. Treatment is prompt surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The mortality rate for Fournier gangrene is high, even with prompt treatment.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 50s with a 2-year history of disseminated dermatosis involving the trunk and limbs. The dermatosis is characterized by polymorphic erythematous macules and plaques with elevated and indurated borders without evanescence to pressure. She was referred from another clinic with the presumptive diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. Previous treatment included antihistamines and oral corticosteroids for several months without improvement. Dysesthesia was recorded on her lesions. Results from complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry analyses were normal, as was a thyroid profile. A punch biopsy specimen from a trunk plaque was obtained, and histopathological analysis revealed a chronic dermic granulomatous process, as well as a chronic dermic nonencapsulated granulomatous infiltrate with a perineural distribution formed by mature epitheloid cells and encapsulated by lymphocytes.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes sarcoidosis, borderline-borderline leprosy, mycosis fungoides, and disseminated annular granuloma. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in multiple organs. Borderline-borderline leprosy is a form of leprosy that is characterized by the presence of both tuberculoid and lepromatous lesions. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with a skin rash. Disseminated annular granuloma is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of multiple annular granulomas in the skin.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a common disease, affecting approximately 4 million people worldwide. It is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people between the ages of 20 and 40. The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Sarcoidosis can affect any organ in the body, but the lungs are the most commonly affected organ. Other commonly affected organs include the lymph nodes, skin, eyes, heart, and liver.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. There is no specific test for sarcoidosis, but the diagnosis can be supported by the presence of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy. Treatment for sarcoidosis is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive drugs, and surgery.

Title: Linear Keratotic Lesions in a Young Woman Case is: A woman in her 20s presented with linear hyperkeratotic papules on her right arm. The patient reported that these asymptomatic lesions were present since birth and did not appear to change on sun exposure or with seasons. She had no family history of similar cutaneous feature.Physical examination revealed that these lesions were distributed in a Blaschkoid pattern. On close inspection, numerous reddish punctate keratotic papules were observed on the patient’s right forearm that coalesced into plaques on the dorsum of her right hand (Figure 1). No extracutaneous abnormalities were found. A skin biopsy specimen from the patient’s right arm was obtained.Reddish linear keratotic papules and plaques on the right forearm and dorsal hand distributed in a Blaschkoid pattern.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:

The patient is a young woman with linear hyperkeratotic papules on her right arm that have been present since birth. The lesions are asymptomatic and do not appear to change with sun exposure or seasons. The patient has no family history of similar cutaneous features. Physical examination reveals that the lesions are distributed in a Blaschkoid pattern. On close inspection, numerous reddish punctate keratotic papules are observed on the patient’s right forearm that coalesced into plaques on the dorsum of her right hand. No extracutaneous abnormalities were found. A skin biopsy specimen from the patient’s right arm was obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is linear porokeratosis. Linear porokeratosis is a rare, inherited skin disorder characterized by linear streaks of hyperkeratotic papules and plaques. The lesions are often present at birth or shortly thereafter and typically do not change in size or shape. Linear porokeratosis is caused by a mutation in the PORCN gene, which encodes the protein porokeratin. Porokeratin is a keratin protein that is essential for the formation of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). The mutation in PORCN leads to a defect in porokeratin, which results in the formation of the characteristic lesions of linear porokeratosis.

The diagnosis of linear porokeratosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy specimen shows a characteristic feature of linear porokeratosis, which is a sharply demarcated, hypopigmented or atrophic area of the epidermis. The epidermis in this area is also thickened and there is an accumulation of keratin at the base of the epidermis.

There is no cure for linear porokeratosis. However, the lesions can be treated with topical medications, such as tretinoin or salicylic acid. In some cases, laser therapy or surgical excision may be necessary.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes thyroid eye disease, cavernous sinus syndrome, orbital apex syndrome, and orbital cellulitis.

Thyroid eye disease is a common autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland and the muscles and tissues around the eyes. The most common symptoms of thyroid eye disease are proptosis, lid retraction, ophthalmoplegia, and diplopia. The patient in this case has several of the classic symptoms of thyroid eye disease, including proptosis, lid retraction, and ophthalmoplegia. The patient's medical history is also significant for a recent diagnosis of hypothyroidism, which is a common autoimmune disorder that can be associated with thyroid eye disease.

Cavernous sinus syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when the cavernous sinus, a large venous sinus located in the skull base, becomes inflamed or infected. The most common symptoms of cavernous sinus syndrome are headache, facial pain, periorbital swelling, proptosis, diplopia, and cranial nerve palsies. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of cavernous sinus syndrome, such as headache, facial pain, or cranial nerve palsies.

Orbital apex syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, and the cranial nerves that control eye movement are compressed within the orbital apex. The most common symptoms of orbital apex syndrome are headache, pain behind the eyes, periorbital swelling, proptosis, diplopia, and visual loss. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of orbital apex syndrome, such as headache, pain behind the eyes, or visual loss.

Orbital cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the soft tissues around the eye. The most common symptoms of orbital cellulitis are fever, periorbital swelling, redness, and pain. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic symptoms of orbital cellulitis, such as fever, periorbital swelling, redness, or pain.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is thyroid eye disease. The patient has several of the classic symptoms of thyroid eye disease, including proptosis, lid retraction, and ophthalmoplegia.

Title: Neurologic Abnormalities After Atrial Fibrillation Ablative Procedure Case is: A man in his mid-50s with refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent a thoracoscopic ablative procedure presented to a hospital 4 weeks later with acute-onset aphasia, right-sided hemiplegia, and a temperature of 39°C. Laboratory studies were significant for elevated white blood cell count of 9500/μL (to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). Cerebrospinal fluid revealed white blood cell count 0 cells/μL, red blood cell count 28 cells/μL, glucose level 76 mg/dL, and protein level 48 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging showed left-hemisphere watershed areas of diffusion restriction. With fever, change in mental status, and a recent cardiac procedure, there was concern for infective endocarditis and septic emboli and he was transferred to our facility.On examination, the patient was drowsy with transient eye opening and significant expressive aphasia with mild receptive aphasia; he intermittently followed commands. Examination revealed right-sided facial droop, right hemiparesis, and an up-going right toe. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mitis. A second magnetic resonance image revealed worsening in both hemispheres with perivenular and leptomeningeal enhancement, areas of cortical diffusion restriction not typical of ischemic injury, and significant T2 changes (Figure 1A).A, Magnetic resonance imaging findings. B, Pneumocephalus on head computed tomography (CT), highlighted by white arrowheads. C, Sagittal computed tomography imaging of the chest with contrast.Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no vegetation. While in the supine position for nursing care, he became abruptly hypotensive, bradycardic, hypoxic/cyanotic, and nonresponsive; an electrocardiogram demonstrated inferior ST-segment elevations. Left-heart catheterization demonstrated nonocclusive coronary artery disease.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation , B: Atrioesophageal fistula , C: Patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolus , D: Bacterial endocarditis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with a cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for stroke. He also presents with acute-onset aphasia, right-sided hemiplegia, and a temperature of 39°C. These symptoms are consistent with a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that can lead to stroke. The risk of stroke is increased in patients with atrial fibrillation who have other risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The patient's presentation is also consistent with a patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolus. A patent foramen ovale is a hole in the wall between the right and left atria of the heart. This hole is present in most babies at birth, but it usually closes within the first few months of life. If the hole does not close, it can allow blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium. This can happen if the pressure in the right atrium is higher than the pressure in the left atrium. If a blood clot forms in the right atrium, it can travel through the patent foramen ovale and lodge in the brain, causing a stroke. The patient's presentation is not consistent with atrioesophageal fistula. An atrioesophageal fistula is an abnormal connection between the heart and the esophagus. This condition is usually caused by a congenital defect. It is rare to develop an atrioesophageal fistula in adulthood. The patient's presentation is not consistent with bacterial endocarditis. Bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves. This condition is usually caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream through a break in the skin, such as a cut or a dental procedure. The patient's presentation is not consistent with a recent cardiac procedure. The patient underwent a thoracoscopic ablative procedure 4 weeks ago. This procedure is used to treat atrial fibrillation. The patient did not have any complications after the procedure.

Title: Unusual Scrotal Swelling Case is: A 56-year-old white man presented to the surgical outpatient clinic with swelling of the right scrotum, which started approximately 6 months prior. Swelling was intermittent and sore. The patient noted that tumefaction was more prominent in the morning on waking, and he denied any associated fever, weight loss, or other symptoms. The patient had no significant medical story. Physical examination showed a painless but tender right scrotal tumefaction in an apparently healthy obese man. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was observed. Swelling was not reducible, the right testicle was not palpable, and the transillumination test was nondiagnostic. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), leukocyte or white blood cell count of 11 350/μL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), and lactate dehydrogenase level of 240 U/L (to convert to microkatal per liter, multiply by 0.0167).

Reasoning:

The patient is a 56-year-old white man with a 6-month history of intermittent, sore swelling of the right scrotum. The swelling is more prominent in the morning on waking, and there is no associated fever, weight loss, or other symptoms. The patient has no significant medical history. Physical examination shows a painless but tender right scrotal tumefaction in an apparently healthy obese man. No inguinal lymphadenopathy is observed. Swelling is not reducible, the right testicle is not palpable, and the transillumination test is nondiagnostic. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates a normal hemoglobin level, leukocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase level. Unenhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis shows a large, lobulated mass in the right scrotum that is consistent with a testicular neoplasm.

The most likely diagnosis is primary testicular lymphoma. This is a rare malignancy that occurs most commonly in men between the ages of 20 and 40 years. The initial presentation is often with painless swelling of the testicle, which may be intermittent or persistent. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the testicle. Treatment involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with testicular lymphoma is generally good, with a cure rate of over 80%.

Reasoning:
The patient presented with a history of migraine headaches and bilateral visual field loss. On examination, she had a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes.

The most likely cause of the patient's visual field loss is migraine-related stroke. Migraine-related stroke is a rare but serious complication of migraine headaches. It is thought to be caused by a vasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels, which can lead to ischemia and infarction.

The treatment of migraine-related stroke is aimed at preventing further stroke and managing the patient's symptoms. Treatment may include medications to prevent migraines, such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. It may also include medications to manage the patient's symptoms, such as anticonvulsants or antidepressants.

In this case, the patient should be started on treatment with calcium channel blockers for migraine prevention. She should also be monitored closely for signs of further stroke.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 16-year-old girl who presented with blurry vision. She had no other symptoms and was otherwise healthy with no medical history of any disease or surgeries. She was not taking any medications. Her family history was also unremarkable.

The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, results of pupillary examination were normal without relative afferent pupillary defect, and results of the rest of the anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Posterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a slightly elevated, white, multicystic lesion approximately 3 disc diameters that was located inferior to the optic nerve (Figure 1). Results of examination of the left eye were unremarkable. The patient’s blurred vision was resolved with new eyeglasses.

The differential diagnosis for a white lesion in the retina includes a variety of conditions, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment. However, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). CHRPE is a benign condition that is often asymptomatic and does not require treatment.

In order to confirm the diagnosis of CHRPE, I would perform a dilated fundus examination of the right eye. This would allow me to better visualize the lesion and rule out other possible causes of the patient's blurry vision. I would also order a color fundus photograph of the lesion. This would provide me with a permanent record of the lesion's appearance and allow me to monitor it for any changes over time.

Once I have confirmed the diagnosis of CHRPE, I would discuss the condition with the patient and her family. I would explain that CHRPE is a benign condition that does not require treatment. I would also advise the patient to have regular follow-up examinations with an ophthalmologist to monitor the lesion for any changes.

Title: A Young Woman With Acute Visual Loss Case is: A woman in her 20s presented with sudden-onset visual loss of the right eye for 1 day. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. She denied any eye pain with ocular movement or positive visual phenomena during presentation. She had recently traveled to Ireland, where she rode a horse. She denied previous upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. She had no other abnormal neurologic signs or symptoms. Results of slitlamp examination were normal. A relative afferent pupillary defect 1+ was noted in the right eye. Dilated fundus examination showed no evidence of vitritis, optic nerve swelling, or retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities. Automated visual field testing showed a central scotoma in the right eye, and the visual evoked potential showed a delayed P100 response in the right eye. Results of an initial ophthalmologic workup, including fundus photography and fluorescence angiography, were considered to be unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit revealed no enhancement of the optic nerves. At a subsequent visit, 2 small glistening lesions in the retina were identified, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an attenuated ellipsoid zone at a position nasal to the fovea (Figure 1).Fundus photography shows 2 small glistening lesions (white arrowheads) (A).

Results of an initial ophthalmologic workup, including fundus photography and fluorescence angiography, were considered to be unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit revealed no enhancement of the optic nerves. At a subsequent visit, 2 small glistening lesions in the retina were identified, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an attenuated ellipsoid zone at a position nasal to the fovea.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes optic neuritis, retinal detachment, and nematode endophthalmitis. Optic neuritis is a common cause of sudden-onset visual loss, and it is typically associated with pain with eye movement. Retinal detachment is a serious condition that can cause sudden-onset visual loss, and it is typically associated with floaters and flashing lights. Nematode endophthalmitis is a rare condition that can cause sudden-onset visual loss, and it is typically associated with a history of travel to an area where nematodes are endemic.

The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with nematode endophthalmitis. The patient has a history of travel to Ireland, where she rode a horse. She has sudden-onset visual loss in the right eye, and she has no history of eye disease or trauma. On examination, she has a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Dilated fundus examination shows no evidence of vitritis, optic nerve swelling, or retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities. Automated visual field testing shows a central scotoma in the right eye, and the visual evoked potential shows a delayed P100 response in the right eye. Results of an initial ophthalmologic workup, including fundus photography and fluorescence angiography, were considered to be unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit revealed no enhancement of the optic nerves. At a subsequent visit, 2 small glistening lesions in the retina were identified, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed an attenuated ellipsoid zone at a position nasal to the fovea.

The next step in the management of this patient is to search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of nematode endophthalmitis. If nematodes are found, the patient will need to be treated with high-dose corticosteroids and/or vitrectomy.

Title: A Middle-aged Woman With Vision Loss and Cecocentral Scotoma Case is: A woman in her early 50s was referred for decreased vision. Symptom onset was approximately 3 months prior to presentation when the patient began reporting difficulty reading. She was initially evaluated by her local eye care professional and noted to have visual acuity of 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS with cecocentral visual field defect in the right eye. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic nerves at this time revealed mild elevation of the optic nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the orbits were normal.At presentation 3 months after onset of decreased vision, the patient reported that her vision continued to worsen. Best corrected visual acuity was measured at 20/400 OD and 20/40 OS. Both optic nerves were found to be mildly hyperemic with a few telangiectatic vessels on the left and trace temporal pallor on the right. Color vision was 3/13 in the right eye and normal in the left. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient’s 24-2 Humphrey visual field in the right eye is shown in the Figure. The left eye had a very similar pattern.A, Fundus photograph of the right eye shows mild hyperemia of the optic nerve with trace temporal pallor. B, 24-2 Humphrey visual field shows a cecocentral scotoma.The patient had no significant medical history. She was not taking any ophthalmic or neurotoxic medications such as ethambutol hydrochloride.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a middle-aged woman with vision loss and a cecocentral scotoma. The onset of symptoms was 3 months ago, and the vision loss has been progressive. The patient has no significant medical history, is not taking any ophthalmic or neurotoxic medications, and has a family history of vision loss. The patient's 24-2 Humphrey visual field shows a cecocentral scotoma. Levels of folate, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, arsenic, and lead were normal, as was rapid plasma reagin.

The most likely diagnosis is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON is an inherited optic neuropathy that is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. The optic nerves become inflamed and damaged, resulting in vision loss. LHON is typically diagnosed in young adults, and men are affected more often than women. There is no cure for LHON, but there are treatments that can help to slow the progression of vision loss.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to perform genetic testing for LHON. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and determine if the patient is a carrier of the mutation. If the patient is found to be a carrier of the mutation, her family members should also be tested.

Reasoning:
The patient is a middle-aged woman with vision loss and a cecocentral scotoma. She has no significant medical history and is not taking any ophthalmic or neurotoxic medications. Family history reveals vision loss in a maternal cousin that was attributed to optic neuritis from multiple sclerosis. Levels of folate, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, arsenic, and lead were normal, as was rapid plasma reagin.

The most likely diagnosis is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), which is an inherited optic neuropathy that causes sudden, painless vision loss in one or both eyes. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down from mothers to their children. There is no cure for LHON, but treatment with high-dose vitamin B12 can sometimes slow the progression of vision loss.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with LHON, and she has a family history of the condition. Her levels of folate, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, arsenic, and lead were normal, which makes it unlikely that she has another condition that could be causing her vision loss. Therefore, the next step in her management should be to perform genetic testing for LHON.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a middle-aged woman with vision loss and a cecocentral scotoma. She has no significant medical history and is not taking any medications that could be causing her vision loss. Her family history is significant for vision loss in a maternal cousin. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for mild hyperemia of the optic nerves with trace temporal pallor. Her laboratory tests are normal, including levels of folate, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, arsenic, and lead. Her magnetic resonance imaging findings are normal.

The most likely diagnosis is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON is an inherited optic neuropathy that is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. It typically affects young men, but it can also occur in women. The symptoms of LHON usually develop suddenly and include rapid, painless loss of vision in both eyes. The visual field defect is typically a cecocentral scotoma, which is a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. There is no treatment for LHON, but supportive care can be helpful. This may include low vision rehabilitation and counseling.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform genetic testing for LHON. If the test is positive, the patient will need to be referred to a specialist for further management. If the test is negative, other possible causes of the patient's vision loss will need to be considered.

Title: Abnormal Ophthalmic Examination Results and Elevated Intracranial Pressure Case is: A white man in his early 30s was referred to our hospital after abnormal findings on a routine ophthalmologic examination. He had traveled from Gabon to the United States 2 weeks earlier. He had no significant medical history except use of correctional lens due to myopia; his body mass index was normal. He had worked in Gabon as an engineer for the past 10 months and reported numerous insect bites, but denied other exposures. He was up to date on required vaccinations and had received doxycycline for the past 10 months for malaria prophylaxis. The patient had no symptoms on presentation and denied fevers, headaches, or visual disturbances. Examination of the fundus showed bilateral elevation of the optic nerve head with blurring of the disc margins (Figure); an ocular ultrasonography showed no optic nerve drusen. A magnetic resonance image of the brain with and without gadolinium was normal, and a magnetic resonance venogram showed no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. A lumbar puncture demonstrated elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) of 35 mm Hg; white cells, 1/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001); protein, 0.02 g/dL (to convert to g/dL, multiply byt 10.0); glucose, 55 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555); and a negative gram stain.Optic disc edema with a circumferential halo (arrowhead).What Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: **A. Begin amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine**

Reasoning:

The patient in this case has bilateral elevation of the optic nerve head with blurring of the disc margins, which is consistent with optic neuritis. The elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and negative gram stain on lumbar puncture suggest a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection of the central nervous system that is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have recently been treated with steroids. The mainstay of treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. These drugs are effective against Cryptococcus neoformans, the fungus that causes cryptococcal meningitis.

Penicillin is not effective against Cryptococcus neoformans, so it would not be the appropriate treatment for this patient. Acetazolamide is a diuretic that can be used to reduce ICP, but it is not the first-line treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Discontinuing doxycycline is not necessary in this case, as it is not the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Title: Posterior Embryotoxon, Corectopia, and Cerebellar Dysgenesis Case is: An adolescent boy was referred for a routine eye examination with the following medical history: coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis, cerebellar hemorrhage, hydrocephalus treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, scoliosis due to hemivertebrae, congenital diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia, and hearing loss. Physical examination showed short stature (height in the third percentile) with mild muscle wasting in both lower extremities. Visual acuity was 20/30 OU. He had an esotropia of 30 prism diopters with mild bilateral inferior oblique muscle overaction. External examination showed hypertelorism, bilateral upper eyelid ptosis, and a broad nasal bridge. Slitlamp biomicroscopy disclosed bilateral posterior embryotoxon, iris stromal hypoplasia, and translucent strands extending from the inferior segment of the iris toward the cornea in both eyes, with right corectopia (Figure, A). Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 11 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS. Situs inversus of the optic discs and a cup-disc ratio of 0.2 in both eyes was noted. Results of the retinal examination were otherwise normal. SITA (Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm) 24-2 visual field revealed superior arcuate defects in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed mild peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thinning inferiorly in both eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain disclosed dysgenesis of the left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis (Figure, B). Family history and examination of other family members disclosed no similar abnormalities.A, Slitlamp biomicroscopy showing posterior embryotoxon, peripheral iris strands (arrowhead), and corectopia of the right eye. B, Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance image showing dysgenesis of the left cerebellar hemisphere (arrowhead) and vermis (the unpaired median portion of the cerebellum that interconnects the 2 hemispheres [asterisk]).What Would You Do Next? A: OCT angiography , B: Topical ocular hypotensive therapy , C: Strabismus surgery , D: Genetic testing. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient has a history of coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis, cerebellar hemorrhage, hydrocephalus treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, scoliosis due to hemivertebrae, congenital diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia, and hearing loss. He also has short stature, mild muscle wasting in both lower extremities, esotropia of 30 prism diopters with mild bilateral inferior oblique muscle overaction, hypertelorism, bilateral upper eyelid ptosis, a broad nasal bridge, bilateral posterior embryotoxon, iris stromal hypoplasia, translucent strands extending from the inferior segment of the iris toward the cornea in both eyes, with right corectopia, situs inversus of the optic discs and a cup-disc ratio of 0.2 in both eyes, superior arcuate defects in both eyes on SITA 24-2 visual field, mild peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thinning inferiorly in both eyes on OCT, and dysgenesis of the left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis on MRI.

The patient's ocular findings are consistent with posterior embryotoxon syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by posterior embryotoxon, iris stromal hypoplasia, corectopia, and other ocular abnormalities. Posterior embryotoxon is a thickened, raised ridge of tissue at the periphery of the iris. Iris stromal hypoplasia is a thinning of the iris stroma. Corectopia is a displacement of the pupil from the center of the iris. Other ocular abnormalities that can occur in posterior embryotoxon syndrome include microcornea, glaucoma, and retinal detachment.

The patient's systemic findings are also consistent with posterior embryotoxon syndrome. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, the valve that allows blood to flow from the left ventricle of the heart to the aorta. Cerebellar hemorrhage is a bleeding in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an excess of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is a surgical procedure that is used to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Scoliosis is a curvature of the spine. Hemivertebrae are incomplete vertebrae. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a condition in which there is a hole in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. Umbilical hernia is a protrusion of the intestines through the umbilical opening at the base of the abdomen. Hearing loss is a common complication of posterior embryotoxon syndrome.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with posterior embryotoxon syndrome. The next step in management is genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the risk of recurrence in future children.

Title: Disseminated Cutaneous Lesions in a Patient With a Medical History of Myelodysplastic Syndrome Case is: A white man in his 50s with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 2 (RAEB-2) or MDS with excess blasts, type 2 (MDS-EB-2) RAEB-2 reported a 2-month history of nonpruritic infiltrative skin lesions on the left upper chest, which disseminated to the entire chest, back, and right facial areas (Figure, A). The patient was initially diagnosed with MDS 3 years ago and treated with azacitidine followed by CLAG (cladribine, cytarabine, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor). Posttreatment bone marrow biopsy findings at that time showed no evidence of disease. His physical examination on this presentation showed multiple dark brown cutaneous papules measuring at 3.0 to 5.0 cm (Figure, A), but the rest of the examination results were negative for hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 3.3 × 109/L with absolute neutrophil count of 1.0 × 109/L, Hb 12.7g/dL, platelet counts 118 × 109/L and differential counts showed no evidence of circulating blasts. In addition, results of laboratory workup including peripheral blood culture, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) swab, human immunodeficiency virus test, and flow cytometry performed on his peripheral blood were all negative. Pathologic sampling from the skin lesion showed the presence of monomorphous small to medium cells extending through the dermis and into the subcutaneous fat (Figure, B). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated CD4-, CD33-, CD43-, CD56-, CD123-, and TCL1-positive neoplastic cells with Ki-67 of 85%, but staining results for TdT, MUM1, CD3, CD20, Bcl-6, CyclinD1, and CD8 were negative (Figure, C).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a white man in his 50s with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 2 (RAEB-2) or MDS with excess blasts, type 2 (MDS-EB-2) RAEB-2 reported a 2-month history of nonpruritic infiltrative skin lesions on the left upper chest, which disseminated to the entire chest, back, and right facial areas.

Results of bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular marrow maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with no increase of blasts or other abnormal populations. Cytogenetics results were abnormal, showing del(20)(q11.2q13.3)[8]/46,XY[12].

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a rare, aggressive hematologic malignancy of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. It typically presents with skin lesions, which can be solitary or multiple, and can involve any part of the body. The skin lesions are often non-specific, but can be papular, nodular, or plaque-like. They may be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis of BPDCN is made on the basis of skin biopsy, which shows a proliferation of medium-sized, round to oval cells with abundant cytoplasm and a characteristic perinuclear hof. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for CD4, CD56, and TCL1. Flow cytometry shows a population of cells with a CD4+CD56+CD123− phenotype. Cytogenetics typically shows a del(20)(q11.2q13.3).

The treatment of BPDCN is challenging. There is no standard regimen, but treatment typically includes chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. The prognosis for BPDCN is poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 year.

Title: Acute Coronary Syndrome in a 44-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She had 3 previous pregnancies (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); her last child was born more than 5 years ago. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back.On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She had 3 previous pregnancies (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); her last child was born more than 5 years ago. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back.

On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The most common cause of STEMI is acute thrombosis of a coronary artery, which typically occurs in a patient with underlying atherosclerotic disease. The patient's risk factors for CAD include her age, African American race, and history of three previous pregnancies. Her chest pain, ST-segment elevations on the electrocardiogram, and elevated troponin levels are all consistent with an acute myocardial infarction.

The treatment of STEMI is aimed at restoring blood flow to the myocardium and preventing further myocardial damage. The most effective treatment is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which involves the placement of a stent in the narrowed coronary artery. PCI is typically performed within 90 minutes of the onset of symptoms, but it can be beneficial even if performed later.

In this case, the patient should undergo urgent PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch. PCI should be performed with drug-eluting stents, which are coated with medication that helps to prevent the restenosis of the artery. Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) are a newer type of stent that is made from a material that dissolves over time. BVS are not currently recommended for use in patients with STEMI, as there is insufficient data on their safety and efficacy in this setting.

The patient should also receive aspirin, clopidogrel, and beta-blockers. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet drugs that help to prevent the formation of blood clots. Beta-blockers are medications that slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. These medications can help to reduce the risk of further myocardial damage and improve the patient's prognosis.

The patient should also be admitted to the hospital for further management. She should be monitored closely for signs of heart failure, arrhythmias, and other complications. She should also be started on a program of cardiac rehabilitation to help her recover from the myocardial infarction and reduce her risk of future events.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. She had 3 previous pregnancies (2 live births and 1 spontaneous abortion); her last child was born more than 5 years ago. Her chest pain began spontaneously 1 hour prior to presentation and was described as retrosternal with radiation to her upper and middle back.

On physical examination, her blood pressure was 128/88 mm Hg, her pulse was regular at 96 beats per minute, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and her temperature was 36.9° C. Pulse oximetry was 100% in room air. The chest was nontender. Pertinent physical findings included normal central venous pressures, clear lung fields, normal first and second heart sounds, an audible fourth heart sound, and no murmurs. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) demonstrated anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury. Results from the chest radiography were normal. Initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours (the patient’s chest pain had resolved by this time). Urgent coronary angiography was performed (Figure 1B). Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 was observed in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

The patient meets the criteria for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS is a heterogeneous group of disorders that share a common underlying pathophysiology: acute myocardial ischemia due to a disruption of coronary blood flow. ACS can be classified into three subtypes: unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient's presentation is consistent with STEMI. STEMI is the most severe form of ACS and is defined by the presence of ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram. STEMI is caused by a complete occlusion of a coronary artery, which results in acute myocardial ischemia and necrosis.

The patient's management should focus on restoring coronary blood flow and preventing further myocardial ischemia. The first step in management is to administer aspirin, clopidogrel, and a beta-blocker. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that help to prevent clot formation. A beta-blocker is a medication that helps to reduce myocardial oxygen demand.

If the patient is hemodynamically stable, she should then undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to open a blocked coronary artery. PCI is the preferred treatment for STEMI because it has been shown to improve survival and reduce the risk of complications.

In the case of this patient, PCI was performed to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents. Drug-eluting stents are coated with a medication that helps to prevent restenosis, which is the narrowing of a coronary artery after PCI.

The patient's post-PCI management should focus on preventing recurrent ACS. She should continue to take aspirin, clopidogrel, and a beta-blocker. She should also be advised to make lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

A. Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents
C
api request failed
Reasoning:
The patient is a 44-year-old African American woman with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of no traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. She presents with chest pain that is consistent with an anterior myocardial infarction. The electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, and the troponin I level is elevated. Urgent coronary angiography shows a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

The next step in management is to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES). PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon catheter into the narrowed coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. DES are then placed in the artery to keep it open. PCI is the preferred treatment for ACS in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It has been shown to improve survival and reduce the risk of recurrent heart attack.

The benefits of PCI include:

* Improved survival
* Reduced risk of recurrent heart attack
* Improved quality of life

The risks of PCI include:

* Bleeding
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Death

The risks of PCI are generally outweighed by the benefits in patients with ACS. However, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of PCI with the patient before making a decision.

Title: Bilateral Painless Cervical Lymphadenopathy in a Child Case is: A child younger than 10 years presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient’s parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory.Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules. Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section (Figure, A). Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present.

Reasoning:
The patient is a child younger than 10 years who presented with an 8-week history of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy unresponsive to a 10-day course of Augmentin. The patient's parents denied any associated fevers, chills, night sweats, sore throat, abdominal pain, or weight changes. Medical history was noncontributory.

Physical examination showed bilateral, mobile, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy without erythema or swelling. Tonsils were symmetric and not enlarged. There was no noticeable thyromegaly or nodules.

Laboratory testing was significant for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (37 mmol/h). Ultrasonography demonstrated cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally with the largest node measuring 3.8 cm in maximum dimension.

Lymph node needle core biopsy demonstrated increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells on tissue section. Scattered neutrophils and rare giant cells were also present. Findings of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains were negative. The CD-68 immunostain showed numerous histiocytes. The specimen stained positive for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains showing emperipolesis. Findings of a CD1a stain were negative. Lymphoid markers by flow cytometry showed a polyclonal mixed B-cell and T-cell population.

Based on the history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is reactive sinus histiocytosis. Reactive sinus histiocytosis is a benign condition that is characterized by hyperplasia of histiocytes in the lymph nodes. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The condition is usually self-limited and resolves without treatment. However, in some cases, it may require treatment with steroids.

The diagnosis of reactive sinus histiocytosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory testing, and imaging findings. The histopathologic findings of reactive sinus histiocytosis are characteristic, with increased histiocytes and numerous plasma cells. The CD-68 immunostain is positive in reactive sinus histiocytosis, while the CD1a stain is negative.

The differential diagnosis for reactive sinus histiocytosis includes infectious mononucleosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Rosai-Dorfman disease. Infectious mononucleosis is a viral infection that is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that is characterized by proliferation of Langerhans cells. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder that is characterized by proliferation of histiocytes.

The treatment for reactive sinus histiocytosis is usually not necessary. The condition is usually self-limited and resolves without treatment. However, in some cases, treatment with steroids may be necessary.

Answer:
C. Reactive sinus histiocytosis

One month after surgery, the surgical wound on the left upper lip was clean and well healed. One year later, there had been no recurrence, and the patient had no symptoms at the left upper lip.

The most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor, accounting for approximately 70% of all salivary gland tumors. Pleomorphic adenomas can occur in any of the salivary glands, but they are most common in the parotid gland. They can present as a slow-growing, painless mass. On physical examination, pleomorphic adenomas are typically firm, well-encapsulated, and non-tender. Histologically, pleomorphic adenomas are composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The epithelial cells can be arranged in a variety of patterns, including ductal, acinar, and myoepithelial. The mesenchymal cells can be of a variety of types, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and chondroblasts. Pleomorphic adenomas are typically treated with surgical excision. The prognosis for pleomorphic adenoma is excellent, with a recurrence rate of less than 10%.

No other lesions were found after complete physical examination. Dermoscopy showed an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained.

The differential diagnosis for an erythematous plaque on the eyelid includes sarcoidosis, discoid lupus erythematosus, basal cell carcinoma, and Bowen disease. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease of the skin characterized by erythematous plaques with follicular plugging, telangiectasia, and scaling. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, and Bowen disease is a precancerous lesion of the skin.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus. The erythematous plaque with follicular plugging, telangiectasia, and scaling are typical findings of discoid lupus erythematosus. The absence of other lesions is also consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus, which is typically a localized disease. The dermoscopic findings of an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales are also consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus. The histopathological findings of a dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional plasma cells and histiocytes are also consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus.

Title: A Man With Infiltrated Plaques on the Pretibial Area Case is: A man in his late 20s presented with mildly itchy, erythematous plaques of 3 months’ duration on both legs. The lesions started to appear on the left pretibial region as small papules, which gradually increased in size and coalesced to form bigger plaques. No history of local trauma, prolonged standing, and occupational exposure to mineral dust or recent drug intake was recollected. He was not diabetic. On examination, large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques were present on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin (Figure, A). There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination (Figure, B and C).A, Clinical photograph on presentation showing ill-defined, erythematous plaques surmounted by multiple atrophic scars.

A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination, which showed unremarkable epidermis and multiple epithelioid cell granulomas in the entire dermis.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes granulomatous mycosis fungoides, pretibial myxedema, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and necrobiosis lipoidica. Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with erythematous, indurated plaques on the skin. Pretibial myxedema is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disorder characterized by deposition of mucin in the dermis of the lower legs. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a chronic, granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that can affect any organ system, but most commonly the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that typically affects the lower legs.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is cutaneous sarcoidosis. This is supported by the patient's history of mildly itchy, erythematous plaques on both legs of 3 months’ duration, the presence of large, ill-defined, erythematous plaques on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs, the surmounting of the plaques by multiple, discrete atrophic scars, the increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences at the periphery of the plaques, along with atrophy of the overlying skin, and the unremarkable epidermis and multiple epithelioid cell granulomas in the entire dermis on histopathological examination.

Physical examination showed multiple firm, erythematous, nontender papules, nodules, and small plaques on his face, his chin, the anterior portion of his neck, and the anterior thorax (Figure 1).

The most likely diagnosis is **cutaneous silica granuloma**. This is a chronic granulomatous skin reaction that can develop after exposure to silica dust. The lesions are typically firm, erythematous, and nontender, and they may be associated with pruritus. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, and it may be confirmed by biopsy.

The differential diagnosis includes sarcoidosis, infectious granuloma, and keloid. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can involve the skin. The lesions of sarcoidosis are typically nontender and may be associated with fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Infectious granulomas can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The lesions of infectious granulomas are typically tender and may be associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and other systemic symptoms. Keloids are hypertrophic scars that can develop after trauma or surgery. They are typically raised, firm, and shiny, and they may be associated with pruritus and pain.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 60s with a known history of a large cyst on the right kidney who sustained blunt trauma in a skiing crash. Computed tomography (CT) showed a right-sided grade IV renal injury involving his known renal cyst with active arterial extravasation. The patient underwent selective angioembolization of the renal laceration.

In the 24 hours after embolization, the patient required 2 U of red blood cells via transfusion for anemia. On examination, the patient reported moderate pain in the abdomen and right side and demonstrated a distended abdomen in the absence of any peritoneal signs. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to assess for a source of continued bleeding.

The CT scan shows a large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma and grade IV renal laceration displacing the patient’s abdominal viscera to the left, with a contrast-filled structure medial to the liver.

The most likely diagnosis is a rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm. This is a collection of blood that forms outside of a blood vessel, often due to trauma. The pseudoaneurysm can rupture, causing bleeding into the abdomen.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Hepatic artery injury would typically cause bleeding into the liver, which is not seen on the CT scan. Jejunal injury with intraluminal contrast extravasation would typically cause bleeding into the small intestine, which is also not seen on the CT scan. Contrast-enhancing gallbladder is a normal finding.

Title: Paraproteinemic Maculopathy in a 63-Year-Old Man Case is: A 63-year-old man was seen with decreased vision in both eyes. He had been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes for 10 years. His visual acuity was 20/40 OU. Fundus examination showed venous dilatation, retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, and serous macular detachment (arrowheads) (Figure 1). Optical coherence tomography scans showed intraretinal fluid accumulation with serous macular detachment in both eyes. He was diagnosed as having nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in both eyes. He received 3 intravitreal bevacizumab injections at 4 weekly intervals and 2 intravitreal triamcinalone acetonide injections in both eyes, with minimal resolution of edema. Blood analysis revealed a low hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL, red blood cell count of 3.3 × 106/μL, white blood cell count of 3460/μL (15% neutrophils, 84% lymphocytes, and 1% monocytes), fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, normal lipid profile, serum urea nitrogen level of 45 mg/dL, and an increased serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (to convert hemoglobin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0; red blood cell count to ×1012 per liter, multiply by 1.0; white blood cell count to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001; blood glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555; serum urea nitrogen to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.357; and serum creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4).A and B, Fundus photographs showing retinal venous dilatation, hemorrhages, hard exudates, and serous macular detachment (arrowheads).What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes for 10 years who presents with decreased vision in both eyes. He has been diagnosed with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema in both eyes. He has received 3 intravitreal bevacizumab injections at 4 weekly intervals and 2 intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injections in both eyes, with minimal resolution of edema. Blood analysis revealed a low hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL, red blood cell count of 3.3 × 106/μL, white blood cell count of 3460/μL (15% neutrophils, 84% lymphocytes, and 1% monocytes), fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dL, normal lipid profile, serum urea nitrogen level of 45 mg/dL, and an increased serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with paraproteinemic maculopathy. Paraproteinemic maculopathy is a rare condition that occurs in patients with monoclonal gammopathies, such as multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. The condition is characterized by serous macular detachment, which can lead to decreased vision.

The patient's blood analysis is also consistent with paraproteinemic maculopathy. The low hemoglobin level and red blood cell count suggest anemia, which is a common finding in patients with multiple myeloma. The white blood cell count is elevated, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions. The fasting blood glucose level is normal, which suggests that the patient does not have diabetes mellitus. The normal lipid profile suggests that the patient does not have hyperlipidemia. The serum urea nitrogen level is elevated, which suggests that the patient has renal insufficiency. The increased serum creatinine level is a more specific finding for renal insufficiency.

The patient's fundus photographs show retinal venous dilatation, hemorrhages, hard exudates, and serous macular detachment. These findings are consistent with paraproteinemic maculopathy.

The patient's clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with paraproteinemic maculopathy. The patient's fundus photographs show the characteristic findings of the condition. The next step in management is to perform plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis to confirm the diagnosis of paraproteinemia. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient can be treated with specific therapies for the underlying condition, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Title: Photophobia in an Immunocompromised Patient Case is: A woman in her early 50s was admitted to the hospital with several days of headaches, bilateral photophobia, and blurry vision. Her medical history was notable for cystic fibrosis, receipt of bilateral lung transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and chronic kidney disease. Earlier treatment for CMV viremia included valganciclovir hydrochloride therapy that was discontinued because of the development of drug resistance and foscarnet sodium therapy with resultant renal dysfunction. The patient was subsequently treated with intravenous renally dosed cidofovir therapy; however, she again developed a nephrotoxic reaction and required dosage reduction in the weeks before presentation. At admission, cidofovir therapy was discontinued because of acute kidney injury (creatinine level, 5.75 mg/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). The findings of a workup for meningitis were unremarkable. Ophthalmic consultation occurred 1 week after admission.The patient’s visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS. Pupils were minimally reactive and without an afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. Portable slitlamp examination findings included bilateral posterior synechiae and a shallow anterior chamber in the left eye. No anterior segment cell was appreciable by portable examination. The patient had early nuclear sclerosis and posterior subcapsular cataracts in both eyes. Results of a fundus examination demonstrated bilateral temporal choroidal elevations without vitritis, vascular sheathing, retinitis, or optic nerve abnormalities. B-scan ultrasonography findings demonstrated bilateral choroidal effusions (Figure 1).B-scan ultrasonographic images obtained at initial presentation demonstrating choroidal effusions in a patient with recent exposure to cidofovir.Discontinue cidofovir therapy, and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegiaWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of photophobia, blurry vision, and headaches are consistent with CMV retinitis, a common complication of CMV viremia in immunocompromised patients. Cidofovir is a first-line treatment for CMV retinitis, but it is nephrotoxic and can cause renal dysfunction. The patient in this case has a history of chronic kidney disease and has already developed acute kidney injury after receiving cidofovir therapy. Therefore, it is important to discontinue cidofovir therapy to prevent further renal damage. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia can help to reduce inflammation and prevent the progression of CMV retinitis. Bilateral subtenon corticosteroid injections may also be used to treat CMV retinitis, but they are not as effective as topical corticosteroids. Oral prednisone is not a first-line treatment for CMV retinitis.

Title: Subacute Vision Loss in a Young Pregnant Patient With Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Case is: A woman in her mid-20s presented with subacute bilateral vision loss that was worse in the left eye. Her medical history was remarkable for type 1 diabetes diagnosed at 16 years of age and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes that had been treated with panretinal photocoagulation 7 years earlier. She had undergone pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser to treat a tractional retinal detachment in her right eye 2 years before this presentation. She also had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and she was 15 weeks into pregnancy. Visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/100 OS. Intraocular pressure was normal bilaterally, and no relative afferent pupillary defect was detected. Findings of an anterior segment examination were normal. The patient was in no apparent distress and denied any headache, chest pain, or focal weakness.Ophthalmoscopic examination (Figure) revealed mild optic nerve head edema that was greater in the left eye than the right eye with associated nerve fiber layer hemorrhage in the left eye. Nerve fiber layer infarctions, dot and blot hemorrhages, and lesions caused by panretinal photocoagulation also were seen bilaterally. Optical coherence tomography showed macular edema that involved the center of the macula in both eyes (Figure, inset).Fundus photographs obtained at presentation that show bilateral peripapillary hemorrhages and mild optic nerve head edema. Insets show the corresponding optical coherence tomographic image.Determine blood glucose level and perform glycated hemoglobin testMeasure heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressureWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is a young woman in her mid-20s with a history of type 1 diabetes and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. She presents with subacute bilateral vision loss that is worse in the left eye. Her medical history also includes hypertension and chronic kidney disease. She is 15 weeks into pregnancy.

The most likely cause of the patient's vision loss is diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Damage to the retina can lead to vision loss.

There are several different types of diabetic retinopathy. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the most severe type. It occurs when new blood vessels grow in the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can bleed. They can also leak fluid, which can cause swelling in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. She has a history of diabetes, and she has vision loss that is worse in the left eye. Her ophthalmoscopic examination shows mild optic nerve head edema that is greater in the left eye than the right eye with associated nerve fiber layer hemorrhage in the left eye. Nerve fiber layer infarctions, dot and blot hemorrhages, and lesions caused by panretinal photocoagulation also are seen bilaterally. Optical coherence tomography showed macular edema that involved the center of the macula in both eyes.

The next step in the management of this patient is to determine her blood glucose level and perform a glycated hemoglobin test. The glycated hemoglobin test is a measure of her average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months. This test will help to determine how well her diabetes is controlled.

If the patient's blood glucose level is not well controlled, she will need to start or adjust her diabetes treatment regimen. This may include taking oral medications, insulin injections, or both. She will also need to make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.

In addition to controlling her blood glucose level, the patient will also need to be treated for her proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This may include laser therapy or surgery. Laser therapy is a procedure that uses a laser to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Surgery may be necessary to remove scar tissue or to repair a retinal detachment.

The patient's vision loss is likely to improve with treatment. However, she may have some permanent vision loss. She will need to be monitored closely by her ophthalmologist to ensure that her condition is stable.

Title: Severe Progressive Vision Loss in a Teenager Case is: A 14-year-old girl was seen with progressive vision loss in both eyes. Two years before our examination, her visual acuity had been 20/200 OD and 20/60 OS. At our initial evaluation, her visual acuity was 20/300 OD and 20/250 OS. Optic nerve atrophy was noted, with no optociliary collaterals. Imaging of the retinal nerve fiber layer showed thinning in both eyes. Automated perimetry demonstrated general constriction of visual fields and bilateral central scotomas. Ocular motility was full, without pain, and orthotropic. Two years prior, initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast was read as normal. Retrospectively, those images were reviewed and noted to be limited due to artifact from dental braces and a lack of fat suppression. Two years prior, lumbar puncture revealed normal opening pressure.Complete blood cell count with differential was negative, as were test results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption, antinuclear antibody, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and serum neuromyelitis optica antibodies. Whole-exome genome sequencing was negative for genes associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 and type 2. After removal of dental braces, MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast demonstrated thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity was noted within the bilateral optic nerves (Figure).A, T1-weighted fat-suppressed image demonstrates thick, nodular, circumferential enhancement in the bilateral optic sheaths.

Her visual acuity has decreased from 20/200 OD and 20/60 OS two years ago to 20/300 OD and 20/250 OS at the time of presentation. She also has optic nerve atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and bilateral central scotomas. Imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast demonstrates thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity is noted within the bilateral optic nerves. These findings are consistent with optic nerve sheath meningioma.

Optic nerve sheath meningioma is a benign tumor that arises from the meninges that surround the optic nerve. It is the most common type of optic nerve tumor, accounting for approximately 60% of all cases. Optic nerve sheath meningioma typically affects women in their 40s and 50s. The most common presenting symptom is vision loss, which is often progressive. Other symptoms may include headache, pain in the eye or orbit, and double vision.

The diagnosis of optic nerve sheath meningioma is made with imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment options include observation, surgery, and radiotherapy. Observation may be appropriate for patients with small tumors that are not causing significant vision loss. Surgery is the most common treatment option for optic nerve sheath meningioma. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor as completely as possible. Radiotherapy may be used after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence.

In this case, the patient has a significant history of progressive vision loss. Her visual acuity has decreased by two lines on the Snellen chart in two years. She also has optic nerve atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and bilateral central scotomas. Imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast demonstrates thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity is noted within the bilateral optic nerves. These findings are highly suspicious for optic nerve sheath meningioma.

The next step in management is to discuss the treatment options with the patient and her family. Observation may be appropriate for patients with small tumors that are not causing significant vision loss. However, in this case, the patient has a significant history of progressive vision loss. Therefore, surgery is the preferred treatment option. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor as completely as possible. Radiotherapy may be used after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 50s with biopsy-proven scalp lichen planopilaris (LPP) who presented with an increasing number of slightly pruritic facial papules that coincided with the start of her hair loss condition. She denied a history of severe acne or other inflammatory skin disorders. The patient had no health problems and only had a distant medical history of an appendectomy and an oophorectomy. The only medication she was taking was hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily that was initiated as treatment of her LPP and did not improve the appearance or symptoms of her facial papules. On physical examination, she had numerous 1-mm skin-colored grouped monomorphic noninflammatory papules on the bilateral temples, the bilateral cheeks, and the chin. A 3-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic examination of a representative lesion on the right chin.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with lichen planopilaris. Lichen planopilaris is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and scarring of the hair follicles, leading to hair loss. The most common presentation is patchy hair loss on the scalp, but the disease can also affect other areas of the body, including the face. The facial papules in the patient are likely due to lichen planopilaris involving the hair follicles in the face.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen are also consistent with lichen planopilaris. Lichen planopilaris is characterized by a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with associated fibrosis and atrophy of the hair follicles. These findings were seen in the biopsy specimen from the patient.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's facial papules includes other causes of facial papules, such as trichoepitheliomas, miliary osteoma cutis, and angiofibromas. Trichoepitheliomas are benign tumors of the hair follicle. Miliary osteoma cutis is a rare condition characterized by small, skin-colored papules that are composed of bone. Angiofibromas are small, red papules that are typically seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis.

The patient's history, clinical presentation, and histopathologic findings are most consistent with lichen planopilaris. Therefore, the diagnosis is lichen planopilaris with facial involvement.

Title: Intertriginous Condyloma-like Plaques and Ulcers Case is: A woman in her 50s with a medical history of hypertension and depression was evaluated by the inpatient dermatology consult service for a 1.5-year history of painful intertriginous wounds. She was previously diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa and treated with surgical excision and split-thickness skin grafting of the genitocrural folds with graft failure. Over the past 1.5 years, she had been admitted to the hospital on multiple occasions for cellulitis around the wounds, which responded to intravenous antibiotics, and she had received a diverting sigmoid colostomy and indwelling urinary catheter to decrease wound contamination. Her wound care required a nursing home. Just prior to presentation, she received adalimumab for 3 months without clinical improvement. On physical examination there were linear moist, eroded, exophytic, condyloma-like plaques of the bilateral submammary folds (Figure, A), intergluteal cleft, and under the abdominal apron. There were ulcers of the bilateral genitocrural folds, as well as vulvar edema (Figure, B). The lips, oropharynx, and ostomy were unremarkable. A wedge biopsy specimen of a submammary plaque was obtained, and histopathology was performed (Figure, C and D).A, Clinical photograph shows a submammary representative linear condyloma-like ulcerated plaque, as well as secondary irritant contact dermatitis from application of topical medications. Similar plaques were present in the bilateral submammary fold, under the abdominal apron and in the intergluteal cleft. B, Clinical photograph of linear ulcers of the genitocrural folds, vulvar edema, and an indwelling urinary catheter. C, Hematoxylin-eosin stain of a biopsy specimen from the submammary plaque.

Title: Nonhealing Crusted Scalp Lesions in a 4-Year-Old Boy Case is: A 4-year-old boy presented to our department of dermatology with a 3-year history of nonhealing crusted scalp lesions. He had previously been treated with various topical glucocorticosteroids and antibiotics without improvement. The physical examination revealed multiple disseminated erythematous papules, petechial hemorrhages, and yellowish crusts on the scalp (Figure, A). The remaining skin and mucosal surfaces, as well as neck, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, were unremarkable. The patient did not show any other obvious abnormalities, but his mother reported occasional otitis media. The family history was negative for skin disease. Routine blood examinations revealed no pathological findings. A whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed 2 osteolytic lesions on the right frontoparietal skull (Figure, B). A punch biopsy specimen of an erythematous papule on the scalp was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological analysis (Figure, C). In addition, immunohistochemical stainings were performed (Figure, D).A, Clinical photograph shows multiple disseminated erythematous papules, petechial hemorrhages and yellowish crusts on the scalp. B, Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial magnetic resonance image shows osteolytic lesions in the frontotemporal skull.

A punch biopsy specimen of an erythematous papule on the scalp was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological analysis. In addition, immunohistochemical stainings were performed.

The histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen shows a subepidermal infiltrate consisting of large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, solitary lymphocytes, and eosinophilic granulocytes. The infiltrate stained positively for CD1A. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).

LCH is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It can affect any organ system, but the skin is the most common site of involvement. The clinical presentation of LCH is variable, but it typically includes skin lesions, bone lesions, and lymphadenopathy.

The treatment of LCH depends on the extent of disease involvement. In mild cases, topical corticosteroids may be effective. In more severe cases, systemic chemotherapy may be necessary. The prognosis for LCH is generally good, with most patients achieving long-term remission.

Title: Evaluation and Management of Self-injury in a Child With a Rare Genomic Variant Case is: A 4-year-old boy was referred to the child psychiatry clinic for management of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior. Tantrums were unpredictable and often resulted in severe head-butting. His parents also reported atypical social and language development, disrupted sleep, and persistent impulsivity with attempts to elope.The patient had a complex medical history that was marked by prematurity at 32 weeks, slow postnatal growth, and severe gastroesophageal reflux. Genetic testing following an episode of hypoglycemia revealed microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16. His pediatrician documented a normal neurological examination without dysmorphology or congenital anomalies.A developmental evaluation revealed delays in motor function and language development notable by age 2 years. He attended a 0 to 3 program with intensive speech therapy and then moved to a self-contained preschool classroom with a 1:1 staff-to-student ratio. He received school-based speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Testing results revealed clinically significant scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Cognitive testing results showed that his IQ was below average but was likely an underestimate due to noncompliance. The parents stated that he played repetitively, lining up toy cars and spinning their wheels. He did not seek or give comfort to others when distressed. He had tactile hypersensitivity but pain hyposensitivity, flicked light switches repetitively, and mouthed objects.In the office, the patient showed a minimal response to clinicians’ social overtures and poor eye contact. He replayed videos on a smartphone while laughing, spinning around, and flapping his hands. He did not respond to prompts for joint engagement and no imaginative play was observed. When the videos stopped, he repeatedly climbed onto chairs and jumped off. As clinicians attempted to redirect him, he became very agitated and his mother intervened physically to protect him from self-injury.Referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier statusPharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletionPharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behaviorReferral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injuryWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a complex medical history and a rare genomic variant. He has a history of tantrums with aggression and self-injurious behavior, atypical social and language development, disrupted sleep, and persistent impulsivity with attempts to elope. He has also been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

The most appropriate next step is to refer the patient to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury. This will help to address the patient's behavioral and emotional difficulties.

Aripiprazole is a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist that has been shown to be effective in treating irritability, agitation, and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorder. Behavioral intervention programs can also be helpful in reducing these symptoms.

A behavioral intervention program will teach the patient and his family coping skills and strategies for managing his behavior. It will also provide a safe and structured environment for the patient to learn and grow.

Pharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion is not a recommended treatment for this patient. R-baclofen is a muscle relaxant that has been shown to be effective in treating spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy. However, there is no evidence that it is effective in treating the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.

Pharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behavior is also not a recommended treatment for this patient. Citalopram is an antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treating depression and anxiety. However, there is no evidence that it is effective in treating the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.

Referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier status is not a necessary or recommended step at this time. The patient's diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is based on his clinical presentation and does not require genetic testing. Genetic testing may be helpful in determining the cause of the patient's autism spectrum disorder, but it is not necessary for treatment.

Title: Recurrent Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Strokes in a Young Adult Case is: An Indian man in his early 40s was admitted for evaluation of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. His medical history included hypertension and gout. He first presented 7 years ago with dizziness, dysarthria, and left hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an acute right corona radiata infarct and 2 right perisylvian ring-enhancing and nodular granulomatous lesions (Figure 1A). Results of head and neck MR angiography were normal. Two weeks after admission he developed fever and asthenia. Brain MRI showed a new right perisylvian lesion with meningeal enhancement. Follow-up MRI after 8 months showed a new right parietal nodular lesion and a right parietal hemorrhage.A, Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at presentation shows an enhancing lesion (arrowhead) in the right frontal lobe on postcontrast axial T1-weighted image. B, Follow-up MRI after 7 years shows a new right parietal hematoma, a chronic pontine infarct, and white matter lesions on coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence.He remained asymptomatic without specific treatment for 7 years, but then developed diplopia; an MRI showed a new pontine infarct. Two months later, skin lesions developed below both knees; skin biopsy showed erythema nodosum. One month later he developed generalized seizures. Brain MRI showed acute parenchymal hemorrhages in the right cerebellum and left frontotemporal and right perisylvian regions, as well as chronic infarcts, multiple microbleeds, and periventricular white-matter lesions (Figure 1B).Results of routine blood tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antiphospholipid and autoimmunity panels, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing were within the reference ranges, and cerebral angiography results were normal. Tests for tuberculosis suggested latent disease (Mantoux test result positive, but CSF adenosine deaminase level and mycobacterial cultures negative). Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was 72 U/L (normal <40 μg/L; to convert to nanokatals per liter, multiply by 16.667). Fluorescein angiogram results were normal. A whole-body computed tomography scan showed nonspecific small, calcified granulomas in the anterior mediastinum. Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography results were normal. A brain biopsy was performed.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: COL4A1 gene mutation , B: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system , C: Polyarteritis nodosa , D: Neurotuberculosis.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a young man with a history of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. He has no known risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, diabetes, or smoking. His MRI shows multiple lesions in the brain, including some that are ring-enhancing and nodular, which are characteristic of granulomatous lesions. The patient also has a positive Mantoux test, suggesting latent tuberculosis infection. A whole-body CT scan shows nonspecific small, calcified granulomas in the anterior mediastinum, which is another finding consistent with tuberculosis. The patient's serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level is elevated, which can be seen in patients with active tuberculosis.

All of these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of neurotuberculosis. Neurotuberculosis is a rare but serious complication of tuberculosis that can affect the brain, spinal cord, and meninges. It is most commonly seen in patients with HIV infection or other immunocompromised states. The diagnosis of neurotuberculosis is often difficult, as the symptoms can be non-specific and the imaging findings can be similar to those of other diseases. However, the combination of the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and laboratory and imaging studies is highly suggestive of neurotuberculosis in this case.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a young man with a history of recurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. He has no known risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, diabetes, or smoking. His first stroke occurred 7 years ago, and he has had several additional strokes since then. The strokes have affected multiple areas of the brain, including the right corona radiata, the right perisylvian region, the right parietal lobe, and the cerebellum. The patient also has skin lesions that are consistent with erythema nodosum.

The most likely diagnosis is neurotuberculosis. Neurotuberculosis is a rare but serious complication of tuberculosis. It occurs when the tuberculosis bacteria spread from the lungs to the brain. Neurotuberculosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, headache, fever, and cognitive impairment. The diagnosis of neurotuberculosis is made based on a history of tuberculosis, a physical examination, and laboratory tests. The gold standard for diagnosis is brain biopsy, which shows the presence of tuberculosis bacteria.

The patient’s medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she has no known history of atopic dermatitis. A fungal smear skin test with potassium hydroxide preparation was performed on the lesion, which showed negative findings.

The most likely diagnosis is juvenile plantar dermatosis (JPD). JPD is a common, self-limiting skin condition that affects the soles of the feet of children and adolescents. It is characterized by well-demarcated, scaly patches on the soles of the feet, often with a "sandal-like" appearance. The lesions are usually pruritic and may be painful. The cause of JPD is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to friction or sweating. There is no specific treatment for JPD, but the lesions usually resolve on their own within a few months. Treatment may include emollients, topical steroids, or oral antihistamines to relieve symptoms.

Tinea pedis is a fungal infection of the feet. It is characterized by a red, scaly rash between the toes, on the soles of the feet, or on the sides of the feet. The rash may be itchy and may be accompanied by burning or stinging. Tinea pedis is treated with antifungal medications, such as creams or ointments.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. This results in thick, red, scaly patches of skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most common on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. There is no cure for psoriasis, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare, chronic skin condition that causes red, scaly patches on the skin. The patches are often itchy and may be accompanied by hair loss. Pityriasis rubra pilaris usually starts on the trunk and then spreads to the arms, legs, and face. There is no cure for pityriasis rubra pilaris, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms.

Title: A Large Abdominal Mass in a Young Man Case is: A man in his 30s presented with abdominal pain associated with unintentional weight loss for 6 months. The patient had a history of hyperlipidemia. Results of examination revealed a palpable mass of about 15 cm in the left paraumbilical region. The patient had a normal right testis but a missing left testis. Results of a computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis revealed large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses. The intraperitoneal heterogenous mass was 20 × 15 × 11 cm, with linear calcifications (Figure 1). There was a right moderate hydronephrosis. The retroperitoneal mass was homogeneous, with associated lymphadenopathy encircling the aorta, inferior mesenteric artery, and both renal arteries. A large left supraclavicular lymph node and left inguinal lymph node were also detected. There was no metastasis identified elsewhere. Serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 1358 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), β human chorionic gonadotrophin was elevated at 1485 mIU/mL (to convert to international units per liter, multiply by 1.0), and α fetoprotein levels were normal.A computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis showing large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses.

Reasoning: The patient is a man in his 30s who presented with abdominal pain associated with unintentional weight loss for 6 months. The patient had a history of hyperlipidemia. Results of examination revealed a palpable mass of about 15 cm in the left paraumbilical region. The patient had a normal right testis but a missing left testis. Results of a computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis revealed large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses. The intraperitoneal heterogenous mass was 20 × 15 × 11 cm, with linear calcifications. There was a right moderate hydronephrosis. The retroperitoneal mass was homogeneous, with associated lymphadenopathy encircling the aorta, inferior mesenteric artery, and both renal arteries. A large left supraclavicular lymph node and left inguinal lymph node were also detected. There was no metastasis identified elsewhere. Serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 1358 U/L, β human chorionic gonadotrophin was elevated at 1485 mIU/mL, and α fetoprotein levels were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer. This is supported by the patient's history of a missing left testis, the presence of a palpable mass in the left paraumbilical region, and the elevated serum β human chorionic gonadotrophin level. The computed tomography scan findings are also consistent with testicular cancer, as they show a large intraperitoneal mass with linear calcifications. The presence of right moderate hydronephrosis is likely due to compression of the right ureter by the tumor mass. The lymphadenopathy seen on the computed tomography scan is also consistent with testicular cancer, as it is often associated with metastatic disease. The absence of metastasis elsewhere is a good prognostic sign.

Other possible diagnoses include colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and lymphoma. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Visual acuity was 20/400 in the left eye, improved to 20/100 with pinhole. Slitlamp examination revealed a small, nasal corneal scar, a small iris defect, iris heterochromia, and a cataract with overlying pigment (Figure 1A). Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye demonstrated vitritis and a hazy view of the retina due to the opacity of the media. A color fundus photograph of the eye showed opacity of the media secondary to the cataract and vitritis and a slightly pale optic nerve. Fluorescein angiography (Figure 1B) demonstrated early hyperfluorescence of an inferotemporal chorioretinal lesion that increased slightly during the course of the study, consistent with possible leakage. There were multiple hypofluorescent dots throughout the retina and an appearance of segmentation of the vessels with slightly decreased venous filling and late staining. A computed tomography scan of the eye and orbit revealed a hyperdense foreign body located along the inferior aspect of the vitreous, approximately at the 5 o'clock position, abutting the retinal surface. Ultrasonography B scan revealed a highly reflective material causing posterior shadowing at the 5 o’clock position.A, Cataract with overlying pigment (yellow arrowhead).

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of chronic conjunctivitis and blurry vision in the left eye since his cornea was scratched by “a piece of wood”. He now presents with progressive dull pain and decreased visual acuity in the left eye. The patient's visual acuity is 20/400 in the left eye, improved to 20/100 with pinhole. Slitlamp examination reveals a small, nasal corneal scar, a small iris defect, iris heterochromia, and a cataract with overlying pigment. Dilated funduscopic examination of the left eye demonstrates vitritis and a hazy view of the retina due to the opacity of the media. A color fundus photograph of the eye shows opacity of the media secondary to the cataract and vitritis and a slightly pale optic nerve. Fluorescein angiography demonstrates early hyperfluorescence of an inferotemporal chorioretinal lesion that increased slightly during the course of the study, consistent with possible leakage.

Ultrasonography B scan revealed a highly reflective material causing posterior shadowing at the 5 o’clock position.

The most likely diagnosis is a retained intraocular foreign body (IOFB) with associated endophthalmitis. The IOFB is likely the cause of the patient's chronic conjunctivitis and blurry vision. The endophthalmitis is likely the cause of the patient's progressive dull pain and decreased visual acuity.

The treatment for an IOFB with associated endophthalmitis is surgery to remove the IOFB and to treat the endophthalmitis. The surgery should be performed as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the eye.

Title: Retinal Pigment Epithelium Tears in a 67-Year-Old Man Case is: A 67-year-old African American man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes status with kidney transplant presented with a 10-day history of sudden-onset, painless vision loss in the right eye. The kidney transplant was performed 4 years previously presumably secondary to diabetic nephropathy, and the patient was receiving daily 5 mg of oral prednisone and 1500 mg of mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride. The patient denied significant ocular history before this episode of vision loss. On examination, his visual acuity was counting fingers OD at 2 ft and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressures were measured at 15 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS, and normal pupillary and anterior segment examination findings were noted in each eye. The patient had several large pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) with associated tears and scrolling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seen on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography in the right eye (Figure 1A). Intravenous fluorescein angiography demonstrated several large window defects with hyperfluorescence in the regions of the RPE tears in the late phase (Figure 1B). Indocyanine green angiography was also performed and did not reveal any hyperfluorescent regions.A, Enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT) of a foveal cross-section at presentation shows a serous retinal detachment and a retinal pigment epithelium tear with scrolled edges seen along the Bruch membrane inferiorly in the image and the other edge of the tear seen attached to the retina at the top left.

Reasoning:
The patient has several large pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) with associated tears and scrolling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seen on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography in the right eye. Intravenous fluorescein angiography demonstrated several large window defects with hyperfluorescence in the regions of the RPE tears in the late phase. Indocyanine green angiography was also performed and did not reveal any hyperfluorescent regions.

The most likely diagnosis is a serous retinal detachment secondary to RPE tears. The treatment for this condition is intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In the case of RPE tears, VEGF can cause the growth of new blood vessels in the vitreous, which can further damage the retina. Intravitreal anti–VEGF treatment can block the action of VEGF and help to prevent the growth of new blood vessels.

Answer:
The correct answer is B. Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment.

Title: A Woman With Confusion and Blurred Vision Case is: A woman in her early 60s presented with bilateral progressive painless blurring of vision for 1 week, associated with metamorphopsia. She was otherwise well and had no history of tuberculosis or underlying immunocompromise. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/60 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral swollen, hyperemic optic discs with multifocal yellowish choroidal lesions located at the midperiphery and posterior pole of the retina. The lesions varied in size, ranging from one-fourth to twice the diameter of the optic disc. Punctate areas of choroiditis were also seen along the temporal arcades (Figure 1A). Results of fundus fluorescein angiography showed bilateral early hypofluorescence, with late staining and leakage from the optic discs. Results of systemic examination were normal, except for coarse crepitations of the right lung. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated, at 80 mm/h, as was the C-reactive protein level, at 20.2 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Chest radiograph showed consolidation in the right lower zone (Figure 1B). However, results of tuberculin skin test, sputum for acid-fast bacilli, and sputum culture were negative. Three days after initial presentation, the patient developed acute binocular horizontal diplopia and disorientation.A, Color fundus photograph revealed bilateral swollen, hyperemic optic discs with multifocal choroidal lesions.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is concerning for a demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers, causing inflammation and damage. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, diplopia, disorientation, and weakness. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is the best test to diagnose multiple sclerosis. It can show lesions in the brain that are characteristic of the disease.

Title: Progressive Bilateral Scleral Pigmentation in a Patient With Ocular Hypertension Case is: A white woman in her mid-60s presented with progressive bilateral scleral pigmentation (Figure 1A). Her ocular history included narrow angles and ocular hypertension that were managed with laser peripheral iridotomy and topical antiglaucomatous medications in both eyes. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS, with intraocular pressure of 21 mm Hg OD and 21 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination demonstrated mild cataract with narrow angles, with patent laser peripheral iridotomy in each eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated peripheral paving-stone degeneration in the right eye and peripheral retinal pigmentary abnormalities in both eyes. During subsequent visits to the clinic, pigmentation was also noted in the auricles of both ears (Figure 1B).External photographs taken at initial presentation. Arrowheads indicate pigmentation.What Would You Do Next? A: Order a B-scan , B: Review medical history and systemic medications , C: Discontinue antiglaucomatous medications , D: Obtain a 24-hour urine sample. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has progressive bilateral scleral pigmentation, which is a rare finding. The most common cause of scleral pigmentation is chronic inflammation, such as uveitis. However, the patient does not have any other signs or symptoms of uveitis. Other possible causes of scleral pigmentation include systemic diseases, such as hemochromatosis and Addison's disease. The patient's medical history and systemic medications should be reviewed to look for any clues to the underlying cause of the scleral pigmentation. A B-scan is a type of ultrasound that can be used to assess the structure of the eye. It can be helpful in diagnosing glaucoma, which is a possible cause of the patient's ocular hypertension. However, a B-scan is not likely to be helpful in diagnosing the underlying cause of the scleral pigmentation. A 24-hour urine sample can be used to test for the presence of certain substances, such as copper and iron. These substances can be elevated in patients with hemochromatosis and Addison's disease, respectively. However, a 24-hour urine sample is not likely to be helpful in diagnosing the underlying cause of the scleral pigmentation.

Title: Conjunctival Hyperemia or Vasodilation and Central Corneal Ulcer in a Neonate Case is: An 11-day-old girl presented with a worsening corneal opacity of the right eye. The patient had received a diagnosis of conjunctivitis at 6 days of life but failed to respond to treatment with topical erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, 0.5%. The baby was an otherwise healthy girl born at full term. Her perinatal history was significant only for a positive maternal test for group B Streptococcus agalactiae, which was treated prior to delivery.Results of the initial examination were significant for conjunctival hyperemia or vasodilation of the right eye, with a 3 × 4-mm central corneal ulcer. Results of B-scan ultrasonography showed no posterior chamber involvement. Corneal cultures for bacteria, fungi, and herpes simplex virus were obtained. Owing to concern for systemic involvement of group B S agalactiae, herpes simplex virus, and other infectious causes, the patient was admitted to the children’s hospital for a full sepsis workup. Treatment with topical polymyxin B sulfate-trimethoprim and intravenous ampicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, and acyclovir sodium was initiated. Results of spinal ultrasonography demonstrated spinal cord tethering at L4, preventing lumbar puncture and collection of cerebrospinal fluid for culture.Two days later, the patient’s right eye developed a hypopyon, and its intraocular pressure was elevated (Figure). Anterior chamber fluid was sent for culture. Results of another B-scan ultrasonography showed a normal posterior segment without inflammation. The topical antibiotic eyedrops were changed to fortified vancomycin hydrochloride, 50 mg/mL, and tobramycin sulfate, 14 mg/mL, and topical timolol maleate, 0.5%, and dorzolamide hydrochloride, 2.0%, were added.

Title: Bilateral Corneal Deposits 1 Week After Starting Oral Prednisone Therapy Case is: A man in his 30s presented with bilateral blurry vision a week after starting prednisone therapy for a presumed seronegative spondyloarthropathy. He had no other pertinent medical history and no relevant ocular history other than anisometropia, for which he wears a corrective contact lens in his right eye. At his initial ophthalmology visit, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/20 OS. In both corneas, he had numerous multicolored, highly refractile crystals located primarily in the subepithelium and anterior stroma (Figure 1). No deposits were noted in the retina of either eye on funduscopic examination.External slitlamp examination of the left eye shows extensive subepithelial and anterior stromal crystals. Similar findings were seen in the right eye.What Would You Do Next? A: Initiate topical prednisolone therapy , B: Superficial corneal biopsy , C: Begin topical fortified vancomycin therapy , D: Penetrating keratoplasty. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has bilateral corneal deposits 1 week after starting prednisone therapy. The most likely cause is drug-induced corneal crystals. These crystals are typically located in the subepithelium and anterior stroma, and they can be seen on slit-lamp examination. Treatment typically involves discontinuing the offending medication and initiating topical prednisolone therapy. In some cases, superficial corneal biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of corneal crystals. Topical fortified vancomycin therapy is not indicated in this case, as it is not effective against drug-induced corneal crystals. Penetrating keratoplasty is rarely necessary for drug-induced corneal crystals, but it may be considered in cases with severe vision loss.

Title: A Peculiar Adenocarcinoma Case is: A man in his 60s presented with a 1-year history of a mild, dry cough. He was otherwise asymptomatic and had no physical limitations. He had never smoked, and results of his physical examination were normal. Results of complete blood cell counts, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests were all within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed a 10 × 9-cm lobulated left lower lobe mass. Examination of a biopsy specimen showed a primary adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile of CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, and napsin A negative. His EGFR (OMIM 131550), ALK (OMIM 105590), and ROS1 (OMIM 165020) genes were wild type, and results of testing for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) were 0%. Results of upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any evidence of a primary malignant neoplasm. Positron emission tomography showed no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or extrathoracic disease. Given the patient’s excellent performance status, he underwent a mediastinoscopy with left lower lobe lobectomy. Results of postoperative pathologic testing showed a 13-cm adenocarcinoma with similar immunohistochemical markers as in the prior biopsy specimen. Surgical margins were negative for involvement, with no large vessel or perineural invasion seen. Five sampled lymph nodes were negative for involvement. Repeat pathologic interpretation was performed (Figure).Initial pathologic testing of a left lower lobe biopsy specimen (hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnification ×100).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Surgical margins were negative for involvement, with no large vessel or perineural invasion seen. Five sampled lymph nodes were negative for involvement. Repeat pathologic interpretation was performed.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma includes primary lung cancer, metastatic cancer, and lymphoma. The patient in this case has a number of features that make metastatic cancer more likely than primary lung cancer. First, he is a man in his 60s, which is the age group at highest risk for metastatic cancer. Second, he has no history of smoking, which is a major risk factor for lung cancer. Third, his chest radiograph showed a lobulated mass, which is a more common finding in metastatic cancer than in primary lung cancer. Fourth, his biopsy specimen showed an adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile that is not typical of primary lung cancer. Finally, his EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 genes were wild type, which makes it less likely that he has a lung cancer that is associated with these gene mutations.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma also includes lymphoma. However, the patient in this case has a number of features that make lymphoma less likely than metastatic cancer. First, he has no history of lymphoma. Second, his chest radiograph showed a lobulated mass, which is a more common finding in metastatic cancer than in lymphoma. Third, his biopsy specimen showed an adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile that is not typical of lymphoma. Fourth, his positron emission tomography showed no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or extrathoracic disease, which is more common in metastatic cancer than in lymphoma.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and the results of his investigations, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic colorectal cancer. The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Title: Hip Fracture and Palpitations in a 92-Year-Old Woman With Bronchiectasis Case is: A 92-year-old woman with a history of long-term bronchiectasis and atrial flutter presented after a fall. She experienced severe pain over the left hip. Radiography of the hip showed a femoral neck fracture, and she was scheduled for emergent hip arthroplasty. She denied any head trauma or loss of consciousness but described occasional palpitations. Her medications included 125 mcg digoxin daily and 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily.On presentation, she was afebrile. Her blood pressure was 168/96 mm Hg, her heart rate was 88 beats per minute, and her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Physical examination showed no gross physical deformity. The trachea was midline and the neck was supple, without any engorged veins. Lung sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Precordial palpation revealed a nonpalpable apex beat. Heart sounds were appreciated loudest over the right parasternal area. S1 and S2 were normal. No S3, murmur, rub, or gallop were present. A soft S4 was heard.

A soft S4 was heard. The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6 (Figure 1).

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is atrial flutter with right ventricular hypertrophy. The patient's history of bronchiectasis and atrial flutter is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's physical examination findings are also consistent with atrial flutter with right ventricular hypertrophy. The patient's 12-lead electrocardiogram shows marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6, which is also consistent with atrial flutter with right ventricular hypertrophy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads. This will allow for a more accurate assessment of the patient's right ventricular hypertrophy. If the electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads confirms the diagnosis of atrial flutter with right ventricular hypertrophy, the patient will need to be treated with anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications. The patient may also need to be treated with digoxin or a beta-blocker to control her heart rate.

The most likely cause of the patient's palpitations is atrial flutter. Atrial flutter is a common arrhythmia in older adults, and it is often associated with underlying heart disease. The patient's history of bronchiectasis is a risk factor for atrial flutter, as is her use of digoxin.

The next step in the evaluation of the patient's palpitations is to obtain an electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of atrial flutter and to assess the patient's risk for thromboembolic complications.

If the electrocardiogram confirms the diagnosis of atrial flutter, the patient should be started on anticoagulation therapy with apixaban or warfarin. She should also be started on rate control therapy with digoxin or beta-blockers.

The patient should be referred to a cardiologist for further management.

Reasoning: The patient is a 92-year-old woman with a history of long-term bronchiectasis and atrial flutter who presented after a fall. She experienced severe pain over the left hip. Radiography of the hip showed a femoral neck fracture, and she was scheduled for emergent hip arthroplasty. She denied any head trauma or loss of consciousness but described occasional palpitations. Her medications included 125 mcg digoxin daily and 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily.On presentation, she was afebrile. Her blood pressure was 168/96 mm Hg, her heart rate was 88 beats per minute, and her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. Physical examination showed no gross physical deformity.

The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6 (Figure 1).

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular rate. The electrocardiogram shows marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6. This is a classic finding in atrial flutter with right ventricular enlargement.

The next step in management is to obtain a high-sensitivity troponin I level to rule out acute coronary syndrome. A D-dimer level should also be obtained to rule out deep vein thrombosis. An electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads may be helpful in further defining the patient's arrhythmia, but it is not necessary at this time. A ventilation/perfusion lung scan is not indicated in this patient.

Title: An Aggressive Sinonasal Mass With Parameningeal Extension Case is: A woman in her 60s presented with a 3-month history of right-sided sinus pressure progressing to dental pain. She was prescribed antibiotics and steroids by her family physician, which initially provided intermittent, symptomatic improvement; however, she ultimately experienced a progressive decrease in tactile sensation on her face, anosmia, and changes in her right peripheral vision. She had a remote 2 pack-year smoking history. Sinus computed tomography (CT) and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large expansile mass arising from the right side of the skull base and nasopharynx with extension into the pterygopalatine fossa, masticator, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, and carotid spaces. In addition, imaging showed involvement of the right posterior orbit with erosion of the posterior maxillary sinus wall, anterior and middle cranial fossa with erosion through the cribriform plate, and cavernous sinus. Physical examination revealed slight right-sided facial fullness, grossly intact extraocular motion, decreased vision in the right lateral field, and palpable bilateral level 2 neck lymph nodes. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a right-sided lobulated mass involving the medial middle turbinate, posterior septum, and nasal floor, as well as the posterior aspect of the maxillary sinus extending superiorly to the nasopharynx and skull base posteriorly. The mass extended into the left superior nasopharynx and superior septum. In-office biopsy specimens were obtained and revealed a primitive small round cell tumor with the following immunohistochemical (IHC) staining profile: diffusely positive for desmin, myogenin, and CD56; focally positive for low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWCK), p63, and S-100; and negative for AE1/AE3, CK 5/6, CK7, CK20, p40, chromogranin, SOX10, HMB45, CD99, and CD20 (Figure 1).Histopathologic images.

Sinus computed tomography (CT) and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large expansile mass arising from the right side of the skull base and nasopharynx with extension into the pterygopalatine fossa, masticator, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, and carotid spaces. In addition, imaging showed involvement of the right posterior orbit with erosion of the posterior maxillary sinus wall, anterior and middle cranial fossa with erosion through the cribriform plate, and cavernous sinus. Physical examination revealed slight right-sided facial fullness, grossly intact extraocular motion, decreased vision in the right lateral field, and palpable bilateral level 2 neck lymph nodes. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a right-sided lobulated mass involving the medial middle turbinate, posterior septum, and nasal floor, as well as the posterior aspect of the maxillary sinus extending superiorly to the nasopharynx and skull base posteriorly. The mass extended into the left superior nasopharynx and superior septum. In-office biopsy specimens were obtained and revealed a primitive small round cell tumor with the following immunohistochemical (IHC) staining profile: diffusely positive for desmin, myogenin, and CD56; focally positive for low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWCK), p63, and S-100; and negative for AE1/AE3, CK 5/6, CK7, CK20, p40, chromogranin, SOX10, HMB45, CD99, and CD20.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is esthesioneuroblastoma. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the olfactory epithelium. It typically presents in adults in the fifth or sixth decade of life, with a slight male predominance. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and anosmia. Physical examination may reveal a mass in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of disease. Biopsy is usually required for definitive diagnosis.

The treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The goal of treatment is to achieve local control of the tumor and to prevent recurrence. The prognosis for esthesioneuroblastoma is variable, depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis. With appropriate treatment, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 70%.

Title: A Rare Cause of Oropharyngeal and Supraglottic Airway Narrowing Case is: A man in his 60s with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dyspnea presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. A noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated splenomegaly, ascites, and a retroperitoneal mass posterior to the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration from the retroperitoneal mass and ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient subsequently developed a left-sided lateral chest wall hematoma, and, in retrospect, it was thought that the retroperitoneal mass was actually a hematoma because multiple follow-up studies demonstrated the mass steadily decreasing in size. Echocardiography showed right atrial and ventricular dilatation and increased thickness of the interventricular septum. Laboratory tests showed elevated results for serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria levels and altered liver function tests but a normal coagulation profile. Routine surveillance noncontrast CT imaging of the neck demonstrated a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing few punctate calcifications centered in the epiglottis with clinically significant narrowing of the oropharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal airways by the enlarged epiglottis (Figure).Computed tomographic images show a soft-tissue mass containing punctate calcifications centered on the epiglottis.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Routine surveillance noncontrast CT imaging of the neck demonstrated a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing few punctate calcifications centered in the epiglottis with clinically significant narrowing of the oropharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal airways by the enlarged epiglottis.

The most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. The buildup of amyloid can damage organs and tissues, leading to a variety of symptoms. Amyloidosis can be caused by a number of different factors, including genetic mutations, chronic inflammation, and exposure to certain toxins.

The patient's history of COPD and dyspnea suggests that he may have had amyloidosis for some time. The development of a retroperitoneal mass and ascites is consistent with amyloidosis involving the kidneys and liver. The patient's echocardiogram showed right atrial and ventricular dilatation and increased thickness of the interventricular septum, which is consistent with amyloidosis involving the heart. The elevated results for serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria levels are also consistent with amyloidosis. The punctate calcifications seen on CT imaging of the neck are characteristic of amyloidosis involving the epiglottis.

The diagnosis of amyloidosis is confirmed by biopsy of an affected organ. Treatment for amyloidosis depends on the underlying cause and the organs and tissues that are involved. In some cases, treatment may involve medications to reduce the production of amyloid or to remove amyloid from the body. In other cases, treatment may involve organ transplantation.

Title: Pulsatile Tinnitus With Imaging Case is: A woman in her 40s presented with right pulsatile tinnitus. She reported constant pulsatile tinnitus with a whooshing quality for 4 years. Factors exacerbating her symptoms included holding her breath and turning her head to the left. She reported that compression of her right neck and turning her head to the right decreased the loudness of the tinnitus. She had not experienced hypertension, vertigo, sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hearing loss, head trauma, history of ear infections, otorrhea, rhinorrhea, ear surgery, or family history of ear problems. The external auditory canals were clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes were intact and mobile bilaterally. There was no evidence of any vascular masses in the middle ear space. Results from testing with tuning forks were normal. Toynbee stethoscope revealed a bruit in the right ear that could be stopped with gentle compression of the right side of the neck. An audiogram showed hearing within normal limits with slight air-bone gaps present at 250, 1000, and 3000 Hz on the right and within normal limits on the left. Speech reception threshold on the right was 10 dB with a word recognition score of 100% bilaterally. The tympanogram result revealed type A bilaterally, and acoustic reflexes were all present. A computed tomographic (CT) temporal bone scan was completed (Figure 1).Computed tomographic images of the right temporal bone. The arrowheads indicate the findings.What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**

The patient in this case has a history of constant pulsatile tinnitus with a whooshing quality for 4 years. Factors exacerbating her symptoms include holding her breath and turning her head to the left. She reported that compression of her right neck and turning her head to the right decreased the loudness of the tinnitus. She had not experienced hypertension, vertigo, sleep apnea, hyperthyroidism, hearing loss, head trauma, history of ear infections, otorrhea, rhinorrhea, ear surgery, or family history of ear problems.

The physical examination was unremarkable, except for a bruit in the right ear that could be stopped with gentle compression of the right side of the neck. An audiogram showed hearing within normal limits with slight air-bone gaps present at 250, 1000, and 3000 Hz on the right and within normal limits on the left. Speech reception threshold on the right was 10 dB with a word recognition score of 100% bilaterally. The tympanogram result revealed type A bilaterally, and acoustic reflexes were all present. A computed tomographic (CT) temporal bone scan was completed, which showed a small dehiscence in the right cochlear promontory.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **carotid cochlear dehiscence**. Carotid cochlear dehiscence is a rare condition in which there is a defect in the bone that separates the internal carotid artery from the cochlea. This can cause pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. The symptoms of carotid cochlear dehiscence are often exacerbated by maneuvers that increase venous pressure, such as holding one's breath or straining.

The diagnosis of carotid cochlear dehiscence is made with a CT temporal bone scan. The CT scan will show the dehiscence in the bone. There is no cure for carotid cochlear dehiscence, but the symptoms can be treated with medications, surgery, or lifestyle changes.

**Answer:**

A. Carotid cochlear dehiscence

Title: Tubular Neck Mass Case is: A man in his 60s presented to a tertiary care center after several months of having right-sided lateral neck pain. He described the pain as “electric” and “stabbing.” He reported no numbness of the region and had not experienced any other symptoms, including new neck masses. His medical history was significant for obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, a right ear skin cancer excised by a dermatologist, and coronary artery disease with angina on stress test. His physical examination revealed a well-healed excision site of the right ear without new skin lesions. His facial nerve was fully intact. He had full strength of the shoulder and no numbness of the right ear or cheek. Palpation of the lateral neck demonstrated a mass running along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an elongated enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the right SCM muscle (Figure 1).A and B, Anterior to posterior coronal fat-saturated T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an enhancing tubular mass of the right side of the neck (yellow arrowhead) that extends posterior and deep to sternocleidomastoid (SCM) (blue arrowheads). C, Axial T1-weighted postcontrast MRI with an enhancing tubular mass (blue arrowheads) that extends posterior and deep to the SCM (blue arrowheads) (white arrowhead indicates external jugular vein).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Primary nerve sheath tumor , B: Thrombophlebitis of external jugular vein , C: Traumatic neuroma from prior surgery , D: Perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:** The patient is a man in his 60s with a history of right ear skin cancer. He presents with right-sided lateral neck pain and a mass along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. MRI shows an elongated enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the right SCM muscle.

The most likely diagnosis is perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Perineural spread is a common route of metastasis for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. It occurs when cancer cells spread along the nerves that innervate the skin. This can lead to pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area.

Thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein is a less likely diagnosis. Thrombophlebitis is inflammation of a vein, with the formation of a blood clot. It can cause pain, redness, and swelling in the affected area. However, it is not typically associated with a mass.

Traumatic neuroma is a rare condition that can occur after surgery or injury to a nerve. It is caused by the growth of new nerve tissue at the site of injury. Traumatic neuromas can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the affected area. However, they are not typically associated with a mass.

Primary nerve sheath tumor is a rare type of tumor that arises from the cells that surround nerves. It can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area. However, it is not typically associated with a mass.

**Answer:** The correct diagnosis is perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 60s who presents with a right-sided lateral neck mass. The mass is described as "electric" and "stabbing" in pain, and the patient reports no numbness of the region. The patient has a history of right ear skin cancer excised by a dermatologist. Physical examination reveals a well-healed excision site of the right ear without new skin lesions. The facial nerve is fully intact. The patient has full strength of the shoulder and no numbness of the right ear or cheek. Palpation of the lateral neck demonstrates a mass running along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an elongated enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the right SCM muscle.

The most likely diagnosis is perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). This is supported by the patient's history of right ear CSCC, the location of the mass along the lateral border of the SCM muscle, and the appearance of the mass on MRI. The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Primary nerve sheath tumor is unlikely because the patient does not have any other symptoms of nerve dysfunction, such as numbness or weakness. Thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein is unlikely because the patient does not have any other symptoms of infection, such as fever or redness. Traumatic neuroma is unlikely because the patient has no history of trauma to the neck.

Title: A 58-Year-Old Man With a Macerated Rash of the Neck and Axilla Case is: A 58-year-old overweight African American man presented with a 5-year history of a slightly pruritic and painful rash of the right lateral area of the neck and right axilla. It was worse during the summers, and blisters sometimes developed. Emollients were unhelpful. The patient was otherwise healthy. His sister had diabetes mellitus and a similar rash in her axillae. The patient performed indoor manual labor as a maintenance engineer and had no significant sun exposure. Physical examination revealed irregularly thickened skin of the right axilla (Figure 1, left) and right lateral area of the neck (Figure 1, right) containing hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, multiple acrochordons (skin tags), malodorous crust, and areas of maceration and erosion. Further examination of the skin revealed pseudofolliculitis barbae in the submental and mandibular regions bilaterally. The nails, oral cavity, and mucosal membranes appeared normal. A biopsy of right axillary skin was performed (Figure 2).Left, Rash of right axilla. Right, Rash of right lateral area of the neck with global view and close-up view (inset).Epidermal acantholysis causing separation of keratinocytes into dilapidated brick wall appearance (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×10).Prescribe a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobialWhat Would You Do Next?

Further examination of the skin revealed pseudofolliculitis barbae in the submental and mandibular regions bilaterally. The nails, oral cavity, and mucosal membranes appeared normal. A biopsy of right axillary skin was performed. The histopathology showed epidermal acantholysis causing separation of keratinocytes into dilapidated brick wall appearance.

The most likely diagnosis is Grover's disease, a chronic, pruritic, papulosquamous eruption that typically affects the axillae and groin. It is more common in middle-aged and elderly men, and is often associated with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no cure for Grover's disease, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment, and they can be used alone or in combination with topical antimicrobials. In severe cases, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

In this case, the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, which is a risk factor for Grover's disease. The biopsy shows epidermal acantholysis, which is a characteristic finding of Grover's disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Grover's disease.

The next step in management is to prescribe a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial. The corticosteroid will help to reduce inflammation and itching, while the antimicrobial will help to prevent secondary infection. The patient should also be advised to keep the area clean and dry, and to avoid sweating. If the symptoms do not improve with topical treatment, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

Title: Trenchlike Ulcer on a Newborn’s Scalp Case is: A neonate in her second week of life was brought to our hospital for evaluation of a scalp lesion initially thought to be an open abscess. She was born full term to a primigravid mother, who had an uncomplicated pregnancy. At parturition, the baby presented in occiput posterior position and remained partly crowned for more than 24 hours of maternal labor. Finally, due to failure to progress, the baby was delivered by urgent cesarean delivery. Birth weight was 3.13 kg (15th percentile), head circumference was 31 cm (<1 percentile), and Apgar score was 9 of 9. The baby’s head had a markedly elongate vertex, which the neonatal intensive care unit team diagnosed as cephalohematoma. On day 5 of life, her serum total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin were 20.5 mg/dL (>95 percentile) and 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 17.104), respectively. The girl was hospitalized for 1 day of phototherapy before being discharged home weighing 2.95 kg (−5.75%). She was exclusively breastfed.She was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of the scalp. Wound culture samples were sent for analysis, and she was given empirical intravenous clindamycin hydrochloride. Dermatology was consulted. On examination, the baby was alert and healthy appearing, although her sclerae were icteric. The vertex of her scalp was uniformly boggy, soft, and edematous, extending beyond suture lines, consistent with a diagnosis of caput succedaneum. On the right occiput, there was a mat of hair and thick serosanguineous crust adhering to the scalp (Figure 1A). Beneath the mat and extending laterally in both directions was a deep, 8 × 1-cm, trenchlike ulcer with no drainage (Figure 1B). It was nontender to palpation.A, Serosanguineous crust adhering to occipital scalp of a neonate. Prior to removing this crust it was being treated as an open ulcer.

Reasoning:
The patient is a neonate who was born full term to a primigravid mother. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. However, she developed a scalp lesion initially thought to be an open abscess. The lesion was nontender to palpation and did not appear to be infected. On examination, the baby had a markedly elongate vertex, which the neonatal intensive care unit team diagnosed as cephalohematoma. On day 5 of life, her serum total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin were 20.5 mg/dL (>95 percentile) and 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 17.104), respectively. The girl was hospitalized for 1 day of phototherapy before being discharged home weighing 2.95 kg (−5.75%). She was exclusively breastfed.

The most likely diagnosis is cellulitis and abscess associated with neonatal group B streptococcal infection. This is a serious infection that can occur in newborns, and it is often associated with scalp lesions. The patient's history of cephalohematoma and her elevated serum bilirubin levels are both risk factors for this infection. The patient's scalp lesion is nontender to palpation and does not appear to be infected, but this can be misleading. Neonatal group B streptococcal infections can be very difficult to diagnose, and they often require treatment with antibiotics.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 20s with panhypopituitarism, septo-optic dysplasia, developmental delay, duodenal stricture, and a history of pancreatitis. He presented with a painful eruption on his bilateral lower legs. The patient was well until 2 days prior to hospitalization when he developed bilateral lower extremity edema. The day prior to admission, he developed painful pink lesions on both legs. He had not applied any topical medications to his legs or had recent exposure to hot tubs or fish tanks at the home. He had a history of keratosis pilaris on the lower legs and was otherwise well with no fevers, recent upper respiratory infections, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Physical examination showed a man in no apparent distress. On the bilateral anterior legs were scattered tender, pink to purple nodules, and plaques. There was also a background of pinpoint folliculocentric papules on leg and thighs consistent with keratosis pilaris. There was 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathology and microbiology cultures. Routine complete blood cell count and complete metabolic panel had results within normal limits.

The differential diagnosis for tender nodules on the lower legs includes erythema nodosum, pancreatic panniculitis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis, and polyarteritis nodosa.

Erythema nodosum is a common, self-limited inflammatory condition of the skin that is characterized by the sudden onset of tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis.

Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare, inflammatory condition of the subcutaneous fat that is associated with pancreatitis. It is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis is a rare, genetic disorder that is characterized by the deficiency of the protein alpha-1-antitrypsin. It is associated with the development of tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities.

Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare, systemic vasculitis that is characterized by the inflammation of medium-sized and small arteries. It is associated with the development of tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of erythema nodosum. The patient has a history of underlying conditions that are associated with erythema nodosum, such as panhypopituitarism and septo-optic dysplasia. The patient's physical examination shows the characteristic tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities. The patient's laboratory tests are within normal limits, which makes polyarteritis nodosa less likely.

The patient's biopsy specimen shows the characteristic findings of erythema nodosum, including superficial and deep, dermal and perivascular inflammation, fibrosis, and fat necrosis.

The patient's diagnosis is erythema nodosum.

Title: Scattered Hypopigmented, Atrophic, and Folliculocentric Papules on the Trunk Case is: A woman in her 60s presented with numerous whitish papules on the back of more than 10 years’ duration. The lesions previously resolved with topical corticosteroids but flared soon after treatment discontinuation. Some papules became pruritic and extended to the waist and anterior trunk in the past month. No family history of similar lesions was recorded. Physical examination revealed multiple hypopigmented, flat-topped papules on the back, waist, and inframammary area without genital involvement (Figure, A). Most lesions were folliculocentric under close inspection. Dermoscopy revealed central keratin plugs and some foci of structureless, whitish, and homogenous areas with surrounding erythema (Figure, B). The results of laboratory tests for antinuclear antibody and hyperglobulinemia were negative.

The most likely diagnosis is lichen amyloidosis. Lichen amyloidosis is a chronic, progressive, and scarring skin disorder characterized by the formation of small, white papules on the trunk and extremities. The papules are usually folliculocentric and may be pruritic. Lichen amyloidosis is caused by the deposition of amyloid in the papillary dermis. Amyloid is a protein that is normally found in the body's tissues and organs, but in lichen amyloidosis, it accumulates in the skin. The deposition of amyloid causes the skin to become thickened and scarred.

The diagnosis of lichen amyloidosis is usually made based on the clinical appearance of the lesions and a biopsy of the skin. The biopsy shows the characteristic deposition of amyloid in the papillary dermis. There is no cure for lichen amyloidosis, but the condition can be treated with topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or phototherapy.

Title: Severe Abdominal Pain With Hypotension Case is: A 78-year-old man with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism who had been taking warfarin for the last 20 years presented with 1 day of severe abdominal pain, which began after eating dinner. The pain had no associated nausea, vomiting, or obstipation. On examination, he was afebrile and had a normal heart rate but was notably hypotensive. He was given 2 L of crystalloid, and his blood pressure responded appropriately. His physical examination showed an abdomen that was soft but diffusely tender without rebound or guarding. He had a well-healed appendectomy scar. Blood testing revealed an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), an elevated lactate level of 29.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.111), an international normalized ratio of 4.6, a lowered hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and a lowered hematocrit level of 27.2%; all other results were unremarkable. Given his coagulopathy, low hematocrit level, and abdominal pain, a computed tomography angiogram was performed to rule out bleeding (Figure 1).A, Axial cross-section computed tomography without contrast of the abdomen and pelvis revealed gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder, high-density material within the lumen, and free intraperitoneal fluid.

Reasoning: The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism who has been taking warfarin for the last 20 years. He presents with 1 day of severe abdominal pain, which began after eating dinner. The pain has no associated nausea, vomiting, or obstipation. On examination, he is afebrile and has a normal heart rate but is notably hypotensive. He was given 2 L of crystalloid, and his blood pressure responded appropriately. His physical examination showed an abdomen that was soft but diffusely tender without rebound or guarding. He had a well-healed appendectomy scar. Blood testing revealed an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), an elevated lactate level of 29.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.111), an international normalized ratio of 4.6, a lowered hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and a lowered hematocrit level of 27.2%; all other results were unremarkable. Given his coagulopathy, low hematocrit level, and abdominal pain, a computed tomography angiogram was performed to rule out bleeding. The computed tomography angiogram revealed gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder, high-density material within the lumen, and free intraperitoneal fluid. The patient was diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) in 1997, and in 2014, he experienced angina that resolved following placement of a drug-eluting stent in his LAD. Coronary angiography via the left femoral artery shows a patent LIMA graft to the LAD, with no evidence of significant coronary artery disease. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication at 23 m are consistent with subclavian steal syndrome. Subclavian steal syndrome is a condition that occurs when a stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery causes blood to be diverted from the ipsilateral vertebral artery to the contralateral subclavian artery. This can result in symptoms of cerebral ischemia, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope. In addition, the patient's blood pressure was 146/65 mm Hg measured on the right arm and 85/50 mm Hg on the left arm, which is consistent with subclavian steal syndrome. The physical examination was notable for a diminished left radial pulse, which is also consistent with subclavian steal syndrome.

Title: A Case of Progressive Dimming Vision Case is: A man in his early 70s with 2 months of progressive dimming of his vision was referred for evaluation. He initially presented to his primary care physician reporting unintentional weight loss, fevers, and subacute visual decline. Subsequent ophthalmic examination revealed mild anterior and posterior inflammation, raising suspicion for panuveitis. Results of laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis were negative. However, a right upper lobe lung mass noted on the chest radiograph proved to be T2N2M0 stage III non–small-cell lung cancer on biopsy.On presentation to us, the patient’s visual acuity was 20/150 OD and 20/200 OS, but improved to 20/70 OU with pinhole. He was pseudophakic with bilateral mild anterior chamber inflammation, moderate vitreous haze, and inferior vitreous condensations. The posterior pole demonstrated bilateral diffuse retinal pigment epithelial alterations with a prominent leopard spot pattern and focal choroidal pigmented lesions. Macular subretinal fluid tracked to the inferior periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography confirmed bilateral subretinal fluid and retinal pigment epithelial irregularity (Figure 1B); nummular hypoautofluorescent lesions were interspersed within areas of hyperautofluorescence on autofluorescence imaging. The optic disc and peripheral vasculature leaked on fluorescein angiography. B-scan ultrasonography also showed diffuse choroidal thickening with focal choroidal thickening consistent with the pigmented choroidal lesions. Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy revealed ciliary cysts associated with anterior thickening of both ciliary bodies.A, Optos photograph of the left eye demonstrating diffuse retinal pigment epithelial alterations in a leopard spot pattern (white arrowhead) and focal choroidal pigmented lesions, as well as subretinal fluid that tracks to the inferior periphery.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient in this case has a history of progressive dimming of his vision, which was initially attributed to panuveitis. However, further testing revealed that he has stage III non–small-cell lung cancer. The patient's ocular findings are consistent with metastatic choroidal disease, which is a common complication of lung cancer.

The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid. This procedure will allow for the removal of the subretinal fluid, which is causing the patient's vision loss. In addition, the procedure will provide access to the choroid, which can be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic disease.

Title: Bulbar Conjunctival Nodule in a Patient With Rheumatoid Arthritis Case is: A 25-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis currently taking oral methotrexate, 25 mg per week, presented with a lesion of the left bulbar conjunctiva of about 1 month’s duration. He had no other symptoms other than occasionally noticing a sensation of a foreign body in that eye and denied any changes in his vision. He had no history of contact lens use, ocular trauma, or ocular surgery. His only other medications were oral vitamin D and folic acid. He was initially treated with topical antibiotics followed by a course of oral sulindac, 200 mg twice daily, without any improvement. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 23 mm Hg OS. The lesion measured 6.5 × 2.5 mm and was firm, nonvascular, slightly mobile, and located on the superotemporal portion of the bulbar conjunctiva (Figure 1). It was purulent in appearance, but no material was expressed with attempted incision and drainage at the slitlamp. A culture was positive only for Propionibacterium acnes. Tests for herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reactions were negative.External slitlamp photograph showing conjunctival lesion at presentation.What Would You Do Next? A: Initiate oral colchicine therapy , B: Observe with serial examinations , C: Perform excisional biopsy , D: Perform intralesional dexamethasone injection. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a conjunctival nodule that is unresponsive to topical antibiotics and oral sulindac. The lesion is firm, nonvascular, and slightly mobile, which suggests that it is a granuloma. The culture is positive for Propionibacterium acnes, which is a common skin commensal that can occasionally cause granulomatous inflammation. The patient also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic autoimmune disease that can be associated with granulomatous inflammation. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid nodule.

Answer: The next step in management is to perform an excisional biopsy of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes, such as a malignancy. After the biopsy, the patient should be treated with oral corticosteroids to suppress the inflammatory process.

A. Initiate oral colchicine therapy is incorrect because colchicine is not indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid nodules.

B. Observe with serial examinations is incorrect because the lesion is unresponsive to treatment and is likely to progress.

C. Perform excisional biopsy is correct.

D. Perform intralesional dexamethasone injection is incorrect because intralesional steroids are not effective in the treatment of rheumatoid nodules.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 2-year-old female with a history of premature birth (24 weeks’ gestational age, 538 g) and zone I, stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with plus disease treated with a single injection of 0.625 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab in each eye. She presents for routine examination at 2 years of age. Examination with the patient under anesthesia with fluorescein angiography revealed significant peripheral retinal avascularity, circumferential vascular loops at the border of vascular and avascular retina, and arteriovenous anastomoses in both eyes. There was no evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrence of ROP.

The management of persistent angiographic abnormalities after intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for retinopathy of prematurity is controversial. Some experts recommend observation, while others recommend repeat intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy or combined intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation to areas of nonperfusion.

The decision of whether to observe or treat should be individualized based on the patient's age, clinical findings, and angiographic findings. In general, patients with persistent angiographic abnormalities who are younger than 1 year of age or who have evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrent ROP are at higher risk for development of vision-threatening complications and should be treated. Patients with persistent angiographic abnormalities who are older than 1 year of age and who do not have evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrent ROP may be observed without treatment.

In this case, the patient is a 2-year-old female with a history of premature birth and zone I, stage 3 ROP with plus disease treated with a single injection of 0.625 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab in each eye. She presents for routine examination at 2 years of age with no evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrent ROP. She has significant peripheral retinal avascularity, circumferential vascular loops at the border of vascular and avascular retina, and arteriovenous anastomoses in both eyes.

Given the patient's age, clinical findings, and angiographic findings, I would recommend observation at this time. I would follow the patient closely with regular examinations and fluorescein angiography to monitor for the development of retinal neovascularization or recurrent ROP. If either of these complications develops, I would treat the patient with laser photocoagulation or combined intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation.

Title: Recurrent Monocular Vision Loss and an Ocular Mass Case is: A woman in her late 50s was referred to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of a 7-month history of recurrent, transient vision loss in the right eye. She reported 5 episodes, each lasting a few minutes and all occurring on awakening. Further inquiry revealed that symptoms always developed after using her electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side. Notably, the patient reported immediate resolution of vision loss on turning on the lights. She denied headaches, visual aura, or neurologic symptoms. Her other medical history was unremarkable.Six months prior to presentation, workup at her local hospital for the transient vision loss revealed an enhancing right orbital mass on magnetic resonance imaging (Figure, A). Carotid ultrasonography and head magnetic resonance angiography showed no abnormalities. Inflammatory marker levels were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging 3 months later showed a stable mass without change in size or appearance.A, T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the orbit with contrast shows a well-circumscribed, enhancing soft-tissue lesion in the right orbit superomedially (arrowhead). B, Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbit with contrast shows the mass (arrowhead); no change noted on Valsalva maneuver.On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and motility were unremarkable. Anterior segment examination showed mild cataract and dry eye. Posterior pole examination revealed evidence of posterior vitreous detachment and normal optic nerves with 0.2 cup-to-disc ratio in each eye. The retina was flat without evidence of whitening or Hollenhorst plaques. Humphrey visual fields were full. Normal retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layer thickness were observed in each eye on optical coherence tomography. Computed tomography of the head revealed no change in orbital lesion size with Valsalva maneuver (Figure, B).What Would You Do Next?

**Reasoning:** The patient is a woman in her late 50s with a 7-month history of recurrent, transient vision loss in the right eye. The symptoms always develop after using her electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side. Notably, the patient reports immediate resolution of vision loss on turning on the lights. She denies headaches, visual aura, or neurologic symptoms. Her other medical history is unremarkable.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) secondary to a right orbital mass. The most common cause of TMVL is retinal artery occlusion, but this is unlikely in the patient's case given the absence of any risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, diabetes, or smoking. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a retinal artery occlusion, as they are always transient and resolve with turning on the lights.

A more likely diagnosis is that the patient's TMVL is secondary to compression of the right optic nerve by the orbital mass. This is supported by the patient's history of symptoms developing after using her electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side. This position would increase the pressure on the right optic nerve, which is located in the right orbit.

The next step in the patient's management is to perform a biopsy of the orbital mass. This will help to determine the underlying cause of the mass and to plan further treatment.

Title: Congenital Restrictive Strabismus Case is: A healthy 1-year-old boy had a history of restricted movements of the left eye since birth. He had been diagnosed as having an orbital capillary hemangioma at 3 months of age after orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which had reportedly revealed an orbital mass with enlarged extraocular muscles. He was treated with oral propranolol with no improvement.On examination, the patient had inferior displacement of the left globe with a severe limitation of supraduction and a mild limitation of horizontal movement in the left eye. He was unable to maintain fixation with the left eye. Results of modified Krimsky testing showed 6 prism diopters (PD) of exotropia and 16 PD of left hypotropia. Retinoscopy disclosed a cycloplegic refraction of +2.00 diopters (D) in the right eye and +6.00 D in the left eye. Thyrotropin, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels were all within reference ranges. Repeated MRI with coronal images showed massive enlargement of the superior, inferior, and medial rectus muscles (Figure 1). The medial rectus mass extended nasally to produce bowing of the lamina papyrecea, with no extension into adjacent structures. The enlarged extraocular muscles were hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. An abnormal curvilinear signal in the intraconal fat was isointense with muscle (Figure 1).A, Coronal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both orbits shows enlarged inferior, medial, and superior rectus muscles with an isointense curvilinear signal in the intraconal fat (arrowhead).

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM). CFEOM is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. It is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, and can cause a variety of eye problems, including strabismus, nystagmus, and amblyopia.

There is no cure for CFEOM, but there are treatments that can help to improve vision and reduce the symptoms. The most common treatment is strabismus surgery, which can correct the misalignment of the eyes. Other treatments may include eyeglasses, contact lenses, or vision therapy.

In the case of this patient, the next step would be to perform genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of CFEOM. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient would be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Title: Chronic Inflammation After YAG Capsulotomy Case is: A 65-year-old man was referred for evaluation of uveitis in the left eye. Several days after YAG capsulotomy for posterior capsule opacification, his left eye had become red and painful and his visual acuity had declined to counting fingers. Inflammation improved but persisted after vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal vancomycin hydrochloride (1.0 mg) and ceftazidime (2.25 mg) followed by intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Vitreous cultures yielded no growth.Six months after the patient’s symptoms began, he presented to our clinic. His visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/160 OS improving to 20/120 OS with pinhole. His intraocular pressure was 32 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. The results of ophthalmic examination of the left eye were notable for pigmented keratic precipitates, a rare anterior chamber cell, 2+ (ie, 16-25 cells per field) anterior vitreous cells, epiretinal membrane, and cystoid macular edema. Tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, syphilis, and HLA-B27 laboratory test results were negative. The macular edema improved with 4 times daily topical prednisolone acetate and ketorolac tromethamine.After 2 months, the patient reported recurrent pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity. At that time, the visual acuity in the left eye was 20/200E at 2 ft, and there were 4+ (ie, >50 cells per field) anterior chamber cells, a layered hypopyon and 2+ anterior vitreous cells. A subsequent vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal vancomycin hydrochloride (1.0 mg) and ceftazidime (2.25 mg) were performed.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of uveitis after YAG capsulotomy. He has had recurrent episodes of inflammation, despite treatment with intravitreal antibiotics and steroids. Vitreous cultures have yielded Propionibacterium acnes.

Propionibacterium acnes is a common skin bacterium that can cause infection in other parts of the body, including the eye. In the eye, it can cause uveitis, endophthalmitis, and other infections.

The patient's uveitis is likely caused by Propionibacterium acnes infection. The infection is likely recurrent because the bacteria have developed resistance to the antibiotics that have been used to treat it.

The next step in management is to remove the intraocular lens and capsule. This will allow the antibiotics to reach the bacteria and kill them. It will also prevent the bacteria from growing and causing further infection.

The patient should also be treated with systemic antibiotics, such as vancomycin. This will help to kill the bacteria that are circulating in the blood.

Title: Gradually Worsening Pruritic Plaques Case is: A woman in her 20s previously prescribed and currently taking valproic acid and phenytoin for epilepsy presented to the clinic with a 2-month history of gradually worsening pruritic plaques that initially involved the scalp, face, and neck, and later affected the anterior and posterior chest wall, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs; she also had nodules over the nose and cheeks (Figure 1A).Clinical photographs show (A) nodules on the head and neck on presentation and (B) nodules of of increasing thickness after 6 months.It was thought that she developed exfoliative dermatitis secondary to valproic acid and phenytoin. Medications were switched to levetiracetam, and a tapering dose of steroid was prescribed. Her skin lesions slightly improved.Two months later, she developed diffuse urticarial lesions of varying sizes over the old plaques. These lesions were well-defined with demarcated borders and were minimally pruritic at the time.Given that her condition worsened despite changing her medication, the lesions were biopsied and analyzed, and the results were inconclusive, demonstrating atypical lymphoid infiltrate. The T cell receptor γ gene (TRG) rearrangement analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative.The plaques and nodules worsened over a 6-month period, becoming more numerous and increasing in thickness, especially on the face, and early leonine facies developed (Figure 1B). The results from analysis of a second biopsy specimen showed dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism. As her condition continued to worsen, a third biopsy specimen was obtained, and the result was consistent with the suspected diagnosis.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her 20s who is currently taking valproic acid and phenytoin for epilepsy. She presented to the clinic with a 2-month history of gradually worsening pruritic plaques that initially involved the scalp, face, and neck, and later affected the anterior and posterior chest wall, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs. She also had nodules over the nose and cheeks.

The patient's condition was initially thought to be exfoliative dermatitis secondary to valproic acid and phenytoin. However, her skin lesions slightly improved after her medications were switched to levetiracetam and she was given a tapering dose of steroids. Two months later, she developed diffuse urticarial lesions of varying sizes over the old plaques. These lesions were well-defined with demarcated borders and were minimally pruritic at the time.

Given that the patient's condition worsened despite changing her medication, the lesions were biopsied and analyzed. The results were inconclusive, demonstrating atypical lymphoid infiltrate. The T cell receptor γ gene (TRG) rearrangement analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative.

The plaques and nodules worsened over a 6-month period, becoming more numerous and increasing in thickness, especially on the face. The patient also developed early leonine facies. The results from analysis of a second biopsy specimen showed dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism. As the patient's condition continued to worsen, a third biopsy specimen was obtained, and the result was consistent with the suspected diagnosis.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a rare, chronic, T-cell lymphoma that typically affects the skin. It is characterized by the development of pruritic, erythematous patches, plaques, and nodules. The lesions may be localized or disseminated. In some cases, the disease may progress to involve lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.

The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides is based on a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy shows a dense, band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes in the dermis. The lymphocytes may be atypical, with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The T cell receptor γ gene (TRG) rearrangement analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be positive in some cases.

The treatment of mycosis fungoides depends on the stage of the disease. In early stages, topical corticosteroids or phototherapy may be effective. In more advanced cases, systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.

A transesophageal echocardiogram was also performed (Video 2 and Video 3).

The most likely diagnosis is mitral valve prolapse (MVP). MVP is a condition in which the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle, does not close properly. This can cause blood to flow back from the left ventricle into the left atrium. MVP is a common condition, affecting up to 2% of the population. It is more common in women than men.

MVP can cause a variety of symptoms, including palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. In some cases, MVP can lead to complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke.

The treatment for MVP depends on the severity of the symptoms and the presence of any complications. In most cases, MVP can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. In some cases, surgery may be necessary.

In the case of this patient, the symptoms are mild and there are no complications. Therefore, the best course of management is to monitor the patient with serial echocardiograms and to treat any symptoms that develop.

Title: A Pediatric Nasopharyngeal Mass Case is: An otherwise healthy 3-year-old boy presented with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. He had no reported respiratory issues at birth and no feeding difficulties. His symptoms included gasping and apneic episodes at night, as well as nighttime nasal congestion. He had been evaluated by an outside otolaryngologist, who had scheduled an adenoidectomy. Intraoperatively, he was found to have a nasopharyngeal mass, and thus surgery was aborted. Nasal endoscopy in clinic revealed a firm, mobile mass in the nasopharynx. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 21 × 14 × 18-mm irregular, but well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left nasopharynx with increased perfusion (Figure, A). Given the vascularity of the tumor, the boy underwent preoperative embolization with interventional radiology. He was subsequently taken to the operating room, where endoscopic resection of the mass and division of the pedicle were performed without complication (Figure, B).

Reasoning:
The patient is a 3-year-old boy with a history of sleep-disordered breathing. He has no reported respiratory issues at birth and no feeding difficulties. His symptoms include gasping and apneic episodes at night, as well as nighttime nasal congestion. He had been evaluated by an outside otolaryngologist, who had scheduled an adenoidectomy. Intraoperatively, he was found to have a nasopharyngeal mass, and thus surgery was aborted. Nasal endoscopy in clinic revealed a firm, mobile mass in the nasopharynx. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 21 × 14 × 18-mm irregular, but well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left nasopharynx with increased perfusion. Given the vascularity of the tumor, the boy underwent preoperative embolization with interventional radiology. He was subsequently taken to the operating room, where endoscopic resection of the mass and division of the pedicle were performed without complication. Final pathologic results demonstrated keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma, with small nests of primitive mesenchyme.

The most likely diagnosis is a **salivary gland anlage tumor**. These tumors are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all pediatric neoplasms. They are typically seen in children younger than 5 years of age, and they most commonly occur in the nasopharynx. Salivary gland anlage tumors are benign, but they can be locally aggressive. They are thought to arise from rests of embryonic salivary gland tissue.

The clinical presentation of a salivary gland anlage tumor is variable. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may present with symptoms such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and otalgia. The tumor may be visible on physical examination as a mass in the nasopharynx. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the size and extent of the tumor.

The treatment of a salivary gland anlage tumor is surgical excision. This can be performed endoscopically or via open surgery. In some cases, radiation therapy may be recommended after surgery. The prognosis for patients with salivary gland anlage tumors is good. Most patients are cured with surgery alone.

He stated that he had recently bitten his cheek and had since experienced increasing spontaneous pain and swelling. There was no obvious swelling extraorally. Oral examination revealed an erythematous, 15 × 10-mm lesion of the buccal mucosa, adjacent to the maxillary first molar. The lesion was hard and produced a small amount of bleeding with palpation (Figure 1).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma , B: Sialolith , C: Intraoral lipoma , D: Unusual mucocele. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is a sialolith. A sialolith is a hard deposit that forms in a salivary gland. It can cause pain, swelling, and infection. The patient in this case has a hard swelling of the inner cheek, which is consistent with a sialolith. The swelling is adjacent to the maxillary first molar, which is where the parotid gland is located. The parotid gland is the largest salivary gland, and it is the most common site for sialoliths. The patient also reports recent biting of the cheek, which could have caused the sialolith to form.

Title: A Painful Submandibular Mass in a Patient With Bruxism Case is: A woman in her 30s with a history of bruxism and long-term use of a bite guard presented with pain centering on left submandibular area for 2 years. She was initially prescribed a muscle relaxant without notable improvement. Physical examination revealed a mild firmness in the left submandibular area. The mucosa of the oral cavity and floor of mouth was normal. Cranial nerve function, including tongue mobility and sensation, was also normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 1.7 × 1.5 × 1.4-cm mass, adjacent to the left submandibular gland. Scattered, nonenlarged lymph nodes were observed (Figure, A). An ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was nondiagnostic owing to an inability to obtain sufficient tissue. The patient underwent surgical exploration with left submandibular gland excision and resection of the left submandibular mass (Figure, B).

Title: An Uncommon Cutaneous Lesion Case is: A male smoker in his 60s presented to the dermatology department with a right supraclavicular cutaneous mass that had persisted for 2 years (Figure, A). This mass underwent progressive growth during the first year but subsequently stabilized. Despite causing occasional pruritus, the lesion was otherwise asymptomatic. A shave biopsy specimen revealed islands of large epithelioid cells with increased mitotic index surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate (Figure, B and C). The tumor cells expressed p16 (Figure, D) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), p63, and CK903, and were negative for prostate-specific antigen, CDX2, thyroid transcription factor 1, S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was negative. Otolaryngology referral was sought to rule out a head or neck primary neoplasm. With the exception of the cutaneous neoplasm, the findings from the otolaryngologic examination were unremarkable. A screening chest computed tomographic (CT) image showed multiple right lung nodules, the largest of which measured 2.4 cm in diameter. A biopsy of this pulmonary nodule showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern, and further workup revealed an intestinal tumor as the primary source. Positron emission tomography and CT imaging demonstrated a mildly fludeoxyglucose F 18–avid superficial supraclavicular soft-tissue mass but no primary head or neck malignant neoplasm or local nodal metastases. A wide local excision of the cutaneous mass and a right level Vb neck dissection were performed. The final pathology report showed residual neoplasm with negative margins and 5 negative lymph nodes.

**Answer:** Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the skin. The patient is a male smoker in his 60s, which are risk factors for lung cancer. The patient presented with a right supraclavicular cutaneous mass that had persisted for 2 years. The mass underwent progressive growth during the first year but subsequently stabilized. Despite causing occasional pruritus, the lesion was otherwise asymptomatic. A shave biopsy specimen revealed islands of large epithelioid cells with increased mitotic index surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor cells expressed p16 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), p63, and CK903, and were negative for prostate-specific antigen, CDX2, thyroid transcription factor 1, S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was negative. Otolaryngology referral was sought to rule out a head or neck primary neoplasm. With the exception of the cutaneous neoplasm, the findings from the otolaryngologic examination were unremarkable. A screening chest computed tomographic (CT) image showed multiple right lung nodules, the largest of which measured 2.4 cm in diameter. A biopsy of this pulmonary nodule showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern, and further workup revealed an intestinal tumor as the primary source. Positron emission tomography and CT imaging demonstrated a mildly fludeoxyglucose F 18–avid superficial supraclavicular soft-tissue mass but no primary head or neck malignant neoplasm or local nodal metastases. A wide local excision of the cutaneous mass and a right level Vb neck dissection were performed. The final pathology report showed residual neoplasm with negative margins and 5 negative lymph nodes. Clinical observation was recommended.

The most common primary sites for metastatic adenocarcinoma to the skin are the lung, breast, and colon. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules are highly suggestive of lung cancer. The findings on the chest CT scan and the biopsy of the pulmonary nodule provide further evidence of a lung primary. The presence of a cutaneous metastasis is a common finding in patients with metastatic lung cancer. The cutaneous metastasis in this case is likely a result of hematogenous spread of tumor cells from the lung to the skin.

The differential diagnosis for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the skin includes other types of metastatic adenocarcinoma, such as metastatic breast cancer or metastatic colon cancer. Melanoma is also a possibility, but the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with melanoma. Cutaneous lymphadenoma is a rare benign condition that can mimic metastatic adenocarcinoma. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are not consistent with cutaneous lymphadenoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the skin.

The patient presented with a right supraclavicular cutaneous mass that had persisted for 2 years. This is a common presentation for metastatic lung cancer to the skin. The mass underwent progressive growth during the first year but subsequently stabilized. This is also a common presentation for metastatic lung cancer to the skin. Despite causing occasional pruritus, the lesion was otherwise asymptomatic. This is also a common presentation for metastatic lung cancer to the skin. A shave biopsy specimen revealed islands of large epithelioid cells with increased mitotic index surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. This is a classic histologic finding for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the skin. The tumor cells expressed p16 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), p63, and CK903, and were negative for prostate-specific antigen, CDX2, thyroid transcription factor 1, S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. These immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was negative. This finding excludes the diagnosis of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is often associated with EBV. Otolaryngology referral was sought to rule out a head or neck primary neoplasm. With the exception of the cutaneous neoplasm, the findings from the otolaryngologic examination were unremarkable. This finding suggests that the cutaneous mass is not a primary head or neck neoplasm. A screening chest computed tomographic (CT) image showed multiple right lung nodules, the largest of which measured 2.4 cm in diameter. A biopsy of this pulmonary nodule showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern, and further workup revealed an intestinal tumor as the primary source. This finding confirms the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the skin. Positron emission tomography and CT imaging demonstrated a mildly fludeoxyglucose F 18–avid superficial supraclavicular soft-tissue mass but no primary head or neck malignant neoplasm or local nodal metastases. This finding suggests that the cutaneous mass is the only site of metastatic disease. A wide local excision of the cutaneous mass and a right level Vb neck dissection were performed. The final pathology report showed residual neoplasm with negative margins and 5 negative lymph nodes. Clinical observation was recommended. This treatment approach is appropriate for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung to the skin.

Clinical observation was recommended.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient's age, smoking history, and the presence of multiple lung nodules are all consistent with this diagnosis. The finding of a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern on biopsy of the pulmonary nodule further supports this diagnosis. The presence of the cutaneous mass is likely a metastasis from the lung cancer. The fact that the mass is mildly fludeoxyglucose F 18–avid on positron emission tomography and CT imaging is also consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is less likely in this patient because he does not have any symptoms or findings suggestive of a nasopharyngeal tumor. Melanoma is also less likely because the patient is not at an increased risk for melanoma and the cutaneous mass does not have any features of melanoma on biopsy. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a rare type of carcinoma that can occur in the nasopharynx. It is also possible to see lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in the skin, but this is much less common. The finding of p16 expression on biopsy of the cutaneous mass is not specific for lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, and it can also be seen in other types of carcinoma, including adenocarcinoma.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with no medical comorbidities who presents with postprandial retrosternal burning that occurred multiple times daily for several years. She had no dysphagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, weight loss, anemia, or exertional chest pain. Over-the-counter antacids provided incomplete benefit. She was prescribed proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with esomeprazole 40 mg, which she took daily, 30 minutes before breakfast. Her heartburn did not improve and continued to bother her daily despite adding famotidine at bedtime. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) results, with esophageal mucosal biopsies, were normal. She was referred for esophageal physiologic testing for possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory reflux monitoring was performed after acid suppressive medications were discontinued for 1 week (Table).

The results of the 24-hour ambulatory reflux monitoring show a mean esophageal acid exposure time of 11 hours, with a maximum pH of 4.0 for 1 minute. These results are consistent with GERD.

The next step in the management of this patient is to increase the dose of esomeprazole to 40 mg twice daily. If the patient's symptoms do not improve with this increase in dose, then a barium esophagogram may be performed to rule out structural abnormalities of the esophagus. If the barium esophagogram is normal, then the patient may be referred to a surgeon for antireflux surgery.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a young man with a 2-month history of itchy skin lesions on his trunk, arms, and groin. He is otherwise healthy, with no other underlying conditions, and he is taking no medications. He has no history of atopic dermatitis or other eczematous dermatoses. There are no associated extracutaneous symptoms. His family medical history is relevant only in that his mother has systemic lupus erythematosus.

On physical examination, there are several erythematous annular patches on the abdomen (flanks and periumbilical region), lower back, groin, wrists, and legs. The lesions show slightly raised red-brown borders and a clear center in some patches with no visible scaling, hypopigmentation, induration, or atrophy.

A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic evaluation.

The histopathologic analysis shows superficial lymphocytic infiltrates in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis. There are also prominent vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction, and in some areas mild lymphocytic exocytosis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth (ALDY). ALDY is a chronic, recurrent, eczematous dermatitis that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by annular or polycyclic erythematous patches with central clearing. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with xerosis, lichenification, and excoriations. The histopathologic findings of ALDY are characteristic, with a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction.

The differential diagnosis of ALDY includes a number of other dermatoses that can present with annular lesions, such as tinea corporis, nummular eczema, and pityriasis rosea. However, the history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings in this patient are most consistent with ALDY.

The first lesion appeared as an erythematous papule, which grew and subsequently ulcerated. Within a few months, she developed other indurated plaques on her legs. The ulcer was painful on palpation, but the plaques were mostly asymptomatic. The patient did not have fevers, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis. She had moved to Canada from China 30 years ago and was unsure about tuberculosis (TB) exposure and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine status. Her medical history included atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and Parkinson disease. Physical examination showed a 5 × 4-cm, well-demarcated, oval ulcer with a violaceous, dusky border and central yellow fibrin mixed with granulation tissue on the left lateral aspect of the calf. There were numerous violaceous to dull red, indurated plaques on the posterior aspect of the legs. Wound cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes infective panniculitides, erythema nodosum, erythema induratum, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Infective panniculitides are a group of diseases that involve inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. They can be caused by a variety of infections, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Erythema nodosum is a skin condition that is characterized by the formation of tender, red nodules on the lower legs. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and Behçet's disease. Erythema induratum is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the formation of indurated plaques on the lower legs. It is often associated with tuberculosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the formation of painful, necrotic ulcers. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is erythema induratum. This is supported by the patient's history of a chronic, nonhealing ulcer on the lower leg. The ulcer is violaceous and indurated, which are characteristic features of erythema induratum. The patient also has a history of tuberculosis, which is a known association with erythema induratum. The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Infective panniculitides are typically associated with fever, chills, and other systemic symptoms. Erythema nodosum is typically associated with tender, red nodules on the lower legs. Pyoderma gangrenosum is typically associated with painful, necrotic ulcers.

She has been treated with potent topical corticosteroids and oral prednisone, with no improvement. The physical examination shows several discrete, erythematous, scaly papules admixed with light brown reticulated macules and patches. Punch biopsy specimens show eosinophilic spongiosis with interface dermatitis, dyskeratosis, and neutrophilic exocytosis. Prominent dermal melanophages are present.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes erythema ab igne, prurigo pigmentosa, Dowling-Degos disease, and confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.

Erythema ab igne is a benign condition that is caused by prolonged exposure to heat, such as from a heating pad or space heater. It is characterized by a reticulated pattern of erythema and hyperpigmentation. The patient in this case does not have a history of exposure to heat, and her biopsy does not show the characteristic findings of erythema ab igne.

Prurigo pigmentosa is a chronic, pruritic condition that is characterized by small, erythematous papules that become hyperpigmented. The patient in this case has a history of recurrent, pruritic skin eruptions, and her biopsy shows the characteristic findings of prurigo pigmentosa.

Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, progressive, and potentially fatal condition that is characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation and poikiloderma. The patient in this case does not have the characteristic clinical or histopathologic findings of Dowling-Degos disease.

Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is a benign condition that is characterized by confluent and reticulated papillomas. The patient in this case does not have the characteristic clinical or histopathologic findings of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.

The most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is prurigo pigmentosa.

Title: Evolution of Unilateral Basal Ganglia Lesion Over 16 Months Case is: An adolescent boy presented with cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and progressively worsening weakness of the left arm and leg. The patient was subsequently admitted to our hospital for further evaluation. Sixteen months earlier, the patient was admitted to a hospital for weakness of the left fingers and mild spasticity of the left lower extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time revealed a suspicious lesion in the right basal ganglia (Figure, A). In addition, carotid and intracranial angiography revealed no abnormalities (not shown). Slight weakness in the left lower extremity was detected 3 months later. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed nonhomogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighted images in the right basal ganglia without mass effect (Figure, B). Atrophy of the right cerebral hemisphere and right cerebral peduncle was observed (not shown). A, T2-weighted axial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the basal ganglia level performed 16 months before the current hospitalization showing slight hyperintensity at the right putamen and posterior limb of the internal capsule (arrowhead). B, T2-weighted axial MRI performed 13 months before the current hospitalization showing moderate hyperintensity at the right basal ganglia without mass effect (arrowhead). C, T2-weighted axial MRI at the basal ganglia level showing remarkable progression of the lesions in the right basal ganglia and thalamus with heterogeneous high signal intensity and multicystic change (arrowhead).There was no history of tumors elsewhere, and his family history was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed distal left hemiparesis, left facial palsy, and decreased pinprick sensation in his left face and extremities. On MRI, the lesion appeared larger than before (Figure, C), with remarkable heterogeneous enhancement (not shown).

On MRI, the lesion appeared larger than before, with remarkable heterogeneous enhancement. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were normal. A hormone assay disclosed normal pituitary function.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a glioma. Gliomas are a type of brain tumor that arise from glial cells, which are the cells that support and protect neurons. Gliomas can be classified into different subtypes based on their cell type and grade. The most common type of glioma is a low-grade astrocytoma, which is a slow-growing tumor. However, gliomas can also be high-grade tumors, which are more aggressive and can spread to other parts of the brain.

The patient's history of cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and weakness of the left arm and leg are all consistent with a glioma. The patient's MRI findings also support the diagnosis of a glioma. The MRI showed a suspicious lesion in the right basal ganglia, which is a common location for gliomas. The lesion was also nonhomogeneous and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, which are findings that are often seen in gliomas. The patient's HCG levels were normal, which helps to rule out a germinoma. The patient's hormone assay also showed normal pituitary function, which helps to rule out a demyelinating disorder.

Title: Lateral Displacement of the Inner Canthi in a Child of Deaf Parents Case is: A young boy and his parents presented for consultation about the child’s risk for development of hearing loss, given a family history of deafness in both parents. Both parents were diagnosed with profound, nonprogressive sensorineural hearing loss within the first year of life. A homozygous mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2 [OMIM 121011]) was found in the mother, whereas the father remained without a causative diagnosis. No other relatives had hearing impairment.The child was born full term without complications. Growth and language skills were appropriate for age. Hearing screening at birth and the repeated auditory evaluations at follow-up had normal findings. The physical examination was unremarkable except for some midfacial features consisting of a lateral displacement of the inner canthi of the eyes with a broad nasal root, small nostrils, and medial eyebrow flare (Figure, A). The same midfacial anomalies were observed in his father (Figure, B), in whom a hypopigmented patch on the left arm and bright blue eyes were also noticed. Visual acuity and kidney function were normal, and no skeletal deformities were appreciated in the child or his father.The child and his father demonstrate a lateral displacement of the inner canthi.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Stickler syndrome , B: Waardenburg syndrome type 1 , C: X-linked Alport syndrome , D: Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The child and his father both have a lateral displacement of the inner canthi, which is a characteristic finding of Waardenburg syndrome type 1. Additionally, the father has a hypopigmented patch on the left arm and bright blue eyes, which are also features of Waardenburg syndrome type 1. The child's hearing screening at birth and the repeated auditory evaluations at follow-up had normal findings, which makes it unlikely that he has Stickler syndrome or X-linked Alport syndrome. Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation is a rare cause of hearing loss, and it is not associated with the other features that are present in this case.

Title: Patient With Ulcerative Colitis and Abdominal Pain Case is:  A 25-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain. She received a diagnosis of UC 6 years earlier and has taken mesalamine to control UC. She was discharged a week before this admission for a UC flare that was managed with prednisone. Review of systems was notable for diarrhea; however, she denied hematochezia, melena, emesis, fevers, or changes in urination.Her last colonoscopy was 3 years ago, and UC without evidence of dysplasia was confirmed. Otherwise, her medical history was unremarkable. Family history was negative for inflammatory bowel diseases and gastrointestinal malignancies. On examination, she was afebrile with normal vital signs. Her abdomen was tender to palpation in the left lower quadrant, which was soft and nondistended.The patient’s complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel results were unremarkable. Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis demonstrated a thickened colon from the middescending colon to the rectosigmoid. There was also a 2.7-cm intramural abscess in the descending colon. She started receiving piperacillin/tazobactam but began to have increased abdominal pain, emesis, and inability to tolerate oral intake. A repeated computed tomographic scan performed 4 days after the original scan demonstrated that the intramural mass had increased to 3.5 cm and was partially obstructing the descending colon. She underwent a colonoscopy, which demonstrated multiple areas of inflammation in the rectum through the descending colon (Figure 1). Nothing proximal to the midtransverse colon was visualized because of a large fecal burden.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The most likely diagnosis is a flare of ulcerative colitis. The patient has a history of UC, and her symptoms are consistent with a flare. The CT scan showed a thickened colon with an intramural abscess, which is also consistent with a flare of UC. The colonoscopy showed multiple areas of inflammation in the rectum through the descending colon, which is further evidence of a flare of UC.

The other possible diagnoses are conversion to Crohn disease, adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma. Conversion to Crohn disease is unlikely, as the patient has a long history of UC and no prior evidence of Crohn disease. Adenocarcinoma is also unlikely, as the patient is young and has no risk factors for colon cancer. Lymphoma is also unlikely, as the patient has no systemic symptoms and no lymphadenopathy.

Title: White Retinal Lesions in a Patient With Leukemia Case is: A 25-year-old white man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia reported blurry vision in the left eye for 24 hours and gradually worsening floaters for 1 week. He was already admitted for induction chemotherapy after a relapse of his acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The findings of a previous inpatient eye examination performed 3 weeks earlier were unremarkable. During his hospitalization, he was noted to have persistent fevers of unclear origin and neutropenia. He was receiving prophylactic cefepime and amphotericin B prescribed by the infectious diseases service. Up to this point, the results of multiple systemic cultures were negative other than a skin biopsy specimen of a concerning papular rash that was noted to yield Candida tropicalis. Vision was 20/20 OD and 20/100 OS. He denied any pain or photophobia. Anterior segment examination findings were unremarkable. Dilated fundoscopy revealed multiple yellow-white subretinal lesions with associated hemorrhages and vitritis in the left eye (Figure 1).Left eye fundus photograph shows multiple creamy white subretinal lesions with associated hemorrhages and optic nerve head edema. Vitritis accounts for the hazy view.What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has multiple white retinal lesions with associated hemorrhages and vitritis in the left eye. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis, which is a serious infection of the eye that can lead to blindness. The most common cause of fungal endophthalmitis in patients with leukemia is Candida albicans. Other possible causes include Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Fusarium spp.

The patient's risk factors for fungal endophthalmitis include his leukemia, his neutropenia, and his use of prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's fevers of unclear origin and his skin rash are also concerning for systemic candidiasis.

The treatment of fungal endophthalmitis is prompt and aggressive. The first step is to remove as much of the infected material as possible, which can be done with a vitrectomy. Intravitreal antifungal injections are also necessary. The patient may also need systemic antifungal therapy.

In this case, the patient should undergo a pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy to remove as much of the infected material as possible. He should also receive intravitreal antifungal injections and systemic antifungal therapy.

Title: Intraorbital Bullet Case is: A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department after being shot with a .22-caliber pistol. The bullet passed through a wooden door before entering the patient’s right orbit. His ocular history included exotropia and amblyopia in the right eye. An examination revealed normal pupillary light reflexes, a visual acuity of 20/70 OD and 20/40 OS, and normal color vision OU.There was 3 mm of proptosis in the right eye, as well as right-sided periocular ecchymosis. An entry wound was visible inferior to the right medial canthus, and the right upper and lower eyelids had full-thickness lacerations involving the canaliculi. The patient had a large-angle alternating exotropia, as well as mild supraduction, infraduction, and adduction deficits in the right eye. Severe pain was noted with supraduction and infraduction of the right eye. A slitlamp examination of the right eye revealed a normal anterior segment, while a mild vitreous hemorrhage, extramacular retinal whitening, and a subretinal hemorrhage in the inferonasal periphery was noted on ophthalmoscopic examination. The left globe was within normal limits and intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg OD and 8 mm Hg OS.A computed tomography scan showed a large extraconal inferonasal metallic foreign body (FB) within the right orbit that was abutting the inferior rectus muscle without fractures or intracranial intrusion (Figure 1).Computed tomography scan of the orbit demonstrates a large extraconal metallic foreign body of the right orbit abutting the inferior rectus muscle on coronal (A) and sagittal (B) images.Obtain a magnetic resonance imaging study to further delineate the soft tissue injuryRepair canalicular lacerations and leave the foreign body in placeRepair canalicular lacerations and perform an orbitotomy for FB removalWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a large extraconal inferonasal metallic foreign body (FB) within the right orbit that is abutting the inferior rectus muscle without fractures or intracranial intrusion. The FB should be removed as soon as possible to prevent infection, inflammation, and injury to the optic nerve and other orbital structures. A magnetic resonance imaging study is not necessary to further delineate the soft tissue injury, as the CT scan has already provided adequate information. Repairing the canalicular lacerations without removing the FB would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and could potentially lead to further complications. Therefore, the best course of action is to repair the canalicular lacerations and perform an orbitotomy for FB removal.

Title: Acute Monocular Vision Loss in a Young Adult Case is: A woman in her 20s was referred to our retina clinic for blurry vision in the left eye that she noticed on waking. Her medical history was negative for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. Her only medication was oral contraception (OCP). The patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. Confrontational visual fields and results of external eye examination were normal. She had full ocular motility and no afferent pupillary defect. Results of the right eye fundus examination were unremarkable (Figure, A). The left eye (Figure, B) had tortuosity and dilation of all branches of the retinal vein, disc edema, scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, and nasal macula nerve fiber layer infarcts. The vitreous was clear, macula flat, and there was no retinal neovascularization. Results of optical coherence tomography confirmed the absence of cystoid macular edema and demonstrated nerve fiber layer thickening and hyperreflectivity, consistent with a nerve fiber layer infarct.A, Right fundus photograph demonstrating absence of vessel tortuosity and dilation, disc edema, infarcts, and hemorrhages.

**Reasoning:** The patient in this case presents with acute monocular vision loss in a young adult, which is a concerning finding. The most common cause of acute monocular vision loss in young adults is central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), which is a blockage of the central retinal vein. CRVO can be caused by a number of factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and hypercoagulable disorders.

The patient in this case has no history of these risk factors, but she is taking oral contraception (OCP). OCPs have been associated with an increased risk of CRVO, so it is important to consider this possibility in her case.

The patient's fundus examination shows tortuosity and dilation of all branches of the retinal vein, disc edema, scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, and nasal macula nerve fiber layer infarcts. These findings are consistent with CRVO.

The next step in the management of this patient is to review her medical and family history for hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases. If no underlying cause is found, then the patient should be started on treatment with intravenous steroids. Steroids can help to reduce inflammation and improve vision in patients with CRVO.

Title: A Painful Red Eye Case is: A 63-year-old white man with a history of cigarette use (≥80 pack-years) and alcohol dependence presented to the ophthalmology clinic with several weeks of left eye pain and redness. A review of systems was remarkable for unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and cough with scant sputum. On presentation, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Intraocular pressure, pupillary reaction, and ocular motility were normal. The right eye had normal anterior and posterior segment examination findings. The left eye was notable for mostly superior conjunctival and scleral hyperemia with dilated scleral vessels and associated scleral thinning with a conjunctival epithelial defect (Figure 1). The results of posterior examination of the left eye were normal. Results of serologic tests, including Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay, HIV, hepatitis B and C, Lyme antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide, were negative. Angiotensin-converting enzyme level, uric acid level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood cell count, and basic metabolic panel results were within normal limits. The results of proteinase 3–antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing and interferon γ release assay using QuantiFERON-TB gold (QFT) (Qiagen) were positive. Chest computed tomography revealed tiny, scattered solid pulmonary nodules that were too small to characterize according to the radiology department. The patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic, where the results of sputum culture and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacteria tuberculosis were negative. Pulmonology evaluation determined that the pulmonary nodules were too small for biopsy via bronchoscopy.Slitlamp photograph of the left eye shows diffuse hyperemia with dilated vessels and scleral thinning.Initiate rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapyWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a history of cigarette use and alcohol dependence, which are risk factors for tuberculosis. The patient also has several weeks of left eye pain and redness, which are symptoms of uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including tuberculosis. The patient's chest computed tomography revealed tiny, scattered solid pulmonary nodules that were too small to characterize. These nodules could be caused by tuberculosis. The patient's sputum culture and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacteria tuberculosis were negative, but this does not rule out tuberculosis. The patient's pulmonary nodules were too small for biopsy via bronchoscopy. Therefore, the patient's most likely diagnosis is uveitis caused by tuberculosis. The treatment for uveitis caused by tuberculosis is a combination of anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.

Title: A Young Man With Disseminated Intra-abdominal Masses Case is: A man in his 20s presented with a 2-month history of vague, right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, with associated 5-kg weight loss, loss of appetite, and increasing abdominal distension. He reported a small mass in the right scrotum that was evaluated 5 years previously and was reassured to be a nonmalignant lesion. Physical examination was notable for a distended abdomen with a palpable left abdominal mass. Testicular examination revealed an approximately 1-cm firm right spermatic cord nodule. Laboratory tests showed lactate dehydrogenase levels of 818 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167), with no significant β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein levels. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (Figure, A and B) revealed innumerable masses throughout the abdomen and pelvis, with the largest measuring 17.5 × 14 × 14 cm and a 3.9-cm enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe, and a small amount of ascites. Testicular sonogram disclosed a 1.5-cm right epididymal cyst.

Reasoning: The patient is a young man with a history of a small mass in the right scrotum that was evaluated 5 years previously and was reassured to be a nonmalignant lesion. He now presents with a 2-month history of vague, right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, with associated 5-kg weight loss, loss of appetite, and increasing abdominal distension. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with a palpable left abdominal mass. Testicular examination reveals an approximately 1-cm firm right spermatic cord nodule. Laboratory tests show lactate dehydrogenase levels of 818 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167), with no significant β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein levels.

Percutaneous biopsy and histologic examination of the dominant left abdominal mass reveals neoplastic cells that are positive for cytokeratin, desmin but negative for S100. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is positive for EWS-WT1 rearrangement.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic testicular carcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history of a testicular mass, the presence of innumerable abdominal masses on CT imaging, the positive FISH test for EWS-WT1 rearrangement, and the negative results of β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein testing. Other possible diagnoses include metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient in this case has a history of sudden cardiac death in her family, as well as palpitations, breathlessness, chest pain, and episodes of light-headedness. Her physical examination and electrocardiogram are unremarkable, but her 24-hour Holter monitoring trace shows ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography reveals normal coronary arteries.

The next step in management is to determine the frequency of the ventricular tachycardia. This can be done with an invasive electrophysiological study or by implanting a device to monitor the heart rhythm.

An invasive electrophysiological study involves inserting catheters into the heart to record electrical activity. This can be used to identify the cause of the ventricular tachycardia and to guide treatment. However, it is a risky procedure with potential complications.

Implanting a device to monitor the heart rhythm is a less risky procedure. The device, called a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED), is placed under the skin and records the heart's electrical activity. This information can be used to determine the frequency of the ventricular tachycardia and to identify any triggers.

In this case, I would recommend implanting a CIED to determine the frequency of the ventricular tachycardia. This will allow me to assess the risk of sudden cardiac death and to recommend appropriate treatment.

Answer:
B. Implant a device to determine frequency of ventricular tachycardia.

Title: Adult-Onset Giant Cervical Mass Case is: An otherwise healthy man in his 40s was referred to our ear, nose, and throat department for the evaluation of a giant, left-sided neck mass. He reported no antecedent neck trauma or neck infection, nor any history of swelling during childhood. He experienced dyspnea, limitation of neck movements, and neck tightness owing to the bulkiness of the lesion. The swelling had been present for approximately 12 months, and the growth was gradual and continuous. Contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 15 × 7-cm homogenous ovoid bilobulated cystic mass in the left lateral region of the neck with displacement of the surrounding musculature and vascular structures but no sign of invasion. The imaging of the lesion revealed fibrous septae in the central and inferior parts, with extension to the supraclavicular region (Figure, A and B). After written informed consent was obtained, the patient underwent total excision of the cystic mass through an apron flap incision combined with T-incision for preservation of cranial nerve XI and sternocleoidomastoid muscle (Figure, C).A, T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) shows a homogenous ovoid bilobulated hypointense cystic mass in left parapharyngeal area and posterior cervical region, extending to the supraclavicular triangle. B, T2-weighted MRI demonstrates thin-walled, markedly hyperintense cystic mass indenting neighboring structures. No fluid-fluid level is observed. C, Cervical mass with preservation of the vital structures of the neck.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Branchial cleft cyst , B: Glomus tumor , C: Liposarcoma , D: Cervical lymphatic malformation. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient is a 40-year-old man with a 12-month history of a giant, left-sided neck mass. The mass is gradually enlarging and causing dyspnea, limitation of neck movements, and neck tightness. On physical examination, the mass is a large, lobulated, cystic mass in the left lateral neck. Imaging studies reveal a 15 × 7-cm homogenous ovoid bilobulated cystic mass in the left lateral region of the neck with displacement of the surrounding musculature and vascular structures but no sign of invasion. The imaging of the lesion revealed fibrous septae in the central and inferior parts, with extension to the supraclavicular region.

The differential diagnosis for a giant, cystic mass in the neck includes branchial cleft cyst, glomus tumor, liposarcoma, and cervical lymphatic malformation. Branchial cleft cysts are the most common congenital neck mass, accounting for up to 70% of all cases. They are usually located in the anterior triangle of the neck, just below the angle of the mandible. Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus body, a small vascular structure located in the skin and soft tissues. They are typically small, <1 cm in diameter, and are often painful. Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of fat cells. They are the most common soft tissue sarcoma in adults, accounting for up to 50% of all cases. Cervical lymphatic malformations are rare, congenital malformations of the lymphatic system. They can be classified as cystic hygromas, lymphangiomas, or lymphangiectasias.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a branchial cleft cyst. This is supported by the patient's history of a slowly enlarging neck mass, the location of the mass in the left lateral neck, and the imaging findings of a homogenous ovoid bilobulated cystic mass with displacement of the surrounding musculature and vascular structures but no sign of invasion.

Answer: A (Branchial cleft cyst)

Title: Nasopharyngeal Swelling in a Patient With Cystic Fibrosis Following Endoscopic Sinus Surgery Case is: A woman in her 20s with a history of cystic fibrosis underwent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery and medial maxillectomy 4 months after bilateral lung transplantation. She presented to her rhinologist for follow-up 6 weeks after surgery reporting improved nasal obstruction and olfaction, but complained of 2 weeks of throat pain and swelling. Physical examination revealed bilateral tonsillar erythema, exudate, tenderness, and peritonsillar edema. She was prescribed amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for presumed tonsillitis and began to improve. Two weeks later her symptoms returned, now accompanied by new-onset snoring and nasal obstruction. Nasal endoscopy revealed nasopharyngeal soft-tissue swelling with mucopurulent secretions on the left side. She was referred for a computed tomographic scan with contrast, which showed a rim-enhancing, multilocular hypodense collection extending from the left nasopharynx inferiorly to the level of the right palatine tonsil (Figure 1). On the basis of the radiographic findings, she was taken to the operating room urgently. Intraoperative endoscopy revealed ulceration and necrotic debris in the nasopharynx and oropharynx. Culture and biopsy specimens were obtained.What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 20s with a history of cystic fibrosis who underwent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery and medial maxillectomy 4 months after bilateral lung transplantation. She presented to her rhinologist for follow-up 6 weeks after surgery reporting improved nasal obstruction and olfaction, but complained of 2 weeks of throat pain and swelling. Physical examination revealed bilateral tonsillar erythema, exudate, tenderness, and peritonsillar edema. She was prescribed amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for presumed tonsillitis and began to improve.

On the basis of the radiographic findings, she was taken to the operating room urgently. Intraoperative endoscopy revealed ulceration and necrotic debris in the nasopharynx and oropharynx. Culture and biopsy specimens were obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is **A: Mycobacterial abscess**. This is supported by the patient's history of cystic fibrosis, which is a risk factor for mycobacterial infections. The patient's symptoms of throat pain and swelling, as well as the findings on physical examination and imaging, are consistent with a mycobacterial infection. The culture and biopsy specimens will confirm the diagnosis.

**B: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder** is a less likely diagnosis. This is a type of cancer that can occur after organ transplantation. The patient does not have any of the classic risk factors for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, such as a history of Epstein-Barr virus infection. The patient's symptoms and findings on physical examination and imaging are not consistent with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

**C: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis** is a less likely diagnosis. This is a serious infection that can occur in patients with weakened immune systems. The patient does not have any of the classic risk factors for acute invasive fungal sinusitis, such as a history of cancer or immunosuppressive therapy. The patient's symptoms and findings on physical examination and imaging are not consistent with acute invasive fungal sinusitis.

**D: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma** is a less likely diagnosis. This is a type of cancer that can occur in the nasopharynx. The patient does not have any of the classic risk factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, such as a history of Epstein-Barr virus infection. The patient's symptoms and findings on physical examination and imaging are not consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Title: Generalized Radiopacities of the Craniofacial Skeleton Case is: An adolescent girl presented with a history of multiple, slowly growing masses of the face and head. The lesions were first reported when she was 5 years of age and gradually increased in size. However, her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. On clinical examination, the lesions were hard in consistency with normal overlying skin. There was significant bilateral exophthalmos (the left eye was more pronounced), with visual changes, and dental malocclusion. However, there were no clinical signs of endocrinopathy. A skeletal survey showed no involvement of other bones. The patient’s serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, thyroid, and parathyroid hormone levels were within normal limits. A computed tomographic (CT) examination of the craniofacial skeleton was performed (Figure).Noncontrast axial bone algorithm computed tomographic images of the facial bones.What Is Your Diagnosis?

A computed tomographic (CT) examination of the craniofacial skeleton was performed (Figure).

The CT images show generalized radiopacities of the craniofacial skeleton, with a characteristic "honeycomb" appearance. This is consistent with the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a non-cancerous bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. It can occur in any bone, but is most common in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, and the skull. The cause of fibrous dysplasia is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder.

There is no cure for fibrous dysplasia, but it is usually a benign condition that does not require treatment. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove large or symptomatic lesions.

Title: Facial Pain and Diplopia in a Young Boy Case is: A young boy presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of left facial and eye pain with intermittent diplopia on upward and lateral gaze. He was otherwise healthy and exhibited no constitutional complaints. His remaining medical, surgical, family, and social history was noncontributory. Examination showed a healthy-appearing child with left abducens nerve palsy and an afferent pupillary defect. There was no chemosis, exophthalmos, or enophthalmos. Findings from nasal endoscopy were unremarkable. A computed tomographic scan of the sinuses without contrast showed a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass extending into the orbital apex with smooth, nonaggressive bony remodeling and expansion of the left superior orbital fissure with further dorsal extension into the left cavernous sinus (Figure, A). Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed that orbital component was inseparable from medial rectus muscle. Tumor also resulted in lateral displacement and compression of the left optic nerve (Figure, B). The patient underwent an image-guided left endoscopic orbital decompression with biopsy of the orbital mass. Representative hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections are shown in the Figure, C and D. The tumor was negative for FUS (FUsed in Sarcoma; also termed TLS, Translocated in LipoSarcoma)-CHOP (C/EBP HOmologous Protein; also termed DDIT3, DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 3) fusion oncogene on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).A, Axial cut of noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan of facial bones.

The patient underwent an image-guided left endoscopic orbital decompression with biopsy of the orbital mass. Representative hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections are shown in the figure. The tumor was negative for FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

The differential diagnosis for a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass in a young boy includes lipoblastoma, liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant, and teratoma. Lipoblastoma is a benign lipomatous tumor that typically presents in children under the age of 5 years. It is usually located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region. On imaging, lipoblastomas are typically well-circumscribed and hypodense on computed tomography (CT) scans and hyperintense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Histologically, lipoblastomas are composed of mature adipocytes.

Liposarcoma is a malignant lipomatous tumor that can occur at any age, but it is most common in adults over the age of 50 years. It is typically located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region. On imaging, liposarcomas are typically well-circumscribed but can be infiltrative. They are typically hypodense on CT scans and hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI scans. Histologically, liposarcomas are composed of a variety of different cell types, including adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells.

Pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma is a rare subtype of liposarcoma that typically presents in adults over the age of 50 years. It is typically located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region. On imaging, pleomorphic myxoid liposarcomas are typically well-circumscribed but can be infiltrative. They are typically hypodense on CT scans and hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI scans. Histologically, pleomorphic myxoid liposarcomas are composed of a variety of different cell types, including adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells.

Teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can occur at any age, but it is most common in children under the age of 3 years. It can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the gonads. On imaging, teratomas are typically well-circumscribed but can be infiltrative. They are typically hypodense on CT scans and hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI scans. Histologically, teratomas are composed of a variety of different tissues, including ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.

In the case of the young boy in the question, the most likely diagnosis is lipoblastoma. This is because he is a young boy with a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass that is hypodense on CT scans and hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI scans. Histologically, the tumor is composed of mature adipocytes.

The differential diagnosis for lipoblastoma includes liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant, and teratoma. However, these tumors are less likely in a young boy. Liposarcoma is most common in adults over the age of 50 years. Pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma is a rare subtype of liposarcoma that typically presents in adults over the age of 50 years. Teratoma can occur at any age, but it is most common in children under the age of 3 years.

Title: Ulcerated Nodule of the Fingernail Case is: A woman in her 60s presented with a 2-year history of an abnormal left second fingernail. A previous biopsy showed a pyogenic granuloma, and she had been treated with curettage and electrodessication. In the few months before presentation, she experienced partial nail loss and her nail had become painful with intermittent drainage. Her medical history was significant for streptococcal glomerulonephritis and 2 prior kidney transplants. Her medications included prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Physical examination of the left second fingernail showed a tender ulcerated nodule encompassing the nail bed with near-complete nail loss and purulent drainage (Figure 1, left). A nail biopsy was repeated by performing a 4-mm punch through the nail bed. The specimen was analyzed by histopathology with hematoxylin-eosin staining and once again showed a pyogenic granuloma–like response characterized by proliferating blood vessels in a background of fibrosis and reactive plasmacytic infiltration (Figure 1, right). Careful inspection of the pyogenic granulomatous process at higher power demonstrated atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels.Left, Physical examination of left second fingernail. Right, Histopathologic findings under low-power magnification (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×20).Perform tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organismsWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a history of pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign skin lesion that can be treated with curettage and electrodessication. However, the patient's lesion has recurred and is now painful and draining. In addition, the patient has a history of streptococcal glomerulonephritis and 2 prior kidney transplants, which puts her at increased risk for infection. Given these factors, it is important to rule out infection as the cause of the patient's lesion. This can be done by performing tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms.

Title: Evaluating Thrombocytopenia During Heparin Therapy Case is: A 45-year-old man was hospitalized with abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with superior mesenteric vein thrombosis with mesenteric ischemia and treated with partial small bowel resection and 2 weeks of enoxaparin while hospitalized. Three weeks later, he presented again with abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated fluid collections adjacent to the ascending colon and bowel wall thickening with intestinal pneumatosis consistent with ischemic bowel. Superior mesenteric vein thrombosis was redemonstrated on CT scan. An intravenous course of piperacillin-tazobactam was started, and an exploratory laparotomy with bowel resection was performed. Postoperatively, intravenous heparin was started. One day following surgery, a CT scan demonstrated a new left femoral vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Laboratory data are shown in Table 1.How Would You Interpret These Test Results?

Postoperatively, intravenous heparin was started. One day following surgery, a CT scan demonstrated a new left femoral vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Laboratory data are shown in Table 1.

The patient's platelet count has decreased from 250,000/µL to 100,000/µL. This is a significant decrease and is concerning for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a serious complication of heparin therapy that can lead to life-threatening thrombosis. The diagnosis of HIT is made based on a history of heparin exposure, a platelet count <150,000/µL, and the presence of anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies.

The patient in this case has a history of heparin exposure, a platelet count <150,000/µL, and the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of HIT. The patient should be treated with argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, or lepirudin, a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Heparin should be discontinued.

Title: Nonhealing Leg Ulcer in a Middle-aged Indian Man Case is: A middle-aged man sought treatment for a painful nonhealing foot ulcer of 1-year duration. The lesion had started on the left foot as a painful blister that eventually ruptured to form an ulcer, which subsequently progressed. During this time, multiple hypopigmented asymptomatic lesions appeared on his face and scalp. A diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy was considered previously in another health care facility for which multidrug therapy with rifampicin, 600 mg/mo, dapsone, 100 mg/d, and clofazimine, 50 mg/d, was administered for 6 months. There was no appreciable clinical improvement. On physical examination, an 8 × 6-cm ulcer was noted on the lateral aspect of the dorsum of the left foot (Figure, A). The ulcer was well defined with regular margins, and the floor was covered by a yellowish slough. Perilesional tenderness and pitting edema were observed. Multiple ill-defined, hypopigmented patches of various sizes were present on the scalp and face (Figure, B). Lesional appendages and sensations were preserved. Inguinal lymph nodes on both sides were enlarged, nontender, and movable. Peripheral nerve trunks were not thickened, and peripheral arteries could be easily palpated.

Histologic analysis of the ulcer showed acute ulceration of the epidermis with granulation tissue and infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Histologic analysis of the hypopigmented facial lesion showed intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies.

The most likely diagnosis is **borderline lepromatous leprosy with trophic ulcer**. This is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The disease is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and loss of sensation. The skin lesions can be hypopigmented, erythematous, or nodular. They may be associated with sensory loss, motor weakness, and autonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis of leprosy is made by skin biopsy and/or nerve biopsy. Treatment is with multidrug therapy, which includes rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine.

The differential diagnosis of leprosy includes other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and syphilis. It is important to distinguish leprosy from these other diseases because the treatment is different.

The ulcer is well defined with regular margins, and the floor is covered by a yellowish slough. Perilesional tenderness and pitting edema are observed. Multiple ill-defined, hypopigmented patches of various sizes are present on the scalp and face. Lesional appendages and sensations are preserved. Inguinal lymph nodes on both sides are enlarged, nontender, and movable. Peripheral nerve trunks are not thickened, and peripheral arteries could be easily palpated. Skin punch biopsy specimens were obtained from the ulcer and a hypopigmented facial lesion.

Histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimens shows acute ulceration of the epidermis with granulation tissue and infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies are also noted.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of borderline lepromatous leprosy with trophic ulcer. Borderline leprosy is a form of leprosy in which there is a mixed population of leprosy bacilli (Mycobacterium leprae) in the skin and nerves. The clinical manifestations of borderline leprosy are variable, but typically include hypopigmented or erythematous skin lesions, peripheral nerve damage, and lymphadenopathy. Trophic ulcers are a common complication of leprosy, and they are thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including local ischemia, infection, and nerve damage.

The patient's history of a nonhealing foot ulcer that is associated with multiple hypopigmented lesions on his face and scalp is consistent with a diagnosis of borderline lepromatous leprosy. The histopathologic findings of acute ulceration of the epidermis with granulation tissue and infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, as well as the presence of intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Title: A Strange Digital Tumor Case is: A man in his 60s presented with severe fatigue. His medical history was significant for primary hyperparathyroidism 6 years prior to presentation, for which the patient refused therapeutic management. The patient was cachectic and exhibited significant muscular weakness. Clinical examination revealed a large tumor on the distal part of the right fourth finger (Figure, A) that had gradually enlarged in recent months.

Reasoning:
The patient's history of primary hyperparathyroidism is significant because it is a known cause of brown tumors, which are benign tumors that can occur in the bones. Brown tumors are characterized by the presence of giant cells, which are large cells with multiple nuclei. The patient's laboratory evaluation revealed hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated serum parathyroid hormone, which are all consistent with the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's chest radiograph revealed an important and unexplained deformation of the ribs, which could be a sign of a brown tumor. The histopathological analysis of the tumor revealed numerous giant cells with multiple osteoclastlike nuclei, which is characteristic of a brown tumor.

Title: Hair Loss in a Young Child Case is: A young girl presented for evaluation of hair loss. The mother stated that the patient was born with normal-appearing dark hair that fell out days after birth. This was replaced with “peach fuzz,” with no subsequent regrowth of normal hair. She denied pruritus. Family history was significant for similar hair loss in the patient’s maternal grandmother and maternal cousin. The patient had otherwise normal development. On physical examination, short, brittle terminal hairs of varying lengths covered the entire scalp. Follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema were present, most prominently on the parietal and occipital scalp (Figure, A). Mild perifollicular keratotic papules were noted on the posterior upper arms. Teeth and nails showed no abnormalities. Her eyebrows and lashes were not affected. Results of trichography are shown (Figure, B).Photograph of a young patient with hair loss depicts shortened, thin hairs on the scalp of a child with follicular hyperkeratosis. Light microscopy of hair shaft at 4 × magnification shows a beaded appearance. What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Tinea capitis , B: Psoriasis , C: Monilethrix , D: Menkes disease. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of hair loss that began shortly after birth. The hair loss is not associated with pruritus, and there is no evidence of scalp infection or inflammation. The family history is significant for similar hair loss in the patient's maternal grandmother and maternal cousin. On physical examination, the patient has short, brittle terminal hairs of varying lengths covering the entire scalp. Follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema are present, most prominently on the parietal and occipital scalp. Mild perifollicular keratotic papules are noted on the posterior upper arms. Teeth and nails show no abnormalities. Her eyebrows and lashes are not affected. Results of trichography show shortened, thin hairs with a beaded appearance.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of monilethrix, an inherited disorder of hair shaft fragility. Monilethrix is characterized by short, brittle hairs with a beaded appearance. The hair loss is usually non-progressive and does not affect the eyebrows or lashes. There is no associated pruritus, scalp infection, or inflammation. The diagnosis of monilethrix is made on clinical grounds, with confirmation by light microscopy of the hair shaft.

Title: Abdominal Handlebar Injury Case is: A healthy 6-year-old boy presented to the emergency department after experiencing a bicycle handlebar injury. He complained about abdominal pain and had vomited twice. At physical examination, according to the Advanced Pediatric Life Support protocol, he had normal vitals results with pain during palpation of the left abdominal region without guarding. His hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) (normal value, 10.5-16.1 g/dL), amylase 68 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) (normal value, <85 U/L), and lipase 25 U/L (normal value, <60 U/L). A plain chest radiography result showed no signs of traumatic injury. Abdominal ultrasonography results showed a bowel loop with a thickened wall in the left abdominal region with no free abdominal fluid. He was admitted to the pediatric ward for close observation. The next day, his vomiting persisted, especially after oral intake. Computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast was performed (Figure 1).Computed tomography, axial reconstruction (A) and coronal reconstruction (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast was performed, which showed a thickened bowel loop in the left abdominal region with no free abdominal fluid.

The most likely diagnosis is intramural small bowel hematoma. This is a condition in which there is bleeding within the wall of the small intestine. It is typically caused by trauma, such as the bicycle handlebar injury that this patient sustained. The symptoms of intramural small bowel hematoma include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The treatment of intramural small bowel hematoma is usually supportive, with bed rest and intravenous fluids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the hematoma.

Title: Right Lower Quadrant Pain in Early Pregnancy Case is: A woman in her mid-20s who was 8 weeks pregnant presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain localized in the right iliac fossa (RIF), numbness in the right lower limb, and nausea and vomiting. On examination she had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10 450/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) without any shift, C-reactive protein 1.29 mg/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.331), and hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). The Alvarado score was 7. A transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall (7 mm in the proximal and 11 mm in the appendiceal distal tract). A small amount of free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch. A transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo. Working diagnosis was uncomplicated appendicitis and initial conservative management was amoxicillin clavulanate because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with performing an avoidable appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation. The patient initially improved and was discharged home 2 days later with an Alvarado score of 4; oral antibiotic therapy was continued. Three days later she returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain; the clinical and ultrasonographic findings were unchanged, without evidence of complicated appendicitis, intra-abdominal fluid collection, or abscess. The Alvarado score was 5. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics. In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve, although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic. The surgeon on call requested an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation (Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa (RIF) (A) and what appeared to be an inflamed, thickened appendix (9.83 mm in the proximal appendix) (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her mid-20s who is 8 weeks pregnant. She presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain localized in the right iliac fossa (RIF), numbness in the right lower limb, and nausea and vomiting. On examination she had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10 450/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) without any shift, C-reactive protein 1.29 mg/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.331), and hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10).

The most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with appendicitis, and the imaging findings show a thickened, inflamed appendix. The Alvarado score is a scoring system that is used to predict the likelihood of appendicitis in patients with abdominal pain. A score of 7 or higher has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 91% for appendicitis. The patient's score of 7 is consistent with a diagnosis of appendicitis.

The differential diagnosis for acute appendicitis includes other causes of right lower quadrant pain, such as salpingitis, ovarian cyst, and bowel obstruction. Salpingitis is an infection of the fallopian tubes. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop on the ovaries. Bowel obstruction can occur due to a number of factors, such as hernia, tumor, or inflammation.

The treatment for acute appendicitis is appendectomy. Appendectomy is the surgical removal of the appendix. The procedure is usually performed laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure. The patient is usually discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of surgery.

The prognosis for acute appendicitis is excellent. The vast majority of patients who undergo appendectomy make a full recovery. The risk of complications is low, and the mortality rate is less than 1%.

Title: New-Onset Floaters as Presenting Symptom Case is: A patient in her 50s with a history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes but no blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia. This patient was recently discharged from the hospital for West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis (confirmed seropositive for IgM and IgG antibodies against WNV). Polymerase chain reaction analyses detected no DNA for Epstein-Barr virus, BK virus, cytomegalovirus, or herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Neither HIV antibody nor antigen was detected. Cerebrospinal fluid culture analysis findings were normal. She received supportive treatment and made a full recovery.The patient’s corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, and her intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg OU. Anterior segment examination findings were unremarkable for both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed microaneurysms, a dot-blot hemorrhage, and scattered, deep, white, chorioretinal lesions in the posterior pole and periphery that were more numerous in the right than left eye (Figure 1A). Vitritis was absent. Fluorescein angiography showed chorioretinal lesions with central hypofluorescence and peripheral hyperfluorescence (Figure 1B).A, Deep, white, creamy lesions (arrowheads) are observed in the posterior pole of the right eye. The dot-blot hemorrhage inferior to the fovea is secondary to nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. She recently presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes, but no blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia. She was also recently discharged from the hospital for West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis.

The most likely cause of the patient's floaters is vitreous detachment. Vitreous detachment is a common condition that occurs as people age. It is caused by the vitreous gel, which fills the space between the lens and the retina, shrinking and pulling away from the retina. This can cause floaters, which are small, dark spots or cobweb-like structures that float in the field of vision.

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy increases her risk of developing vitreous detachment. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can damage the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Damage to the retina can lead to floaters, as well as other vision problems, such as blurry vision, dark spots in the vision, and vision loss.

The patient's recent WNV encephalitis is a less likely cause of her floaters. WNV encephalitis is a viral infection of the brain. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. In some cases, WNV encephalitis can also cause vision problems, such as floaters, blurry vision, and vision loss.

The patient's symptoms are most consistent with vitreous detachment. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and mild bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy increases her risk of developing vitreous detachment. The patient's recent WNV encephalitis is a less likely cause of her floaters.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to observe her for a period of time. If the patient's floaters do not resolve or if they are associated with other vision problems, such as blurry vision or vision loss, further testing may be necessary.

Anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed optic nerve head edema and peripapillary hemorrhages bilaterally, greater in the left eye than in the right eye. Scattered peripheral hemorrhages were present, consistent with thrombocytopenia at the time.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes optic neuritis, orbital tumor, and central nervous system lymphoma. Optic neuritis is the most common cause of acute vision loss in children, but it is typically unilateral and does not cause facial palsy or swelling. Orbital tumor is a less common cause of acute vision loss, but it can cause proptosis, eyelid swelling, and diplopia. Central nervous system lymphoma is a rare cause of acute vision loss, but it can cause multiple cranial nerve palsies, including facial palsy.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and brain. MRI is the best imaging modality for evaluating the optic nerves and brain. It can be used to detect optic nerve infiltration, orbital tumors, and central nervous system lymphoma.

Title: A Peripapillary Defect in a Woman With Myopia Case is: A woman in her 60s underwent evaluation of an unusual optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding. She had no ocular complaints. Her ocular history included myopia with a spherical equivalent of −5.50 OD and −4.00 OS, normal-tension glaucoma controlled with latanoprost in both eyes, and mild cataracts. Systemic medical history included use of aspirin, 81 mg/d, and a multivitamin. She frequently consumed alcohol; however, she denied smoking or recreational drug use. She denied any known allergies, and findings of review of systems were unremarkable.Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Extraocular movements were intact, and pupils were round and reactive with no afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure by pneumotonometry was 16 OD mm Hg and 19 mm Hg OS, and visual fields by confrontation were full in both eyes. Anterior segment examination showed 1+ nuclear sclerosis in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed a posterior vitreous detachment and tilted optic nerves with adjacent myopic crescents in both eyes. A small, yellowish orange discontinuity was found in the inferior peripapillary region of the optic conus in the right eye (Figure, A). The macula was flat with a sharp foveal reflex, and the peripheral retina was unremarkable in both eyes.Color fundus photography (A) and optical coherence tomography (B) of peripapillary changes.

**Reasoning:** The patient in this case has a peripapillary defect in the right eye. This is a rare finding that can be caused by a variety of conditions, including myopia, age-related macular degeneration, and posterior vitreous detachment. In this case, the patient has a history of myopia and normal-tension glaucoma, which are both risk factors for peripapillary defects. The patient also has a small, yellowish orange discontinuity in the inferior peripapillary region of the optic conus, which is consistent with a peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation. This is a benign condition that is usually not associated with any visual symptoms. However, in some cases, it can lead to serous macular detachment, which is a serious condition that can cause permanent vision loss.

**Answer:** The best course of action in this case is to order visual field testing and observe closely for serous macular detachment. Visual field testing will help to determine if the patient is experiencing any loss of vision. If the patient does develop serous macular detachment, it can be treated with laser therapy or surgery.

**A. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits:** This is not necessary in this case because the patient has no symptoms that suggest a neurological problem.

**B. Immediately demarcate the region with indirect argon laser barricade:** This is not necessary in this case because the peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation is a benign condition.

**C. Order indocyanine green angiography and photodynamic therapy:** This is not necessary in this case because the peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation is a benign condition.

**D. Order visual field testing and observe closely for serous macular detachment:** This is the best course of action in this case because it will help to determine if the patient is experiencing any loss of vision and allow for early treatment of serous macular detachment if it does occur.

Title: A 70-Year-Old Man With Pain and a Creamy Elevated Lesion After Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation Case is: A 70-year-old man with diabetes and a history of bilateral ocular trauma from a remote gunpowder explosion with resulting bilateral cicatricial lagophthalmos, corneal and conjunctival scarring, and secondary open-angle glaucoma developed persistently elevated intraocular pressures (approximately 30 mm Hg) in the right eye while receiving maximal medical therapy. His baseline visual acuity was count fingers OD. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) was recommended over filtering surgery because of extensive conjunctival scarring and lagophthalmos. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was performed with 19 spots (1300-1500 mW) at 3 seconds each, without audible pops, and sparing the superotemporal quadrant. The day after treatment, the patient was comfortable with an intraocular pressure of 23 mm Hg. Two weeks later, he developed pain and redness while receiving a steroid taper, and examination revealed episcleritis and a small scleral depression temporally. Topical prednisolone therapy was increased; however, during subsequent weeks, his pain intensified.

Title: Hypermetabolic Vocal Cord Focus With Recurrent Oral Cancer History Case is: A woman in her 80s with a history of recurrent oral cancer presented with a new, biopsy-confirmed, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Her oncologic history began 16 years ago with diagnosis and local resection of a lesion on the palate. Cancer recurrence at the left buccal mucosa was identified and excised 10 years later. She then was diagnosed with 3 recurrences of SCC in rapid succession. Each malignant neoplasm was locally resected and the patient was also treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for the last episode. She remained asymptomatic, and a routine surveillance clinical examination uncovered a sixth lesion at the margin of a palatal graft.The patient’s medical history was also noted for a total thyroidectomy in the 1950s, complicated by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. She had a history of tobacco use and stopped smoking cigarettes in the 1970s. Physical examination and laryngoscopy findings confirmed a painless lesion on the left side of the palate and immobility of the left vocal cord. No other mucosal lesion was identified. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed to assess extent of disease and to plan treatment. The PET scan results showed focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 localization within the known oral cavity SCC (Figure 1A) and in a small, level IIA lymph node, located lateral to the upper right internal jugular vein. There was unexpected, prominent, metabolic activity in the medial and asymmetrically enlarged left vocal cord (Figure 1B).A, Positron emission tomography reveals focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in biopsy-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the left palatal graft margin (arrowhead).

Bloodwork revealed a mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase level of 77 U/L (normal level, <41 U/L; to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) and aspartate aminotransferase level of 47 U/L (normal level, <38 U/L; to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167). Cardiac profile showed normal troponin-I levels, mildly elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 142 pg/mL (normal level, <125 pg/mL; to convert to nanograms per liter, multipy by 1), and elevated serum creatine kinase level of 666 U/L (normal level, 20-200 U/L; to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) and creatine kinase–MB fraction level of 10 ng/mL (normal level, <6.7 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Electrocardiogram (ECG) on presentation is shown in Figure 1, which has not changed compared with an ECG a year before presentation. Echocardiography showed global hypokinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%. The right ventricle was moderately dilated with impaired systolic function.

The most likely diagnosis is cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that can cause heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. There are many different types of cardiomyopathy, but the most common type in young adults is dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by enlargement of the left ventricle and a decrease in the ejection fraction. The cause of dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a genetic test to look for mutations in genes that are associated with cardiomyopathy. If a mutation is found, it can help to determine the prognosis of the patient and guide treatment options. If no mutation is found, the patient may need to undergo further testing, such as an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization, to determine the cause of the cardiomyopathy.

Title: Asymptomatic Septal Mass Case is: A woman in her 40s presented with a 2-month history of a slowly enlarging, asymptomatic anterior septal mass. She denied a history of localized trauma, substance abuse, or prior endonasal surgery. Examination revealed a nontender, 8-mm, pink-red, soft, fleshy growth just posterior to the membranous septum near the nostril apex. Histopathological analysis demonstrated a well-circumscribed submucosal lesion comprised of bland, round, syncytial cells, arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized slit-like vascular spaces, a minority of which were staghorn in appearance (Figure, A-C). No significant perivascular hyalinization was identified. The overlying nasal mucosa and surrounding submucosal glands were unremarkable. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the cellular population to be strongly positive for smooth-muscle actin (SMA), muscle-specific actin, and CD34 (Figure, D), but negative for B-catenin and epithelial membrane antigen.Histopathology of asymptomatic septal mass shows (A) a well-circumscribed, unencapsulated lesion based in the submucosa with an intact overlaying squamous and respiratory mucosa (hematoxylin-eosin); (B) bland, vaguely spindled cells arranged around prominent thin-walled vessels with a “staghorn” branching configuration (hematoxylin-eosin); (C) the lesional cells are oval to spindle-shaped with abundant cytoplasm and ill-defined cell borders (hematoxylin-eosin); (D) the lesional cells are stained diffusely with myoid markers, including smooth-muscle actin and muscle-specific actin (muscle-specific actin stain).What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 40s with a 2-month history of a slowly enlarging, asymptomatic anterior septal mass. She denied a history of localized trauma, substance abuse, or prior endonasal surgery. Examination revealed a nontender, 8-mm, pink-red, soft, fleshy growth just posterior to the membranous septum near the nostril apex. Histopathological analysis demonstrated a well-circumscribed submucosal lesion comprised of bland, round, syncytial cells, arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized slit-like vascular spaces, a minority of which were staghorn in appearance. No significant perivascular hyalinization was identified. The overlying nasal mucosa and surrounding submucosal glands were unremarkable. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the cellular population to be strongly positive for smooth-muscle actin (SMA), muscle-specific actin, and CD34, but negative for B-catenin and epithelial membrane antigen.

The differential diagnosis for a submucosal lesion of the nasal septum includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign lesions are inflammatory polyps, fibromas, and myxomas. The most common malignant lesions are squamous cell carcinomas, sarcomas, and lymphomas.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathological findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of myofibroma. Myofibromas are benign mesenchymal tumors that are composed of bland, spindle-shaped cells arranged in a storiform or fascicular pattern. They are often associated with prominent vascularity. Myofibromas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region.

The histopathological findings in this case are characteristic of myofibroma. The lesion is well-circumscribed and composed of bland, spindle-shaped cells arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized slit-like vascular spaces. The cells are positive for smooth-muscle actin, muscle-specific actin, and CD34, which are all markers of smooth muscle differentiation. The cells are negative for B-catenin and epithelial membrane antigen, which are markers of epithelial differentiation.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is myofibroma.

Histopathological analysis of the tongue lesion shows (A) sheet-like growth pattern with Azzopardi-type crush artifactual distortion of the neoplastic cells (original magnification ×100) (the insert shows round-oval compact molded nuceli, a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, and granular chromatin pattern without conspicuous nucleoli [original magnification ×400]); B, cytokeratin 7–positive immunoreactivity (original magnification ×200); C, synaptophysin-positive tumor cells (original magnification ×200); and D, a high proliferation rate by Ki-67 staining (original magnification ×200).

The most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, including his age, sex, and tobacco history; the histopathological findings, including the presence of sheets and clusters of small round-oval uniform cells with minimal cytoplasm, granular chromatin pattern, and prominent nuclear molding; and the positive immunoreactivity for CK 7 and synaptophysin. The patient's weight loss is likely due to his dysphagia and the tumor's obstruction of his airway.

The differential diagnosis includes other types of carcinoma, such as small cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. However, these are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and the histopathological findings.

Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The patient's prognosis will depend on the stage of his disease at the time of diagnosis.

Title: Cerebrospinal Fluid Rhinorrhea and a Lytic-Appearing Lesion of the Posterior Cranial Fossa Case is: A man in his 60s presented to the otolaryngology clinic with a 1-month history of clear drainage from his left naris during activity. Approximately 1 month prior he had been admitted to the hospital and treated for meningitis. During his hospital course, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of his head revealed a lytic lesion of the left occipital bone. After treatment with intravenous antibiotics and steroids, his neurologic examination results returned to baseline, and he was discharged home. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was deferred to the outpatient setting. At the otolaryngologist’s office, the patient stated that he had not experienced otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus, or vertigo. His examination revealed clear nasal discharge and a normal otoscopic finding. His audiogram demonstrated normal sloping to moderate sensorineural hearing loss with type A tympanometry result on the right and type A on the left. His word recognition score was 100% bilaterally. The collection of nasal discharge for β-2 transferrin analysis was attempted, but insufficient quantity was obtained. To evaluate for a skull base defect and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, a noncontrast CT scan of the temporal bones was obtained (Figure, A and B). This demonstrated a large area of bony destruction and osteolysis involving the left occipital bone. A T2-weighted MRI sequence showed a lesion, isointense to CSF, with thinning of the bony cortex (Figure, C and D). Based on the imaging, the differential diagnosis included metabolic, infectious, or metastatic lesions to the bone.A and B, Noncontrast temporal bone computed tomographic images.

Based on the imaging, the differential diagnosis included metabolic, infectious, or metastatic lesions to the bone.

The most likely diagnosis is a meningoencephalocele. A meningoencephalocele is a protrusion of the meninges and brain through a defect in the skull. It is most commonly seen in the occipital region, as in this case. The patient's history of meningitis and the presence of a lytic lesion on imaging are consistent with this diagnosis.

Other possible diagnoses include multiple myeloma, Paget disease, and fibrous dysplasia. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and imaging findings.

Reasoning:
The patient in this case has a number of clinical features that are suggestive of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and impaired platelet function. HPS is caused by mutations in the HPS1 gene, which encodes a protein called HPS1. HPS1 is involved in the production of a protein called thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), which is important for platelet aggregation and hemostasis. Patients with HPS have reduced levels of TSP-1, which leads to impaired platelet function and a bleeding diathesis.
The patient in this case also has a history of cutaneous melanoma, which is a risk factor for HPS. In addition, the patient's family history is consistent with HPS, as her mother and sister have also been diagnosed with the disorder.
Given the patient's clinical presentation and history, it is important to order molecular genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of HPS. Molecular genetic testing can be performed on a blood sample to detect mutations in the HPS1 gene.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign vascular tumor that is often associated with trauma. Pyogenic granulomas are typically small, red, and pedunculated lesions that can ulcerate. They are usually found on the hands and feet, and they are more common in women.

The patient's history of a rapidly enlarging, tender nodule on her finger is consistent with a pyogenic granuloma. The physical examination findings of a single, firm, dome-shaped subcutaneous nodule with central ulceration on the lateral aspect of the right fifth digit are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a biopsy of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of a subcutaneous nodule, such as a soft tissue neoplasm or a metastasis from a distant cancer.

Reasoning:
The patient is a toddler with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and juvenile xanthogranulomas who presents with an eruption on his trunk that began 2 months previously with multiple round red patches that have been slowly increasing in size. Treatment with griseofulvin and clotrimazole has not improved the rash. One day prior to presentation he had developed a fever and was diagnosed with otitis media in the emergency department. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin were used for treatment, but the child was receiving no other medications.

Physical examination revealed multiple annular, indurated, dusky red plaques with central clearing and trailing scale ranging from 1 to 6 cm in diameter on his trunk. A 4-mm punch biopsy of the largest lesion on his back was performed and sent for histopathologic examination.

The histopathologic examination showed a perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional eosinophils. The diagnosis was granuloma annulare.

Granuloma annulare is a common skin disorder characterized by annular, indurated plaques with central clearing. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder.

The treatment of granuloma annulare is generally not necessary, as the lesions often resolve spontaneously within a few months to a year. However, if the lesions are cosmetically unacceptable or if they are causing symptoms such as itching or pain, treatment may be indicated. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral steroids, and phototherapy.

In this case, the patient's history of NF1 and juvenile xanthogranulomas is significant, as these are both conditions that are associated with an increased risk of developing granuloma annulare. The patient's presentation is also consistent with granuloma annulare, as he has multiple annular, indurated plaques with central clearing. The histopathologic examination showed a perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional eosinophils, which is also consistent with granuloma annulare.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is granuloma annulare.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of essential thrombocytosis who presents with a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on her hands and forearms, as well as an enlarging, painful ulcer on her left leg that developed 6 months earlier. Her medical history is also notable for portal vein thrombosis. She has been receiving treatment with hydroxyurea and rivaroxaban for the past 2 years. Despite worsening cutaneous disease, she otherwise feels well and denies associated fevers, weakness, weight loss, myalgias, arthralgias, or other constitutional symptoms.

On physical examination, the patient has atrophic and reticulated violaceous plaques with a striking photoaccentuated distribution on the dorsal hands and forearms. Scaly, violaceous plaques are also present on the thenar eminences and radial aspects of her first 2 fingers bilaterally. Prominent poikiloderma is seen on her sun-exposed chest and neck, and a large, stellate ulcer is present on her left distal lower leg. A lesional skin biopsy was performed on the patient's left forearm.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's cutaneous eruption includes cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis, hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption, and polyarteritis nodosa.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. The most common cutaneous manifestation of lupus is a malar rash, which is a butterfly-shaped rash that occurs on the cheeks and bridge of the nose. Other cutaneous manifestations of lupus can include photosensitivity, discoid lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis is a rare complication of essential thrombocytosis that can occur in up to 10% of patients. The cutaneous lesions associated with this condition are typically small, red or purple papules or nodules that occur on the sun-exposed areas of the skin.

Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption is a rare side effect of hydroxyurea, a medication that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including essential thrombocytosis. The cutaneous lesions associated with this condition are typically symmetrical, scaly, violaceous plaques that occur on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs.

Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can affect any artery in the body. The cutaneous lesions associated with polyarteritis nodosa are typically small, red or purple papules or nodules that occur on the extremities.

The most likely diagnosis for the patient's cutaneous eruption is cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of essential thrombocytosis, the presence of photodistributed, atrophic and reticulated violaceous plaques on the dorsal hands and forearms, and the absence of other systemic features.

Title: Generalized Net-like Erythema and Stroke in a Young Female Case is: A woman in her 40s presented with a 4-hour history of ataxia and left-sided hemidysesthesia. Annular patches of violaceous erythema forming an irregular net-like pattern were noted on her trunk and extremities (Figure, A and B). The patient stated that these skin changes had appeared 2 years prior. Her medical history was significant for 5 strokes over the past 6 years and Raynaud syndrome for the past 2 years. In the past, despite extensive workup, no definitive diagnosis had been established. Complete blood cell count, liver function tests, creatinine, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and urinalysis results were normal. Antinuclear antibodies and complement C3 and C4 levels were unremarkable. Antiphospholipid antibody and lupus anticoagulant screening results were repeatedly negative and no evidence of thrombophilia was found. Magnetic resonance imaging showed acute dot-like diffusion anomalies in the medial and posterior cerebral artery-supplied areas, as well as old stroke residues (Figure, C). Transesophageal echocardiography showed no abnormalities. A skin biopsy sample was taken from the patient’s left thigh (Figure, D).A, Patient’s lower back and buttocks and, B, thighs and upper calves show generalized, irregular, violaceous, net-like erythema. C, Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing old stroke residues. D, Hematoxylin-eosin stain (original magnification ×10).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Cervical spine imaging results were negative. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) study results were unremarkable (red blood cell count, 0 × 106/µL [to convert to ×1012/L, multiply by 12]; white blood cell count, 0/µL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]; glucose, 61 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]; and total protein, 19 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]), and CSF cytologic test results were negative for malignancy. Oligoclonal bands and IgG index were not measured. The results of serum cell-based aquaporin 4 antibody tests were negative. She was diagnosed with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and received 5 days of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids followed by a 1-month course of oral prednisone with improvement back to baseline in 3 weeks.Brain magnetic resonance imaging during initial presentation: T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe (A) and associated enhancement on T1-weighted postcontrast imaging (B). Brain magnetic resonance imaging during second attack: resolution of the initial left frontal lobe lesion now with T2-weighted and FLAIR recovery hyperintensity in the left parietotemporal region (C) with associated patchy enhancement (D).She presented again, 15 months later, with 2 weeks of dysarthria and progressive ataxia without change in mental status. Subsequent brain MRI revealed resolution of the prior supratentorial involvement and new T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes with patchy enhancement in the brainstem and a large new lesion in the left parietotemporal area (Figure, C and D). Head magnetic resonance angiography findings were unremarkable. The CSF studies revealed a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (white blood cell count of 11/µL with 3 neutrophils, 6 lymphocytes, and 2 monocytes) with 1 red blood cell, glucose level of 57 mg/dL, and total protein level of 39 g/dL. The results of the CSF viral polymerase chain reaction studies, including cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus, were negative. The CSF bacterial culture returned without growth. The results of tests for the CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index were negative. The patient received pulse dose corticosteroids (intravenous solumedrol, 30 mg/kg per dose every 24 hours) for 5 days with resolution of her truncal ataxia during hospitalization. She was discharged with a month-long oral prednisone taper starting at 20 mg/d. When tapered down to prednisone, 5 mg every other day, she developed a right facial droop with recurrent ataxia.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Multiple sclerosis , B: Central nervous system lymphoma , C: Autoimmune encephalitis , D: Neurosarcoidosis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a young girl with a history of recurrent demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The lesions are characterized by T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity with associated patchy enhancement on T1-weighted postcontrast imaging. The patient also has a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The disease is characterized by the development of multiple demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. This damage can lead to a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, tingling, vision problems, and problems with balance and coordination.

The diagnosis of MS is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The clinical findings that are most suggestive of MS include a history of two or more demyelinating attacks that occur in different parts of the CNS, with an interval of at least one month between attacks. Laboratory tests that can be used to support the diagnosis of MS include the measurement of CSF oligoclonal bands and the IgG index. Imaging studies, such as brain MRI, can be used to identify demyelinating lesions in the CNS.

There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment options include corticosteroids, disease-modifying therapies, and symptomatic therapies. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Disease-modifying therapies are used to slow the progression of the disease. Symptomatic therapies are used to treat specific symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, and bladder problems.

The prognosis for patients with MS varies depending on the severity of the disease. Some patients have a mild form of the disease that is well-controlled with treatment. Others have a more severe form of the disease that progresses rapidly and leads to significant disability.

Title: Rapidly Changing Skin Lesion in a Teenage Boy Case is: A 16-year-old boy presented with a changing skin lesion on his right lower back. The patient reported the presence of a stable red lesion since he was 7 years old; however, over the preceding month, this lesion developed new black spots within it. There was no associated pain, pruritus, or bleeding. His family history was notable for dysplastic nevus syndrome in his father and melanoma in a paternal uncle and cousin.On examination of the right lower back, there was a cluster of 1-mm flat purple-black papules coalescing into a 1.5 × 1.0-cm oval plaque with surrounding erythema (Figure, A). On reinspection of the lesion at a subsequent visit, the morphology had significantly changed; there were 1-mm skin-colored to pink thin-walled vesicles clustered within a 1.5 × 1.0-cm oval telangiectatic plaque (Figure, B).A, Flat purple-black papules coalescing into an oval patch with surrounding erythema.

Reasoning: The patient is a 16-year-old boy who presented with a changing skin lesion on his right lower back. The lesion was originally a stable red lesion that developed new black spots within it over the preceding month. There was no associated pain, pruritus, or bleeding. The patient's family history is notable for dysplastic nevus syndrome in his father and melanoma in a paternal uncle and cousin.

On examination, there was a cluster of 1-mm flat purple-black papules coalescing into a 1.5 × 1.0-cm oval plaque with surrounding erythema. On reinspection of the lesion at a subsequent visit, the morphology had significantly changed; there were 1-mm skin-colored to pink thin-walled vesicles clustered within a 1.5 × 1.0-cm oval telangiectatic plaque.

The differential diagnosis for a rapidly changing skin lesion includes melanoma, angiokeratoma, and mastocytoma. Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. It is the most common type of skin cancer and the most serious, with the potential to metastasize to other organs. Angiokeratoma is a benign vascular lesion that is characterized by small, red or purple papules. Mastocytoma is a benign skin lesion that is characterized by a raised, red or purple papule or plaque.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of melanoma. The presence of a changing skin lesion in a young patient with a family history of melanoma is highly suspicious for melanoma. The initial appearance of the lesion as a stable red papule that developed new black spots within it is consistent with the radial growth phase of melanoma. The subsequent change in the morphology of the lesion to a cluster of skin-colored to pink thin-walled vesicles is consistent with the vertical growth phase of melanoma.

The diagnosis of melanoma is confirmed by biopsy. The treatment of melanoma depends on the stage of the disease. Early-stage melanoma is typically treated with surgery. Advanced-stage melanoma may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 40-year-old man with a 3-month history of a right breast mass slowly enlarging with associated pain. The patient denied history of local trauma, and his family history was negative regarding breast or ovarian cancers. The patient had no history of liver disease, hormonal therapy, or radiation to the chest wall. The physical examination disclosed an obese man with no signs of hypogonadism or liver failure. There was a 3 × 4-cm hard, irregular, mobile nodule in the retroareolar area of the right breast, tethered to the overlying skin but not fixed to the underlying muscle. There were no other masses on the chest wall. The ipsilateral lymph nodes were palpable. The left breast and axilla were normal. Right mediolateral oblique mammography (Figure, A) and computed tomography scan of the chest (Figure, B) are shown.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is carcinoma. The patient is a man with a breast mass, which is unusual. The mass is hard, irregular, and mobile, which are features of carcinoma. The mass is tethered to the overlying skin, which suggests that it is invasive. The lymph nodes in the axilla are palpable, which is a sign of metastasis. The mammography and computed tomography scan show a mass in the right breast that involves the skin but not the pectoralis muscle. These findings are consistent with carcinoma.

Title: A Rare Cause of Small-Bowel Ischemia Case is: A 68-year-old African American man presented to the emergency department with 72 hours of progressively worsening diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis. He was previously healthy and had no prior abdominal operations. The patient noted pencil-thin stools that occurred during the past several months but had not had a colonoscopy in more than a decade. The rest of his history was noncontributory. He was mildly tachycardic but normotensive and afebrile. Physical examination revealed a lethargic patient with a distended abdomen, diffuse rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding. No surgical scars or inguinal hernias were apparent on examination. The only abnormal laboratory values were as follows: sodium concentration, 126 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); lactate concentration, 58.6 mg/dL (reference range, 0-18.0 mg/dL) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.111); and white blood cell count, 18 500/μL (reference range, 3400-10 000/μL) (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). He was resuscitated with 2 L of lactated Ringer solution and underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. Computed tomography revealed diffuse free fluid but without free air and several loops of dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls. The mesentery was markedly edematous (Figure). The rest of the small bowel were dilated and air and fluid filled but had normal bowel wall enhancement. The colon was normal.Axial computed tomography image of the abdomen and pelvis.

Computed tomography reveals diffuse free fluid but without free air and several loops of dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls. The mesentery is markedly edematous. The rest of the small bowel are dilated and air and fluid filled but had normal bowel wall enhancement. The colon is normal.

The most likely diagnosis is superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism (SMAT). SMAT is a rare but serious condition that occurs when a blood clot blocks the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies blood to the small intestine. This can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the small bowel. The classic presentation of SMAT is abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination may reveal a distended abdomen with tenderness and guarding. Laboratory findings may include leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and acidosis. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scan or angiography, can confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of SMAT is prompt surgical intervention to restore blood flow to the small intestine. This may involve embolectomy or bypass surgery. Patients who do not receive prompt treatment are at high risk of death.

Title: A Neonate With Acute Dacryocystitis Case is: A 7-day-old healthy infant, born at 38 weeks by spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications, presented to the emergency department with a new-onset enlarging erythematous mass overlying her right medial lower eyelid (Figure 1). The infant’s mother reported a small blue bump present at birth near the medial canthus. Otherwise, the infant was stable, nontoxic appearing on examination, and feeding well. The patient was admitted for broad-spectrum intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for treatment of acute dacryocystitis with overlying preseptal cellulitis. The admitting team collected a complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and blood cultures and performed a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the results of which were within normal limits. A maxillofacial computed tomographic scan was also obtained by the admitting service owing to concerns over displacement of the right globe (Figure 1). The patient continued treatment with intravenous antibiotics and on day 2 of admission, ophthalmology was consulted. A bedside beveled percutaneous needle drainage was performed with a 25-gauge syringe. The lacrimal sac was decompressed and 3 mL of purulent discharge was aspirated. By day 3 of admission, the edema and preseptal cellulitis had improved.External appearance of the right eye (A) with adjacent coronal maxillofacial computed tomographic scan on admission (B).

Results of examination of her fundus are shown in the Figure, A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed diffuse abnormalities on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences (Figure, B).

The patient's presentation is concerning for multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, weakness, vision problems, and problems with balance and coordination.

The patient's history of chronic migraines is a risk factor for MS. The headaches that she is experiencing are also consistent with MS. The numbness, tingling, and weakness that she is experiencing are also concerning for MS. The MRI findings are also consistent with MS.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It can be tested for the presence of MS lesions.

If the lumbar puncture results are positive for MS, the patient will need to be started on treatment. There are a number of different medications that are available for the treatment of MS. These medications can help to slow the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses.

Title: Retina Folds and Subretinal Fluid After Bell Palsy Case is: A woman in her late 20s presented with blurry vision in both eyes of 2-week duration. Her ocular history included optic neuropathy 5 years prior to presentation. Her medical history included acute lymphocytic leukemia (currently in remission) after an allogenic hematopoetic stem cell transplant. Two months before presentation, she developed Bell palsy on the right side of her face for which she was being treated with oral prednisone; her other medications were oral contraceptives and multivitamins. As her Bell palsy was improving, she noted worsening of her visual acuity. Her best-corrected visual acuity was hand motion OD and 20/400 OS. Tensions were 12 mm Hg bilaterally. A slitlamp examination revealed normal anterior segments in each eye. The vitreous was free of cells in each eye. A dilated ophthalmoscopic examination revealed mild optic nerve pallor (associated with her past episodes of optic neuritis) (Figure). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated no leakage.Color fundus photograph of the right eye showing a pale nerve and mildly dilated and tortuous veins.Ask the patient to taper the oral prednisone and reassure her that the symptoms will gradually resolveAdminister intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agentWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient's history of optic neuropathy and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in remission after an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) puts her at risk for developing posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare, but potentially devastating, disorder that can cause seizures, headaches, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. It is thought to be caused by vasogenic edema in the brain, and it is often associated with use of certain medications, including steroids.

In this case, the patient's presentation of blurry vision in both eyes of 2-week duration, as well as her past episodes of optic neuritis, is concerning for PRES. Her best-corrected visual acuity of hand motion OD and 20/400 OS is also consistent with PRES. The dilated ophthalmoscopic examination revealed mild optic nerve pallor (associated with her past episodes of optic neuritis) and retinal folds and subretinal fluid (which are both findings that can be seen in PRES). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated no leakage, which is helpful in ruling out other causes of her visual symptoms, such as retinal detachment.

Given the patient's history and presentation, it is important to rule out PRES as the cause of her visual symptoms. The next step in management would be to order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture to assess for the presence of vasogenic edema. If PRES is diagnosed, treatment would include discontinuation of the offending medication (in this case, oral prednisone) and supportive care, such as blood pressure control and seizure management.

Title: Acute Bilateral Eyelid Edema in a 3-Year-Old Girl With Pyuria Case is: A 3-year-old Asian girl presented to the emergency department with high fever (>40°C) of 2 days’ duration, bilateral upper and lower eyelid edema, and dysuria. Results of urinalysis revealed pyuria, and she was prescribed oral cephalexin, 250 mg every 12 hours, for a presumed urinary tract infection. The patient returned 2 days later with persistent fever, worsening eyelid edema, and a new macular rash over her buttocks and shins. At this time, the ophthalmology service was consulted owing to concern for Stevens-Johnson syndrome precipitated by the treatment with cephalexin.On examination, her visual acuity was central, steady, and maintained in each eye. Motility and pupil reactions were normal. There was moderate edema of the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally with erythema and several areas of shallow ulceration that were weeping a yellowish serous discharge (Figure, A). This type of edema was associated with moderate hyperemia of the palpebral conjunctiva (Figure, B). Results of the ocular surface examination revealed minimal bulbar conjunctival injection, the cornea was clear, and there was no discharge. Cephalexin was discontinued, the patient was admitted, and a diagnostic workup was initiated, including swabs from the eyelid lesions and conjunctiva for bacterial cultures and viral polymerase chain reaction testing. Results of blood laboratory testing revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an elevated level of C-reactive protein, as well as elevated liver enzymes.On initial evaluation, the patient displayed bilateral eyelid edema and erythema with multiple areas of shallow ulceration (A) and moderate palpebral conjunctival hyperemia (B).Start corticosteroid eyedrops and check daily for pseudomembrane formationPerform Tzanck smear on swab from ulcerated lesionInstitute contact precautions and prescribe mupirocin ointment to eyelid skinWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: (C) Perform Tzanck smear on swab from ulcerated lesion.

Reasoning:

A Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test that can be used to identify the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including those that are similar to the lesions that the patient in this case is experiencing. A Tzanck smear involves scraping a sample of the lesion and then staining it with a special dye. If HSV is present, the cells in the sample will show characteristic changes under the microscope.

Performing a Tzanck smear in this case is important because it can help to confirm the diagnosis of HSV. This is important because HSV is a treatable infection, and early treatment can help to prevent the development of more serious complications. In addition, knowing that the patient has HSV can help to guide the management of her condition. For example, patients with HSV should avoid contact with people who are immunocompromised, as they are at an increased risk of developing serious complications from the infection.

Title: Sudden Flank Pain in a Patient Receiving Ibrutinib for Mantle Cell Lymphoma Case is: A woman in her 50s presented to the emergency department with acute, severe, left flank pain. There was no medical history of trauma, fever, or hematuria. She was receiving therapy for mantle cell lymphoma and had previously undergone 1 cycle of the Nordic protocol (comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone, cytarabine, and rituximab).1 However, this resulted in tumor lysis syndrome and neutropenic sepsis. The patient was reluctant to undergo further infusional therapy and was switched to ibrutinib, 560 mg, once daily. During the 2-month period that she was receiving ibrutinib therapy, there were no concurrent administrations of anticoagulants. At presentation, she was hypotensive (blood pressure, 79/45 mm Hg) with conjunctival pallor and left renal angle tenderness. The patient’s hemoglobin count was low (7.6 g/dL; reference range, 12-16 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), which represented a significant decrease from the baseline (10.6 g/dL) measured 1 month before presentation. She was also found to have acute-onset thrombocytopenia (40×109/L; reference range, 140-400×109/L) and leukocytosis (12.75×109/L, reference range, 4-10×109/L). Her coagulation profile (prothrombin time) was normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed (Figure 1A) and compared with a similar scan performed 4 months prior (Figure 1B).

Gated cardiac CT angiogram confirms mobile hypoattenuating masses on the mitral valve leaflets that prolapsed to the left atrium during systole. No myocardial, pulmonary vein, or pericardial involvement was seen.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic disease to the heart, specifically the mitral and tricuspid valves. The masses seen on the echocardiogram are consistent with metastatic tumor. The patient's history of lung cancer, the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules, and the brain metastases all support this diagnosis.

The next step in management is to refer the patient for surgical valve replacement. This is the only way to remove the metastatic tumor from the heart and prevent further complications, such as heart failure or stroke. The patient should also be treated with full-dose anticoagulation to prevent further emboli. Chemotherapy is not indicated in this case, as it is unlikely to be effective against metastatic lung cancer.

Title: Unilateral Nasal Obstruction Case is: A woman in her 30s presented with a 7-month history of right-sided nasal obstruction. She had been treated with several courses of oral antibiotics and intranasal steroids without improvement of symptoms. She had no history of sinus infections or allergic rhinitis. Nasal obstruction was constant and associated with right paranasal pressure. Results from a head and neck examination, including cranial nerve, were normal, except for the results from nasal endoscopy, which showed a deviated septum and a soft-tissue mass emanating from the right middle meatus inferior to the middle turbinate that seemed to have a polypoid appearance superiorly and a papillomatous appearance inferiorly. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the sinuses without contrast showed complete opacification of the right paranasal sinuses with mass effect on the medial maxillary wall with mild hyperostosis posterolaterally. The patient underwent an endoscopic right sinonasal mass biopsy. Intraoperatively, further excision of the mass was aborted owing to an unusual appearance of the mass as well as clear fluid exuding from the mass during microdebridement. Pathologic analysis of the biopsied tissue revealed a uniform spindle cell tumor comprised of cellular fascicles and tumor cells with bland nuclei (Figure, A and B). A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the face with contrast was obtained postoperatively to further delineate the mass and evaluate for intracranial extension. Initial histologic stains showed the tumor to be positive for S-100 and actin (Figure, C and D) and negative for GFAP, CD34, and cytokeratin. Additional immunostains showed the tumor to be negative for SOX-10 and B-catenin.Histopathologic images. A and B, Hematoxylin-eosin. C, S-100 immunohistochemical stain.

Additional immunostains showed the tumor to be negative for SOX-10 and B-catenin.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcomas are rare, aggressive tumors that arise from the sinonasal mucosa. They are typically composed of a mixture of spindle cells and epithelial cells, and they can be positive for both S-100 and actin. Other possible diagnoses include solitary fibrous tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and synovial sarcoma. However, these tumors are less likely based on the patient's presentation.

Answer:

The correct answer is A. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Title: Aggressive-Appearing Pediatric Parotid Mass Case is: A young boy presented with a 4-week history of an enlarging right facial mass, which had not responded to a course of azithromycin prescribed by his pediatrician. He had a history of asthma, chronic otitis media with effusion, and obstructive sleep apnea and had undergone 3 sets of tympanostomy tubes and an adenotonsillectomy. He had no history of fevers or other constitutional symptoms. Physical examination demonstrated a 3-cm firm and tender right parotid mass. Clear saliva could be expressed from the Stensen duct. A computed tomographic (CT) scan was performed, showing a discrete 2 × 2-cm necrotic mass in the right parotid gland (Figure, A). A fine-needle aspirate (FNA) yielded a cellular sample with spindloid features, suggesting a neoplasm of uncertain subtype. A broad differential diagnosis was raised, including both benign and malignant salivary neoplasms. Per recommendation of the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board, the patient underwent total parotidectomy and neck dissection because the mass was grossly infiltrative of the parotid, and several enlarged level IB and II lymph nodes were observed at the time of surgery. The mass was shaved off the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve because it was adherent to it. Permanent histopathologic images showed normal parotid gland architecture effaced by confluent granulomata with Langhans-type giant cells and central necrosis (Figure, B). Additional studies, including flow cytometry and tissue cultures, were obtained.A, Coronal computed tomographic (CT) image demonstrating right parotid mass and level II adenopathy.

The most likely diagnosis is histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (HNL). HNL is a rare, non-neoplastic inflammatory condition that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas in lymph nodes and other tissues. The granulomas are composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Central necrosis is often present. HNL is a self-limiting condition that usually resolves within a few months. However, in some cases, it can be chronic or recurrent.

The differential diagnosis for HNL includes other granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and fungal infections. However, these conditions can be distinguished from HNL by their clinical features, laboratory findings, and histopathologic features.

The treatment of HNL is usually supportive. Corticosteroid therapy may be used to reduce inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected lymph nodes.

The prognosis for HNL is generally good. The vast majority of patients recover completely without any long-term sequelae.

Title: Worsening Respiratory Distress in a 7-Month-Old Infant Case is: A 7-month-old infant presented to the otolaryngology clinic for noisy breathing. His noisy breathing had been present since birth, constant, exacerbated with feeding, sleeping, and supine positioning. He fed poorly from the bottle with frequent choking, grunting, and irritability, and had minimal weight gain with 1 cyanotic event while feeding. His medical history was significant for prematurity, born at 26 weeks, and a 60-day intubation during a 99-day neonatal intensive care unit stay. The physical examination was remarkable only for biphasic stridor and a weak cry. Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy showed no laryngomalacia, laryngeal lesions, or cord paralysis.Shortly after this visit, the patient presented to the emergency department with increased work of breathing, tachypnea, retractions, weak cry, and stridor. Examination was significant for subcostal retractions, and biphasic stridor. Due to a lack of response to racemic epinephrine, albuterol, and steroids, he was admitted to the intensive care unit for heliox and intravenous steroids, resulting in mild improvements. A viral panel was positive for rhinovirus. A few days later he was taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy.During sedation, a prolonged expiratory phase with quick chest wall rise on inspiration and slow fall with expiration was observed. Capnography showed a restrictive “shark fin” waveform (Figure, A). The direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed (Figure, C and D).Images show the (A) preintervention and (B) postintervention capnography wave form as seen on the anesthesia monitor. Endoscopy images on (C) expiration and (D) inspiration.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Laryngotracheitis (croup) , B: Subglottic cyst , C: Subglottic stenosis , D: Subglottic hemangioma.

Reasoning: The patient's history of prematurity and a 60-day intubation during a 99-day neonatal intensive care unit stay is significant for the development of subglottic stenosis. Subglottic stenosis is a narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords that can occur in infants and children who have been intubated. The narrowing can be caused by inflammation, scarring, or both. Symptoms of subglottic stenosis include stridor, a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing, and respiratory distress. The diagnosis of subglottic stenosis is made with a laryngoscopy, a procedure in which a doctor looks at the larynx with a scope. Treatment for subglottic stenosis may include steroids, surgery, or a combination of both.

Answer: C. Subglottic stenosis

Title: Erythematous, Burning and Painful Scrotal Nodules Case is: A man in his 60s presented with a 3-month history of intertrigo involving his groin that he had been treating with a combination of clotrimazole cream, 1%, and hydrocortisone cream, 1%. His intertrigo improved, but he then developed bright red, burning and painful nodules around his scrotum (Figure 1). His medical history included prostate cancer, hypertension, anxiety disorder, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and diverticulosis. His medications included omeprazole, alprazolam, amlodipine besylate, atenolol, simvastatin, and valsartan. On physical examination, there were 2 symmetrical solitary erythematous nodules in the right and left inguinal folds adjacent to the scrotum.Clinical image of well-demarcated erythematous solitary papule in the right inguinal fold.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

A deep fungal infection is unlikely because the patient had been treated with clotrimazole cream, which is an antifungal medication. Cutaneous malakoplakia is also unlikely because it is a rare condition that is usually seen in older adults with chronic renal failure. Granular cell tumor is a benign tumor that can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the hands, feet, and face. Metastatic prostate cancer is the most likely diagnosis because the patient has a history of prostate cancer and the nodules are located in the inguinal folds, which are a common site for metastatic prostate cancer.

Title: Corymbiform Lesions in a Young Healthy Man Case is: A previously healthy man in his 30s was referred to our department for evaluation of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions that had been present for 4 months. He had been treated with a course of high-potency topical corticosteroids without any improvement. Physical examination revealed annular red plaques with scale and superficial erosions over the trunk and extremities. Strikingly, plaques on both arms showed a corymbiform pattern, with a central and multiple satellite lesions (Figure, A). On the lower limbs, infiltrated plaques with prominent crusts were seen (Figure, B). Also, there were papulosquamous lesions on the left sole, but the palms were spared. The genital area was not involved. There was neither regional lymph node enlargement nor systemic involvement. Two biopsy specimens from both types of lesions were obtained for histopathologic evaluation, showing an identical histologic pattern (Figure, C and D).What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a previously healthy man in his 30s with asymptomatic cutaneous lesions that have been present for 4 months. He has been treated with a course of high-potency topical corticosteroids without any improvement. Physical examination reveals annular red plaques with scale and superficial erosions over the trunk and extremities.

Also, there were papulosquamous lesions on the left sole, but the palms were spared. The genital area was not involved. There was neither regional lymph node enlargement nor systemic involvement. Two biopsy specimens from both types of lesions were obtained for histopathologic evaluation, showing an identical histologic pattern.

The most likely diagnosis is psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by the rapid growth of skin cells. This leads to the buildup of thick, red, scaly patches of skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most common on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.

The characteristic corymbiform pattern of the lesions is a clue to the diagnosis of psoriasis. Corymbiform lesions are annular plaques with a central clearing and multiple satellite lesions. This pattern is thought to be caused by the centrifugal growth of psoriatic plaques.

The histopathologic findings of psoriasis are also characteristic. Psoriatic skin is thickened and shows increased mitotic activity in the epidermis. There is also parakeratosis, which is the retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum.

The treatment of psoriasis depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases can be treated with topical corticosteroids or calcipotriene. More severe cases may require systemic therapy with oral medications such as methotrexate or acitretin.

Title: Coalescing Subcutaneous Nodules Case is: A 40-year-old man of Scandinavian descent presented with enlarging, nonpainful upper extremity nodules developing over the preceding 9 months (Figure, A). He was renovating a commercial cannabis grow-house in California at time of onset. He described the construction site as being filled with intoxicating mold. He reported shortness of breath and a 20-pound weight loss. He denied recent travel or aquarium exposure. Most concerning was the inability to use his right upper extremity. Also, he developed a pathological fracture of his right foot (Figure, B). Clinical examination of his forearms revealed several yam-size (4-6 cm), nontender, nonulcerated, boggy subcutaneous nodules in a sporotrichoid pattern and large nodules scattered on his trunk and abdomen. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy or lower extremity lesions. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypothyroidism.

Title: An 11-Year-Old Boy With Vision Loss Case is: An 11-year-old boy of East-Asian descent presented to the hospital with an 8-month history of progressive vision loss, night blindness, and light sensitivity. He also had a long-standing complaint of dry eyes. His medical history included diagnoses of eczema and multiple food allergies. Owing to concerns about food triggers of his eczema, the child had a restrictive diet consisting solely of potato, pork, lamb, apples, cucumber, and Cheerios. There was no history of redness, discharge, or trauma to the eyes. The vision loss was not associated with pain, headache, fever, or photopsias (flashes of light). On examination, the child’s visual acuity was limited to detecting hand motion at 30 cm. His conjunctiva had dry, keratinized patches with foamy appearance (Figure 1A). The cornea showed areas of marked epitheliopathy with opacity (Figure 1B). His pupils were equal and reactive to light with no relative afferent pupillary defect. His funduscopic examination showed mild optic nerve pallor. He had normal extraocular movements.A, Photograph of the patient’s eye before treatment.

**Reasoning:**
The patient in the case is a woman in her 50s with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes. She presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain 1 day after discharge from an admission for similar abdominal pain. The patient described a 4-day history of progressively worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea and denied fevers, chills, diaphoresis, or any previous similar episodes. Her abdomen was distended and mildly tender, and her pain was disproportionate to the findings of her physical examination. There were no abnormal laboratory test findings. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan from her initial admission (Figure, A) and the abdominal CT angiogram on readmission (Figure, B) showed dramatic progression of her disease.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric ischemia is a condition in which the blood supply to the small intestine is compromised. This can lead to necrosis of the intestinal tissue and, if untreated, death.

The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes are all risk factors for mesenteric ischemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the blood vessels, including those in the abdomen. Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the abdomen. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin, which can also lead to decreased blood flow to the abdomen.

The patient's abdominal pain is consistent with mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric ischemia is a very painful condition. The pain is usually described as severe and disproportionate to the findings on physical examination. The pain is often described as "cramping" or "aching" and is often worse in the upper abdomen.

The patient's abdominal distention is also consistent with mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric ischemia can lead to a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, which can cause distention.

The patient's mild tenderness on abdominal examination is also consistent with mesenteric ischemia. Mesenteric ischemia can cause tenderness to palpation in the upper abdomen.

The lack of abnormal laboratory test findings is not helpful in making the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia. Laboratory test findings are often normal in patients with mesenteric ischemia.

The abdominal CT scan from her initial admission (Figure, A) and the abdominal CT angiogram on readmission (Figure, B) showed dramatic progression of her disease. The CT scan from her initial admission showed isolated duodenal thickening. The CT angiogram on readmission showed thickened small bowel and free fluid. These findings are consistent with mesenteric ischemia.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is mesenteric ischemia. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory test findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. The abdominal CT scan and CT angiogram confirm the diagnosis.

Title: Profound Vision Loss After a Traumatic Work Injury Case is: A 43-year-old construction worker experienced bilateral lower extremity crush injuries after a large heavy object fell onto his thighs, traumatically amputating his right leg. He also had a left leg degloving injury, distal femur fracture, and posterior knee dislocation with bleeding through the open fractures and wounds. He was profoundly hypotensive (blood pressure, 70/40 mm Hg) and anemic (hemoglobin level, 5.6 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) from extensive blood loss. He was urgently transfused and taken to the operating room for bilateral lower extremity irrigation and drainage and reconstruction of the left leg. Unfortunately, postoperative infection necessitated a left leg above-knee amputation.The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, intubated, and sedated for 1 month. On awakening, he reported that he was unable to see out of each eye. Bedside examination revealed no light perception vision with 7-mm pupils that were nonreactive bilaterally. Extraocular movements were full and there was no ptosis. Slitlamp examination findings were normal, and fundus photographs of the posterior pole in each eye are presented in the Figure. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed earlier in the hospitalization was normal. The patient was previously healthy and did not take any medications.Appearance of the optic nerves in fundus photographs taken 4 weeks after the patient’s injury at work.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has profound vision loss with bilateral nonreactive pupils. The fundus photographs show diffuse pallor of the optic discs, which is consistent with optic atrophy. This is a sign of damage to the optic nerves, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, infection, and inflammation. In this case, the most likely cause is the patient's traumatic work injury.

Answer: The correct answer is C. Counsel the patient on the prognosis of his condition. The patient's vision loss is likely permanent, and he should be counseled on how to adjust to his new life. He may need to learn how to use a cane or a guide dog, and he may need to make changes to his home and work environment to make them accessible. He may also need to see a therapist to help him cope with the emotional impact of his vision loss.

The other options are not appropriate. Option A, testing the patient with optokinetic nystagmus drum, is not necessary in this case because the patient's vision loss is clearly bilateral and nonreactive. Option B, repeating the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, is not likely to be helpful because the initial MRI was normal. Option D, testing the pupils with dilute pilocarpine, is a test for Horner's syndrome, which is not a likely diagnosis in this case.

Title: Blepharitis With Facial Numbness and Ocular Pain Case is: A man in his 60s presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of numbness of the right side of the forehead and cheek and severe right-sided ocular discomfort that was relentless and kept him awake at night. He had been seen 2 weeks previously with similar symptoms and was diagnosed as having blepharitis and discharged with instructions for eyelid hygiene. His symptoms failed to improve, and he visited his family physician the following week. His physician prescribed a course of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, but the symptoms remained.The patient had no other ocular history or history of facial surgery. His medical history included ischemic heart disease and hypercholesterolemia, and he was an ex-smoker of 20 pack-years.Examination revealed unaided visual acuity of 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. He had no evidence of proptosis, no relative afferent pupillary defect, and a full range of extraocular eye movement. Slitlamp examination demonstrated moderate bilateral blepharitis and extensive punctate keratopathy of the right eye. Findings from posterior segment examination were unremarkable. Examination of the cranial nerves demonstrated reduced sensation in the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the right trigeminal nerve, including complete corneal anesthesia. All other cranial nerve functions remained normal.Order computed tomography of the brain with angiographyPrescribe analgesia to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia and refer the patient to a neurologistOrder contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brainWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with atypical trigeminal neuralgia. This is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face. The characteristic symptoms of atypical trigeminal neuralgia are severe, stabbing or shooting pain in the face, often triggered by innocuous stimuli such as touching the face or brushing the teeth. The pain is typically unilateral and located in the distribution of the ophthalmic or maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve.

In the absence of other findings, such as proptosis, a relative afferent pupillary defect, or a full range of extraocular eye movement, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is atypical trigeminal neuralgia. To confirm the diagnosis, a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain should be ordered. This will help to rule out other possible causes of facial pain, such as a tumor or a stroke.

If the MRI is normal, the patient can be treated with a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Medications that are commonly used to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia include carbamazepine, gabapentin, and oxcarbazepine. These medications work by blocking the transmission of pain signals in the nervous system. Lifestyle changes that can help to reduce pain include avoiding triggers, such as touching the face or brushing the teeth, and using relaxation techniques, such as massage or meditation.

Title: Evaluation and Management of Unilateral Congenital Ptosis in a Healthy Child Case is: A 5-year-old girl was referred for evaluation of blepharoptosis of the left eye present since birth (Figure). Her mother reported that, since infancy, the child’s left eye has twitched during feeding and mealtimes. The patient was born at term; had an unremarkable delivery; and had no history of developmental delay, trauma, or systemic illness. Her ocular history was significant only for bilateral mixed astigmatism (−0.25 + 0.75 × 145 OD and −0.25 + 1.00 × 005 OS). There was no family history of strabismus, amblyopia, or congenital ptosis. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. Pupils were reactive to light bilaterally, and there was neither an afferent pupillary defect nor anisocoria. Extraocular motility was full. There was notable asymmetry in the following eyelid measurements: palpebral fissure height (10 mm OD; 5-6 mm OS) and margin reflex distance 1 (3.5 mm OD; 0.5-1.5 mm OS). In addition, elevation of the left upper eyelid was observed with lateral jaw thrust but not with anterior-posterior jaw movements or with mouth opening and closing. The levator function was 14 mm OU, and the margin crease distances were 5 mm OD and 6 mm OS. The remainder of the anterior and posterior segment slitlamp examination was unremarkable.External photographs of blepharoptosis of the left eye in the neutral jaw position (A) and the left upper eyelid elevated with rightward jaw thrust (B).Discuss carefully observing vs surgical repair of the ptosisWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: Progressive Restrictive Strabismus in an Adult Woman Case is: A woman in her 60s presented to the ophthalmology clinic with 10 months of blurred vision in her left eye. More recently, she noted that her left eye “drifts out at times.” She also reported drooping of the left upper eyelid and binocular, variable horizontal or vertical diplopia at distance. She also complained of itchy eyes but denied any pain or headaches. Her medical history includes breast cancer, diagnosed in 2000 and treated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy. A mammogram, completed 4 months before her ophthalmology visit, was reported as stable. On presentation, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. She had slightly decreased color vision (8/10 Ishihara plates) of the left eye and there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual fields were full. External examination revealed mild left proptosis and severely limited adduction of the left eye. Both optic nerves appeared normal on retinal examination. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Figure 1) showed a 2.3-cm intraconal mass inseparable from the left lateral rectus muscle. The mass medially deviated the left optic nerve and conformed to the shape of the orbital globe with mild bony remodeling of the lateral orbital wall.T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows a 2.3-cm intraconal mass (black asterisk) molding to the left orbital globe with medial deviation of the optic nerve (blue asterisk).What Would You Do Next?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of breast cancer who presents with progressive restrictive strabismus in her left eye. The physical examination findings are consistent with a mass in the left orbit, which is confirmed on MRI. The differential diagnosis for this includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors, as well as inflammatory conditions.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a recurrent breast cancer that has metastasized to the orbit. This is supported by the patient's history of breast cancer, the location of the mass in the left orbit, and the MRI findings.

The next step in management is to perform an excisional biopsy of the mass to confirm the diagnosis and determine the stage of the disease. This will also allow for the removal of as much of the tumor as possible, which may improve the patient's vision and reduce the risk of further spread of the cancer.

Title: A New Monoclonal Protein Detected in a Patient With Myeloma Undergoing Elotuzumab Therapy Case is: A 73-year-old man was diagnosed as having multiple myeloma (MM), with serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IF) showing a monoclonal (M) IgA κ at 0.3 g/dL and serum free κ/λ ratio skewed at 257. A computed tomographic scan showed lytic lesions, and bone marrow biopsy findings revealed 30% κ-restricted plasma cells. He was assigned to the bortezimib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone–elotuzumab (VRD-E) arm of a phase 3 trial. Three weeks after therapy initiation, follow-up SPEP-IF demonstrated an M-IgA κ at 0.1 g/dL. Two months later, SPEP-IF demonstrated a new M-IgG κ band in the same electrophoretic position as the M-IgA κ, with the 2 distinguishable only by IF and measured at 0.1 g/dL. Three months later, SPEP-IF demonstrated only the M-IgG κ, with the original M-IgA κ not detected. Over the next 8 months, the patient received maintenance therapy with VRD-E, and monthly SPEP-IF consistently showed M-IgG κ at 0.1 g/dL, with the original M-IgA κ consistently not detected. The serum free κ/λ ratio gradually decreased to 4.86 one year later.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of plasma cells. Plasma cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that help the body fight infection. In multiple myeloma, the plasma cells become cancerous and produce abnormal antibodies called monoclonal proteins. Monoclonal proteins can be detected in the blood and urine.

The patient was treated with a combination of drugs called bortezimib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. These drugs are known to cause immune dysregulation, which can lead to the production of new monoclonal proteins.

The patient's SPEP-IF showed a monoclonal IgA κ at 0.3 g/dL. Two months later, the SPEP-IF showed a new monoclonal IgG κ band in the same electrophoretic position as the M-IgA κ. Three months later, the SPEP-IF showed only the M-IgG κ, with the original M-IgA κ not detected.

The most likely explanation for these findings is that the patient's myeloma cells evolved to produce both IgG- and IgA-secreting cells. This is a known phenomenon in multiple myeloma, and it can occur as a result of treatment with certain drugs.

A. Clonal evolution of myeloma cells to both IgG- and IgA-secreting cells.

Title: A 52-Year-Old Man With Unheralded Syncope Case is: A 52-year-old man with mild asthma presented to the hospital after an episode of unheralded syncope while walking. On arrival, he was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 35/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and pulse oximetry of 98% on ambient air. His examination revealed regular bradycardia without cannon A waves, clear lung fields to auscultation, and warm extremities. Chest radiography revealed hilar adenopathy. Electrocardiography showed sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left posterior fascicle, and right bundle branch blocks (Figure 1A). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 50% without regional variation. On exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography, the patient completed 9 minutes of a standard Bruce protocol and developed transient high-grade atrioventricular block but had no ischemic ST-segment changes or defects on perfusion imaging. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with gadolinium contrast-enhanced first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and contrast-enhanced late gadolinium enhancement imaging revealed low-normal left ventricular systolic function but no other abnormalities (Figure 1B).What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient is a 52-year-old man with mild asthma who presented to the hospital after an episode of unheralded syncope while walking. On arrival, he was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate of 35/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and pulse oximetry of 98% on ambient air. His examination revealed regular bradycardia without cannon A waves, clear lung fields to auscultation, and warm extremities. Chest radiography revealed hilar adenopathy. Electrocardiography showed sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left posterior fascicle, and right bundle branch blocks. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 50% without regional variation. On exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography, the patient completed 9 minutes of a standard Bruce protocol and developed transient high-grade atrioventricular block but had no ischemic ST-segment changes or defects on perfusion imaging. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with gadolinium contrast-enhanced first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and contrast-enhanced late gadolinium enhancement imaging revealed low-normal left ventricular systolic function but no other abnormalities.

The most likely cause of the patient's syncope is a vasovagal reaction. This is a common cause of syncope, especially in young and middle-aged adults. It is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, which can lead to loss of consciousness. Vasovagal reactions can be triggered by a number of factors, including emotional stress, pain, or prolonged standing.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a vasovagal reaction. He is a young, healthy man with no history of cardiac disease. His syncope was unheralded and occurred while he was walking, which are typical features of a vasovagal reaction. His ECG showed sinus bradycardia and first-degree atrioventricular block, which are also common findings in patients with vasovagal syncope. His chest radiography and echocardiography were normal, and his cMRI showed no evidence of structural heart disease.

The next step in the evaluation of the patient's syncope is to perform a 30-day event monitor. This will allow the clinician to determine if the patient has any other episodes of syncope. If the patient does have additional episodes, the clinician can then perform further testing, such as invasive electrophysiologic testing or coronary angiography, to determine the underlying cause of the syncope.

In the absence of any further episodes of syncope, the patient can be managed conservatively with lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding prolonged standing and avoiding triggers that may precipitate vasovagal reactions.

A skin punch biopsy demonstrated subtle vacuolar change; rare epidermal dyskeratosis, including within a hair follicle; and superficial perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate with occasional eosinophils.

The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for a number of possible diagnoses, including:

* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): GVHD is a common complication of HSCT, and can involve the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and lungs. GVHD typically presents within the first few months after transplantation, but can occur at any time. The skin findings of GVHD can vary, but typically include a maculopapular rash that is often pruritic and confluent.
* Infection: Infection is a common complication of HSCT, and can occur from a variety of sources, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The skin findings of infection can vary depending on the underlying pathogen, but can include a maculopapular rash, pustules, or ulcers.
* Drug reaction: Drug reactions can occur to any medication, but are more common to certain medications, such as antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. The skin findings of drug reactions can vary, but typically include a maculopapular rash, which can be pruritic or painful.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are not specific for any one diagnosis. The skin biopsy results are suggestive of GVHD, but are not definitive. The next step in management is to perform bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions. This will help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's pulmonary infiltrates, and will guide further management.

Reasoning:
The patient's pain medication regimen includes methadone, immediate-release morphine, gabapentin, duloxetine, and celecoxib. The urine drug screen results show the presence of methadone, morphine, and codeine.

Methadone is a long-acting opioid analgesic that is used to treat chronic pain. It is also used to treat opioid addiction. Methadone is metabolized in the liver to morphine and other metabolites.

Morphine is a short-acting opioid analgesic that is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is also used to treat opioid addiction. Morphine is metabolized in the liver to codeine and other metabolites.

Codeine is a short-acting opioid analgesic that is used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is also used to treat cough. Codeine is metabolized in the liver to morphine and other metabolites.

The presence of methadone, morphine, and codeine in the patient's urine suggests that she is taking all three medications.

Title: Scrotal Ulceration and Pyrexia Case is: A previously healthy man in his 30s presented with spontaneous bruising, epistaxis, and haematuria. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) was diagnosed by bone marrow aspirate morphology, immunophenotyping, and detection of the bcr1 variant of the PML-RARα fusion transcript in peripheral blood. He was commenced on treatment with the PETHEMA LPA 20051 protocol consisting of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and idarubicin, an anthracycline based chemotherapy. Dexamethasone was prescribed to reduce the risk of ATRA syndrome, a potentially life threatening complication seen in these patients and characterized by fever, pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, and leucocytosis.After 12 days of treatment, the patient developed pyrexia and was started on empiric antibiotics. Two days later he developed tender black spots on the scrotum that progressed to painful ulcers over 8 days (Figure, A). Systemic antifungal and antiviral therapy were added with no improvement. Peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify bacterial or viral infection. Scrotal ultrasonography showed a subcutaneous hypervascular lesion with no abscess. The development and progression of scrotal ulceration coincided with recovery in neutrophil count from 0.3 × 109/L to 1.2 × 109/L and persistent pyrexia. As scrotal ulceration progressed, they enlarged and became necrotic with a black eschar.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case has a history of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and is currently receiving treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and idarubicin. He developed pyrexia and tender black spots on the scrotum that progressed to painful ulcers over 8 days. Systemic antifungal and antiviral therapy were added with no improvement. Peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify bacterial or viral infection. Scrotal ultrasonography showed a subcutaneous hypervascular lesion with no abscess. The development and progression of scrotal ulceration coincided with recovery in neutrophil count from 0.3 × 109/L to 1.2 × 109/L and persistent pyrexia. As scrotal ulceration progressed, they enlarged and became necrotic with a black eschar. A specimen was obtained for histopathology.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA. ATRA is a retinoic acid analog that is used in the treatment of APL. It works by inducing differentiation of promyelocytes into mature granulocytes. However, ATRA can also cause a number of side effects, including skin rash, gastrointestinal upset, and bone marrow suppression. In rare cases, ATRA can also cause scrotal ulceration.

The development of scrotal ulceration in this patient is consistent with the known side effects of ATRA. The ulceration coincided with recovery in neutrophil count, which suggests that it was caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to ATRA. The histopathologic specimen showed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with focal necrosis, which is also consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are Fournier gangrene, deep fungal infection, and mycobacterial infection. Fournier gangrene is a necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum that is caused by a polymicrobial infection. It is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent surgical intervention. Deep fungal infection is a rare but serious complication of chemotherapy. It can cause skin ulcers, pneumonia, and meningitis. Mycobacterial infection is also a rare but serious complication of chemotherapy. It can cause skin ulcers, lymphadenitis, and osteomyelitis.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA. The other possible diagnoses are less likely.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 30s with a 1-year history of unintentional weight loss, mild diffuse abdominal pain, and occasional episodes of vomiting. She presented to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of intense abdominal pain, fever, and loose stools. An abdominal computed tomographic scan showed findings consistent with bowel perforation, and she was admitted to the intensive care unit after emergent exploratory laparotomy. Her medical history was significant for 1 other episode of idiopathic bowel perforation 3 years prior. She denied taking any medications. Dermatology was consulted to evaluate an asymptomatic skin eruption that had been present for at least 8 months before her hospitalization. Physical examination revealed numerous 5- to 10-mm nontender papules with a porcelain-white atrophic center and an erythematous halo, alongside scattered atrophic white scars. The lesions were distributed across her trunk, neck, and upper and lower extremities. Palms, soles, scalp, genitalia, and mucosal surfaces were spared. Her neurological and mental state examination had unremarkable results. Biopsy specimens from her thigh and back were obtained.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with a history of bowel perforation and an asymptomatic skin eruption includes a number of conditions, including:

* Pancreatitis panniculitis: This is a rare inflammatory condition that can cause skin lesions similar to those described in the patient. However, pancreatitis panniculitis is typically associated with abdominal pain, fever, and elevation of pancreatic enzymes. The patient in this case did not have any of these findings.
* Malignant atrophic papulosis: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause skin lesions similar to those described in the patient. However, malignant atrophic papulosis is typically associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The patient in this case did not have any of these findings.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus: This is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, rashes, and ulcers. However, systemic lupus erythematosus is typically associated with other systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, and joint pain. The patient in this case did not have any of these findings.
* Lymphomatoid papulosis: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause skin lesions similar to those described in the patient. Lymphomatoid papulosis is typically characterized by recurrent crops of papules that resolve spontaneously. The patient in this case has had a single episode of skin lesions that have been present for at least 8 months.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is lymphomatoid papulosis.

Title: Erythema With Nonscarring, Tense Blister Formation Without Circulating Anti-BP180 Antibodies Case is: A woman in her 80s presented with a 1-year history of pruritic erythema on the trunk and extremities. The erythema did not respond to topical corticosteroid, oral roxithromycin (300 mg/d), or narrow-band UV-B phototherapy. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and was treated with glimepiride, sitagliptin phosphate hydrate, and amlodipine besylate. The patient also had polymyalgia, which was treated with a low dose of prednisolone. The prednisolone therapy had been discontinued 2 months before her visit to the dermatology clinic when she had been hospitalized with pneumonia. Multiple tense blisters had subsequently appeared on the palms. Physical examination at the first visit revealed scaly erythematous plaques on the whole body and tense blisters on the arms, hands, soles, and buttocks. Neither scar formation or mucosal involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a bulla on the forearm. Histopathologic analysis revealed a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils. The results of an IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 noncollagenous (NC) 16A were negative.

Reasoning: The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a 1-year history of pruritic erythema on the trunk and extremities. The erythema did not respond to topical corticosteroid, oral roxithromycin (300 mg/d), or narrow-band UV-B phototherapy. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and is treated with glimepiride, sitagliptin phosphate hydrate, and amlodipine besylate. The patient also had polymyalgia, which was treated with a low dose of prednisolone.

After treatment with oral prednisolone, 20 mg/d, the lesions healed without scar or milia formation.

The most likely diagnosis is bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of tense blisters at the junction of the epidermis and dermis. The blisters are usually preceded by a period of itching and erythema. Bullous pemphigoid is most common in adults over the age of 60. The cause of bullous pemphigoid is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. In autoimmune disorders, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In the case of bullous pemphigoid, the immune system attacks the proteins that hold the epidermis and dermis together. This leads to the formation of blisters.

The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A skin biopsy is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis. A skin biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. The biopsy can show the characteristic changes of bullous pemphigoid, such as the presence of a subepidermal blister.

There is no cure for bullous pemphigoid, but it can be treated with medication. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and prevent complications. Medications used to treat bullous pemphigoid include corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and plasmapheresis. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce the inflammation and itching associated with bullous pemphigoid. Immunosuppressants are drugs that suppress the immune system. They can be used to reduce the amount of antibodies that are attacking the skin. Plasmapheresis is a procedure in which the plasma, the liquid part of the blood, is removed and replaced with fresh plasma. This procedure can help to remove the antibodies that are attacking the skin.

The prognosis for bullous pemphigoid is generally good. Most patients with bullous pemphigoid respond well to treatment and the blisters will heal. However, the disease can be chronic and some patients may experience recurrences. In rare cases, bullous pemphigoid can be life-threatening. This is usually due to complications such as infection or sepsis.

Title: Infantile-Onset Fever and Urticaria Case is: A 5-year-old white girl presented with a history of recurrent fevers and urticaria since 2 months of age. The child had fevers (maximum temperature, 40°C) that lasted 3 to 5 days. Her mother reported that the fevers resolved spontaneously but continued to recur almost every month. The fever symptoms were associated with bilateral conjunctivitis, arthralgias, and irritability. The hivelike, nonpruritic urticaria did not improve with antihistamine medication and there were no known precipitating or aggravating factors. The child did not attend day care. Family history was noncontributory and her parents denied consanguinity.The child was hospitalized on multiple occasions during infancy for the fevers, and she had comprehensive sepsis evaluations, including lumbar punctures, with negative results. Findings from chest and abdominal imaging and bone marrow aspiration with biopsy were negative for a malignant process. Despite extensive evaluation, a definitive source for the fevers was not identified, and the patient was referred to our institution.On physical examination, the patient was febrile (temperature, 39°C) and appeared fussy. Growth measure findings were normal. Skin examination confirmed nonpruritic, macular and urticarial lesions on the face, back, and lower extremities (Figure).

Findings from chest and abdominal imaging and bone marrow aspiration with biopsy were negative for a malignant process. Despite extensive evaluation, a definitive source for the fevers was not identified, and the patient was referred to our institution.

On physical examination, the patient was febrile (temperature, 39°C) and appeared fussy. Growth measure findings were normal.

Findings from the remainder of physical examination were normal.

The differential diagnosis for a child with recurrent fevers and urticaria includes a variety of infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic disorders. In this case, the patient's history of recurrent fevers that resolve spontaneously, associated with conjunctivitis, arthralgias, and irritability, is consistent with a diagnosis of Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS). FCAS is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, urticaria, arthralgias, and conjunctivitis in response to cold exposure. The diagnosis of FCAS is made based on clinical findings, and can be confirmed by genetic testing.

The treatment of FCAS is aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of flares. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and anakinra. In severe cases, immunoglobulin replacement therapy may be necessary.

Title: Arm Swelling Following Attempted Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Case is: An elderly woman was transferred from an extended care facility with lower abdominal pain. She was afebrile with a heart rate of 120 beats/min on admission and leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 23 000/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]). Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a large intrauterine abscess. An attempt to insert a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) into the right basilic vein was unsuccessful. An intravenous catheter in the left hand was established for the administration of antibiotics. The following day, the patient developed right upper extremity pain and swelling. Physical examination revealed tense and tender swelling of the right upper extremity that was more marked in the upper arm and caused significant impairment in motor function, but sensation to touch and pin prick was intact (Figure 1A). The right radial pulse was absent, but biphasic Doppler arterial signals were present in the right radial and ulnar artery. Duplex ultrasonographic imaging of the right upper extremity demonstrated a 12.8 × 2.6-cm heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow (Figure 1B).Patient presentation (A) and ultrasonographic imaging (B) of the upper arm.Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremityCompartment syndrome resulting from infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues of the upper extremityWhat Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient presented with right upper extremity pain and swelling following an unsuccessful attempt to insert a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) into the right basilic vein. The physical examination revealed tense and tender swelling of the right upper extremity that was more marked in the upper arm and caused significant impairment in motor function, but sensation to touch and pin prick was intact. The right radial pulse was absent, but biphasic Doppler arterial signals were present in the right radial and ulnar artery. Duplex ultrasonographic imaging of the right upper extremity demonstrated a 12.8 × 2.6-cm heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow.

These findings are most consistent with compartment syndrome resulting from infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues of the upper extremity. Compartment syndrome is a medical emergency that occurs when the pressure within a closed fascial compartment increases to a level that compromises the circulation and function of the tissues within the compartment. The most common cause of compartment syndrome is trauma, but it can also occur as a complication of surgery, burns, or other medical conditions.

In the setting of compartment syndrome, the patient typically presents with pain, swelling, and tenderness of the affected extremity. The pain is often described as severe and out of proportion to the injury. The swelling is typically tense and non-pitting. The patient may also have sensory changes, such as numbness and tingling, and motor weakness in the affected extremity.

The diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made based on clinical findings. Laboratory tests, such as an arterial blood gas or a lactate level, may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis, but they are not definitive. The definitive diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as an MRI or a CT scan.

The treatment of compartment syndrome is surgical. The goal of surgery is to decompress the compartment by making an incision in the fascia. This allows the pressure to decrease and the circulation to improve. The patient is typically placed in a splint or cast to immobilize the extremity.

The prognosis for compartment syndrome is generally good if it is diagnosed and treated promptly. However, if it is not treated, the patient may develop permanent damage to the nerves and muscles in the affected extremity.

Title: Acute-Onset Blurred Vision With Shallow Anterior Chamber and Suspected Choroidal Mass Case is: A healthy 67-year-old man presented to the ocular oncology service with a 3-day history of acute-onset blurred vision and mild tenderness of his left eye. He denied notable ocular history aside from a recently documented elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36 mm Hg OS and shallow anterior chamber (AC). Laser peripheral iridotomy had been performed but failed to deepen the AC. Subsequently, a choroidal mass was discovered, and he was referred for our opinion.On examination, refractive error was +3.00 D OU, and best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/40 OS. Results of examination in the right eye were unremarkable, and IOP was 17 mm Hg. Examination of the left eye revealed elevated IOP of 26 mm Hg while the patient was taking dorzolamide/timolol. The AC was shallow, and episcleral vessels were congested. Ophthalmoscopic examination and wide-angle scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Figure 1A) documented a ring-shaped peripheral ciliochoroidal mass accompanied by shallow serous retinal detachment inferiorly. Globe transillumination revealed an undefined mottled choroidal shadow inferiorly. B-scan ultrasonography (Figure 1B) and ultrasound biomicroscopy suggested an echolucent ciliochoroidal elevation without intrinsic vascular pulsations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits confirmed the ring-shaped ciliochoroidal elevation with nonenhancement of the mass. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal flow parameters without evidence of a dural-cavernous fistula.A, Wide-angle fundus photograph demonstrating peripheral choroidal elevation, most prominent superotemporally, and numerous choroidal folds.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a choroidal mass that is causing shallow anterior chamber and elevated intraocular pressure. The mass is non-enhancing on MRI, suggesting that it is not a metastasis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not a good option because it can damage the eye and cause further vision loss. Plaque radiotherapy is a good option for treating choroidal melanoma, but it is not effective for non-malignant choroidal masses. Oral corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and improve vision, but they are not curative. Sclerotomies, or creation of scleral windows, is the best option for draining the subretinal fluid and relieving the pressure on the optic nerve. This will improve the patient's vision and prevent further vision loss.

Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral mydriasis, with a reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation (Figure). Diluted norepinephrine (0.1%) was instilled in both eyes, which elicited supersensitive dilatation of the pupils bilaterally owing to reinnervation and upregulation of the postsynaptic receptors, consistent with tonic pupils. Uncorrected Snellen visual acuity was 20/32 OU for distance and 20/200 OU for near. Ocular motility was normal. Results of slitlamp examination and ophthalmoscopy showed no abnormalities.Bilateral mydriasis with a reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation in an 11-year-old boy.Results of complete blood cell counts, serum chemistry examination, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and virologic studies of blood and stool performed for exclusion of infection were all negative.

Title: A Peaked Pupil Case is: A 51-year-old woman presented to our institution’s emergency department with an ocular surface lesion in the left eye. She had an 11-mm pigmented conjunctival lesion that was suspicious for melanoma with significant involvement of the caruncle, bulbar conjunctiva, and palpebral conjunctiva. The patient subsequently underwent a complete excision of the tumor and supplemental cryotherapy to the resection bed. Pathological results confirmed the diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma. The tumor had invaded the medial canthus and medial rectus insertion; however, no scleral invasion was observed during the intraoperative examination. Three months later, she had a new pigment deposition adjacent to the limbus in the area of the prior resection, for which she underwent additional excision and cryotherapy. Pathology specimens from this excision were negative for atypia. The patient was given mitomycin C as adjuvant therapy.Two months later, the patient presented for follow-up. Her visual acuity and intraocular pressure were at baseline and within normal limits, respectively. On slitlamp examination, a peaked pupil was noted (Figure 1). No new pigment was noted on the ocular surface. She also stated that she had pain to the eye.A, Slitlamp photography of the left eye demonstrating the pupil peaked toward the 9:30 area.

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of conjunctival melanoma. She has undergone multiple excisions and cryotherapy, and is currently receiving mitomycin C as adjuvant therapy. She presents with a new complaint of pain and a peaked pupil.

The most likely cause of the peaked pupil is a peripheral anterior synechia (PAS). PAS is a condition in which the iris becomes adherent to the trabecular meshwork, which can lead to increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma. PAS can be caused by a number of factors, including inflammation, trauma, and surgery.

In this case, the patient has a history of conjunctival melanoma, which is a risk factor for PAS. Additionally, she is currently receiving mitomycin C, which can also increase the risk of PAS.

The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM) to confirm the presence of PAS and to assess the extent of the disease. UBM is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed information about the anterior segment of the eye.

If PAS is confirmed, the next step will be to treat the underlying cause. In this case, the mitomycin C may need to be discontinued. Additionally, the patient may need to undergo a laser iridotomy to create a new opening in the iris. This will allow the aqueous humor to flow from the anterior chamber to the posterior chamber, which will help to lower the intraocular pressure.

The patient should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of glaucoma, such as increased intraocular pressure, blurred vision, and pain. If glaucoma develops, it will need to be treated with medications or surgery.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient has bilateral peripheral visual field loss that has been stable for 5 years. The examination findings are consistent with congenitally anomalous optic nerves. There is no evidence of glaucoma or other optic nerve disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is congenitally anomalous optic nerves. The patient should be reassured that the visual field loss is not progressive and that they do not need any treatment at this time. However, they should be seen annually for follow-up to monitor the visual field.

**Answer:**
C. Reassure the patient that VF loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves and recommend annual evaluation to monitor VF.

Title: Chest Pain and Shortness of Breath After a Heart Transplant Case is: A 34-year-old man with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy requiring a heart transplant 11 months earlier presented to the hospital with subacute onset of shortness of breath. His posttransplant course was notable for moderate cellular rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 2R) within the first 6 weeks, which was treated with a pulse of corticosteroids. Subsequently, he had normal allograft function with no further rejection noted on routine surveillance biopsies. Three days prior to this presentation, he experienced an episode of mild chest pain associated with radiation down his left arm and vomiting. He did not seek medical attention at that time as he felt the pain was unlikely to be coming from his heart. Over the preceding days, he developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, which prompted him to present to the emergency department. His electrocardiogram (ECG) on presentation is shown in Figure, A. His bedside echocardiogram showed anteroseptal akinesis with apical thrombus and reduced left ventricular function (Figure, B and Video).A, Patient’s admission electrocardiogram demonstrated new ST elevations of 1 to 2 mm in the anterolateral leads with Q waves in I, aVL, and across the precordial leads. B, His bedside echocardiogram demonstrated anteroseptal akinesis with apical thrombus (arrowhead) and reduced left ventricular function.Order an emergent coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy.What Would You Do Next? A: Order an emergent coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy. , B: Check cytomegalovirus viral load. , C: Administer empirical pulse-dose corticosteroids. , D: Perform an endomyocardial biopsy alone.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient's presentation is concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is a leading cause of death in patients after heart transplantation. The ECG shows new ST elevations in the anterolateral leads with Q waves in I, aVL, and across the precordial leads, which are consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The echocardiogram shows anteroseptal akinesis with apical thrombus and reduced left ventricular function, which are also consistent with ACS.

The next step in management is to perform an emergent coronary angiogram to determine the cause of the ACS. The angiogram will show if there are any blockages in the coronary arteries that can be treated with angioplasty and stenting. If there are no blockages, the angiogram will help to rule out other causes of the ACS, such as myocarditis or cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV).

An endomyocardial biopsy is also indicated in this patient to evaluate for rejection. Rejection is a common complication after heart transplantation and can cause a variety of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and decreased heart function. An endomyocardial biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is taken from the heart muscle to be examined under a microscope. The biopsy can help to determine if the patient is rejecting their heart transplant and can guide treatment decisions.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that can affect the heart after heart transplantation. CMV infection can cause a variety of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and decreased heart function. CMV infection is treated with antiviral medications.

Empirical pulse-dose corticosteroids are not indicated in this patient. Empirical pulse-dose corticosteroids are a treatment for acute rejection, but there is no evidence that they are effective in treating ACS. In fact, corticosteroids can worsen the symptoms of ACS by increasing the risk of bleeding.

**Answer:**
A. Order an emergent coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy.

Title: An Erysipeloid Cutaneous Eruption in a Woman With Advanced Breast Cancer Case is: A woman in her 60s presented with a 3-month history of a progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on her chest and back. She had a complex history of breast cancer on the left side that was first diagnosed in 1991 and was treated with lumpectomy, radiotherapy, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. In 2001, she experienced local disease recurrence and underwent complete mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on the left side and received adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen citrate and anastrozole. In 2014, she developed axillary lymphadenopathy on the right side and was found to have metastatic disease. She subsequently underwent axillary lymph node dissection on the right side, followed by treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide. Her most recent mammogram and positron-emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) showed no evidence of active disease. At the time of her evaluation, the patient’s physical examination was remarkable for discrete erysipeloid plaques on her chest, back, and right shoulder (Figure 1A). The lesions were warm and indurated but nontender to palpation. Serum chemistry profile, complete blood cell counts, and hepatic and renal function testing had normal results. Lesional skin biopsies were performed (Figure 1B).A, Clinical examination shows discrete erysipeloid plaques on the anterior chest.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 60s with a complex history of breast cancer. She has had multiple local recurrences and metastatic disease. She is currently receiving treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide. She presents with a 3-month history of a progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on her chest and back. The lesions are warm and indurated but nontender to palpation. Serum chemistry profile, complete blood cell counts, and hepatic and renal function testing have normal results. Lesional skin biopsies were performed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes carcinoma erysipeloides (cutaneous metastases of breast cancer), erysipelas, radiation dermatitis, and radiation-induced morphea.

Carcinoma erysipeloides is a rare cutaneous manifestation of breast cancer that is characterized by a rapidly spreading, erythematous plaque with central clearing. The lesions are often tender and may be associated with fever and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows metastatic breast cancer in the skin.

Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection caused by group A streptococcus. It is characterized by a well-demarcated, erythematous plaque with edema and tenderness. The lesions are often associated with fever and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by culture of the skin lesion.

Radiation dermatitis is a skin reaction that can occur after radiation therapy. It is characterized by erythema, edema, and desquamation. The lesions are often painful and may be associated with pruritus. The diagnosis is made clinically.

Radiation-induced morphea is a rare, chronic skin condition that can occur after radiation therapy. It is characterized by indurated, thickened skin with loss of elasticity. The lesions are often asymptomatic but may be painful. The diagnosis is made clinically.

In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is carcinoma erysipeloides. This is supported by the patient's history of breast cancer, the presence of a rapidly spreading, erythematous plaque with central clearing, and the absence of other causes of skin inflammation. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy, which shows metastatic breast cancer in the skin.

Title: Urinalysis in the Evaluation of Proliferative Glomerulonephritis Case is: A 62-year-old woman with a 10-year history of hypertension presented with elevated serum creatinine (2.26 mg/dL; reference range, 0.6-1.2 mg/dL). She had not visited a physician for several years but reported feeling well with no active symptoms. She had no risk factors for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV and reported no use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or herbal medications. One year ago, her urine was tea-colored during an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination results were normal except for elevated blood pressure (154/90 mm Hg). Although her hemoglobin concentration was low (10.5 g/dL; reference range, 11.6-15.2 g/dL), white blood cell count, platelet count, and electrolytes were normal. Her kidneys appeared structurally normal on ultrasound. Urine studies were performed (Table).Urinary tract infection is the most likely diagnosis.How Do You Interpret These Test Results? A: Urinary tract infection is the most likely diagnosis. , B: Proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis. , C: Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis. , D: Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is the most likely diagnosis.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history of hypertension and elevated serum creatinine suggest that she has kidney disease. The presence of red blood cells and protein in her urine is consistent with glomerulonephritis, which is inflammation of the glomeruli, the small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from the blood. The most common type of glomerulonephritis is proliferative glomerulonephritis, which is characterized by the proliferation of cells in the glomeruli. The patient's urine studies show evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis, including red blood cells, protein, and casts.

Title: Asymptomatic Pigmented Lesions of the Gingiva Case is: A white woman in her 50s presented to an oral medicine clinic for evaluation of asymptomatic pigmented lesions affecting the maxillary and mandibular gingiva of 6 years’ duration. The patient reported previous orolabial melanotic macules. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, and breast cancer. Medications included levalbuterol, nadolol, and cetirizine. Family medical history was significant for breast cancer and social history was unremarkable. Review of systems was positive for cutaneous ephelides. Physical examination revealed a 7 mm × 6 mm asymmetric, heterogeneously pigmented lesion without indurated borders on the gingiva associated with the left maxillary central incisor tooth (number 9) (Figure, A). A lesion similar in clinical appearance, although smaller, was observed on the gingiva associated with the right mandibular first premolar tooth (number 28) (Figure, B). Biopsy specimens were obtained with a 3 mm punch instrument from both lesions for routine histology which demonstrated similar microscopic findings (Figure, C and D).A, Heterogeneously pigmented lesion of the gingiva associated with the left maxillary central incisor. B, Heterogeneously pigmented lesion of the gingiva associated with the right mandibular first premolar.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a white woman in her 50s with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, and breast cancer. She presents with asymptomatic pigmented lesions affecting the maxillary and mandibular gingiva of 6 years’ duration. The lesions are asymmetric, heterogeneously pigmented, and without indurated borders. Biopsy specimens show a diffuse proliferation of heavily pigmented dendritic melanocytes that extend the full thickness of the epithelium. Melanin incontinence is also noted.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of oral melanotic macule. Oral melanotic macules are common, benign lesions that typically present as asymptomatic, flat, brown or black macules on the oral mucosa. They are more common in women and in people with darker skin pigmentation. The exact cause of oral melanotic macules is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by an increased number of melanocytes in the epithelium.

Oral melanotic macules are usually not associated with any significant risk of malignant transformation. However, they should be monitored closely for any changes in size, shape, or color. If any changes are noted, a biopsy should be performed to rule out a more serious condition, such as oral malignant melanoma.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a female infant with relapsed refractory infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia, blast crisis (>60% blasts), and central nervous system involvement who was admitted for reinduction chemotherapy with cytarabine, vincristine, daunorubicin, methotrexate, and dexamethasone. Seventeen days after her last day of chemotherapy, while neutropenic, she became febrile and developed several vesicles with an erythematous base on the lower back (Figure, A) and left thigh. Tissue and blood cultures and a punch biopsy specimen of a vesicle on the lower back were obtained. Hematoxylin-eosin (Figures, B and C), gram (Figure, D), and periodic acid-Schiff stains were performed on the punch biopsy. Testing for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus were also ordered.

The most likely diagnosis is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including vesicles. The lesions are typically located on the face, mouth, or genitals, but can also occur on other parts of the body. HSV infection is most common in children and young adults, but can occur at any age.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with HSV infection. She is a young child with a history of leukemia, which puts her at increased risk for infection. She developed a fever and vesicles with an erythematous base on the lower back, which are typical of HSV infection. The vesicles are also located in a typical location for HSV infection, which is on the lower back.

The laboratory findings are also consistent with HSV infection. The hematoxylin-eosin stain shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes. The gram stain shows no bacteria. The periodic acid-Schiff stain shows no fungal hyphae. These findings are all consistent with HSV infection.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, listeriosis, and cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. VZV is a viral infection that can cause a varicella rash, which is a vesicular rash that typically occurs on the trunk and extremities. VZV infection is most common in children, but can occur at any age. Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, and meningitis. Listeriosis is most common in pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised patients. Cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection is a bacterial infection that can cause a skin rash, which is typically a pustular rash that occurs on the face and extremities. Cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection is most common in children and young adults.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is HSV infection. The patient's history, presentation, and laboratory findings are all consistent with HSV infection. VZV infection, listeriosis, and cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection are less likely diagnoses.

Title: Multiple Intracranial Parenchymal Lesions Evolving Over a Decade Case is: A teenage Chinese girl with intermittent limp and increasing headache was admitted to the hospital. She began to limp intermittently ten years earlier. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple parenchymal lesions involving the pons, bilateral amygdala, and the left temporal pole (Figure 1A). She refused further investigations until a year earlier, when she developed mild headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed minor focal enlargement of the lesions in the left temporal pole. One month before hospital admission, her headache aggravated and became intolerable. Enhanced MRI showed remarkable progression of the lesions in the left temporal lobe, involving the temporal pole and the parasylvian region, along with a newly developed mass in the third ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus. The lesions in the pons and the right amygdala remained stable (Figure 1B). Spinal cord MRI was normal. There was no history of tumors elsewhere. Family history was unremarkable. Her consciousness was intact, but her memory and concentration were poor. Pupil reflection was normal. There were multiple congenital nevi distributed over the body, 2 of which on the legs were more than 5 cm in diameter, and another 3 on her back and face were more than 3 cm. There were no focal motor or sensory deficits. Muscle stretch reflexes were normal. The rest of the neurologic and systemic examination was unremarkable. Gene examinations showed a mutation in the N-ras-2 gene.A and B, T1-weighted axial brain magnetic resonance imaging at the levels of pons, midbrain, and thalamus, performed ten years earlier, shows multiple parenchymal lesions including the pons, bilateral amygdala, and the left temporal pole (arrowheads).

The most likely diagnosis is neurocutaneous melanosis (NCCM). NCCM is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of multiple congenital melanocytic nevi (CMNs) and a predisposition to develop malignant melanoma. The lesions in the brain are most likely due to metastatic melanoma. The patient's history of intermittent limp and increasing headache is consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain, and the MRI findings are consistent with NCCM. The presence of multiple CMNs is a characteristic feature of NCCM, and the gene mutation in the N-ras-2 gene is diagnostic.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh was completed, and a skin biopsy was performed for culture and histology.

The most likely diagnosis is necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that can lead to death if not treated promptly. It is most commonly caused by group A streptococcus, but can also be caused by other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. The infection begins as a localized area of redness and swelling, which may progress to form a bulla or blister. The skin may become black and necrotic, and the patient may develop fever, chills, and other systemic symptoms.

The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is made based on clinical findings, including the history and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests and imaging studies. Treatment includes antibiotics, surgery to remove the necrotic tissue, and supportive care.

Title: Acute Right Lower Quadrant Abdominal Pain Case is: A previously healthy 4-year-old girl with a history of prematurity (31 weeks’ gestational age) presented as a transfer from an outside facility with abdominal pain. She had presented to an outside emergency department 2 days prior with lower abdominal pain that subsequently localized to the right lower quadrant. Her pain was accompanied by anorexia and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. She denied fevers or chills. She was noted to have voluntary guarding and focal right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a mild leukocytosis (white blood cell count = 14 × 103/μL [to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]) and normal urinalysis results. Abdominal ultrasonography images were obtained that failed to show her appendix and demonstrated no secondary signs of inflammation. Because of her notable tenderness, she was admitted for observation at the referring facility. No antibiotics were initiated, and her activity improved with intravenous hydration. However, her right lower abdominal pain persisted, prompting further evaluation. Computed tomography images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained, and the representative images are shown in Figure 1. She was transferred to our facility for surgical evaluation. In our emergency department, pelvic ultrasonography images were obtained that failed to show both the appendix and right adnexal structures.Computed tomographic images.

She is admitted for observation at the referring facility, where her activity improves with intravenous hydration, but her right lower abdominal pain persists. Computed tomography images of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate an inflamed retrocecal mass. She is transferred to our facility for surgical evaluation. Pelvic ultrasonography images obtained in our emergency department fail to show both the appendix and right adnexal structures.

The most likely diagnosis is perforated appendicitis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with appendicitis, and the CT scan findings show an inflamed retrocecal mass, which is a classic finding in perforated appendicitis. The patient's laboratory results are also consistent with appendicitis, as she has a mild leukocytosis.

Meckel diverticulitis is another possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than perforated appendicitis in this patient. Meckel diverticulitis is a condition in which a small, outpouching of the intestine becomes inflamed. It is most common in children and young adults. The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for Meckel diverticulitis, and the CT scan findings do not show a Meckel diverticulum.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. It can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but it is most commonly found in the ileum and colon. The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for Crohn disease, and the CT scan findings do not show any evidence of Crohn disease.

Ectopic ovarian torsion is a condition in which an ovary twists on its own blood supply. It is most common in women of reproductive age. The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for ectopic ovarian torsion, and the CT scan findings do not show any evidence of ectopic ovarian torsion.

Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient is a 4-year-old girl with a history of prematurity who presented with abdominal pain that subsequently localized to the right lower quadrant. She had anorexia, nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, and voluntary guarding and focal right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a mild leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasonography images failed to show her appendix and demonstrated no secondary signs of inflammation. Because of her notable tenderness, she was admitted for observation at the referring facility. No antibiotics were initiated, and her activity improved with intravenous hydration. However, her right lower abdominal pain persisted, prompting further evaluation. Computed tomography images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained, and the representative images are shown in Figure 1. She was transferred to our facility for surgical evaluation. In our emergency department, pelvic ultrasonography images were obtained that failed to show both the appendix and right adnexal structures.

The most likely diagnosis is perforated appendicitis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with appendicitis, and the abdominal ultrasonography findings are non-specific. The computed tomography findings are highly suggestive of perforated appendicitis, with a retrocecal mass and evidence of inflammation.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with severe substernal pain radiating to the left shoulder and back and subsequent swelling of the left side of her neck. She had been recently treated at an outpatient facility for a viral illness with multiple episodes of forceful coughing. There was no recent history of trauma to the neck or chest.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs and soft tissue swelling over the left supraclavicular area. No overlying skin changes or crepitus were appreciated. Laboratory data revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 18 000/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). A computed tomographic scan demonstrated extensive edema of the left neck, with fat stranding seen in the subcutaneous tissues extending into the left jugular, carotid, and esophageal spaces. Mediastinal edema and bilateral pleural effusions were also seen on computed tomographic scan. Owing to the concern for esophageal perforation, a barium swallow was performed, showing no extravasation of contrast.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes acute jugular thrombosis, spontaneous chylothorax, contained esophageal perforation, and descending necrotizing mediastinitis.

Acute jugular thrombosis is a rare condition that can occur secondary to infection, trauma, or coagulopathy. The patient in this case has no history of infection, trauma, or coagulopathy, making acute jugular thrombosis less likely.

Spontaneous chylothorax is a rare condition that occurs when there is a leak of chyle (a milky fluid that contains lymph and fat) from the thoracic duct into the pleural space. The patient in this case has no history of trauma or surgery to the chest, making spontaneous chylothorax less likely.

Contained esophageal perforation is a rare condition that occurs when there is a tear in the esophagus that is not associated with a free perforation into the chest or abdomen. The patient in this case has a history of viral illness with multiple episodes of forceful coughing, which could have led to an esophageal tear. However, the barium swallow did not show any extravasation of contrast, making contained esophageal perforation less likely.

Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs when infection spreads from the neck to the mediastinum (the middle compartment of the chest). The patient in this case has extensive soft tissue swelling over the left supraclavicular area, with fat stranding seen in the subcutaneous tissues extending into the left jugular, carotid, and esophageal spaces. Mediastinal edema and bilateral pleural effusions were also seen on computed tomographic scan. These findings are consistent with descending necrotizing mediastinitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is descending necrotizing mediastinitis.

Title: A Teenage Girl With Aseptic Meningitis and Unilateral Blurry Vision Case is: A 14-year-old girl presented to the emergency department after experiencing 2 weeks of fever, malaise, photophobia, phonophobia, headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness. Computed tomography scan results of her head did not reveal any acute intracranial pathology. Her systemic inflammatory markers were elevated, including a left-shifted leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15 200 μL (normal values, 4100-8900 μL) (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 0.001), a platelet count of 458 × 103 μL (150-450 × 103 μL) (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 1.0), and a C-reactive protein level of 17.3 mg/L (<8.0 mg/L) (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). Cerebrospinal fluid studies were suggestive of aseptic meningitis: elevated protein levels (0.139 g/dL, 0-0.035 g/dL) (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), increased neutrophils (32%, 2% ± 4%), normal opening pressure, and normal glucose levels.On day 2 of her hospitalization, she complained of left-eye blurred vision. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/70 OS. Both eyes had normal pupillary responses, color vision, and intraocular pressures. The results of an anterior chamber examination were unremarkable in each eye. The results of a dilated fundus examination of both eyes revealed significant inflammation, including 1+ vitreous cell levels, marked disc edema, intraretinal hemorrhages, and extensive sheathing of the retinal venules (Figure).Bilateral fundus photographs of the right eye (A) and left eye (B) on presentation.What Would You Do Next? A: Initiate systemic corticosteroids , B: Treat with an intraocular corticosteroid injection , C: Evaluate for systemic infectious disease , D: Begin administering intravenous acyclovir. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient presented with aseptic meningitis and unilateral blurred vision. The fundus examination revealed significant inflammation, including 1+ vitreous cell levels, marked disc edema, intraretinal hemorrhages, and extensive sheathing of the retinal venules. These findings are consistent with posterior uveitis, which is a common complication of aseptic meningitis. Systemic corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for posterior uveitis, and they are often effective in reducing inflammation and improving visual acuity. Intraocular corticosteroid injections may also be used to treat posterior uveitis, but they are typically reserved for patients who do not respond to systemic corticosteroids. Evaluation for systemic infectious disease is important in patients with aseptic meningitis, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's visual symptoms. Intravenous acyclovir is not indicated for the treatment of posterior uveitis.

Title: Fluid Leak Following Deep Midfacial Laceration Case is: A 55-year-old man presented to the emergency department following an unwitnessed assault, sustaining multiple facial contusions and lacerations. He was initially agitated and admitted to the intensive care unit with hemodynamic instability. The oral-maxillofacial surgery service was consulted for assessment of the facial lacerations, and the oculoplastic service was consulted for possible damage to the nasolacrimal system. The patient’s medical history at this point was unknown.From an ophthalmic standpoint, a single, deep laceration extended inferomedially from the right upper zygoma across the nasal dorsum and involving the eyelid-cheek junction (Figure 1). A significant amount of clear fluid was noted to be continually draining from the wound site.What Would You Do Next? A: Perform nasolacrimal duct irrigation , B: Explore, irrigate, and close the wound , C: Order computed tomography of the head/facial bones , D: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The first step in the management of a patient with a fluid leak following a deep midfacial laceration is to assess the patient's vital signs and general condition. In this case, the patient was initially agitated and admitted to the intensive care unit with hemodynamic instability. This suggests that the patient may have other injuries that require immediate attention. Once the patient's general condition has been stabilized, the next step is to evaluate the facial lacerations. In this case, the laceration is described as being single, deep, and extending inferomedially from the right upper zygoma across the nasal dorsum and involving the eyelid-cheek junction. This suggests that the laceration may have involved the nasolacrimal duct. The nasolacrimal duct is a small, tube-like structure that carries tears from the eye to the nose. If the nasolacrimal duct is injured, it can lead to a fluid leak from the eye. The next step is to determine the cause of the fluid leak. In this case, the fluid is described as being clear. This suggests that the fluid is not cerebrospinal fluid, which is typically yellow or bloody. The most likely cause of the fluid leak is that the nasolacrimal duct has been injured. The next step is to manage the fluid leak. In this case, the fluid leak can be managed by exploring, irrigating, and closing the wound. This will allow the nasolacrimal duct to heal and prevent further fluid leakage.

Title: Retinal Whitening After Uncomplicated Cataract Surgery Case is: A woman in her 60s presented 1 week after undergoing cataract surgery in the right eye complaining of persistent blurry vision. Her ocular history was notable for a previous uncomplicated cataract surgery in the left eye that had a good visual outcome. On postoperative day 1, her visual acuity was 20/60 OD, attributed to mild corneal edema, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg. A dilated fundus examination was not performed. At postoperative week 1, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 OD, her intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. The cornea was clear and there were trace anterior chamber cells. A dilated examination revealed multiple spots of retinal whitening with tiny intraretinal hemorrhages concentrated in the posterior pole (Figure, A). The patient was referred urgently for consultation by a retina specialist. Optical coherence tomography revealed intraretinal cystoid abnormalities in the macula and hyperreflective patches in the nerve fiber layer and inner nuclear layer (Figure, B).A, Fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrating multifocal patches of inner retinal whitening in the posterior pole.

The patient was referred urgently for consultation by a retina specialist. Optical coherence tomography revealed intraretinal cystoid abnormalities in the macula and hyperreflective patches in the nerve fiber layer and inner nuclear layer.

The most likely diagnosis is posterior segment inflammatory syndrome (PSIS), which is a rare but serious complication of cataract surgery. PSIS is characterized by inflammation of the retina and vitreous humor, and can lead to significant vision loss. The exact cause of PSIS is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction to surgical trauma.

The treatment of PSIS is typically with systemic steroids and/or intraocular steroids. In some cases, vitrectomy may be necessary to remove inflammatory cells and debris from the vitreous cavity. The prognosis for PSIS varies depending on the severity of the inflammation. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients will recover with good vision. However, some patients may experience permanent vision loss.

In this case, the patient should be started on systemic steroids and referred to a retina specialist for further evaluation and treatment. The patient should also be advised to avoid strenuous activity and to wear eye protection to prevent further injury to the eye.

The correct answer is: A. Start systemic steroids.

Title: An Elderly Man With a Pacemaker and a Recent Fall Case is: A man in his 80s presented to the emergency department after falling in his bathroom. There was no associated loss of consciousness, chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. For the past several weeks he had noted generalized weakness and fatigue. His medical history was pertinent for a dual-chamber pacemaker implant 3 years earlier for intermittent symptomatic second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Additional comorbidities included hypertension and well-controlled type 1 diabetes with no recent changes in his medications. Initial vital signs showed a systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg and results of physical examination demonstrated clear lungs. Results of cardiovascular examination demonstrated no gallops, murmurs, or rubs. Results of electrocardiography performed on admission are shown in Figure 1. His pacemaker was programmed to a DDDR (dual-chamber, rate-adaptive) pacing mode with an AV delay of 300 milliseconds and tracking rates from 60 to 110 pulses per minute. The postventricular atrial refractory period was programmed to 200 milliseconds.Increase the atrial pacing rate to 70 beats per minuteShorten the programmed AV delay to 150 millisecondsIncrease the postventricular atrial refractory period to 250 millisecondsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's pacemaker is programmed to a DDDR (dual-chamber, rate-adaptive) pacing mode with an AV delay of 300 milliseconds and tracking rates from 60 to 110 pulses per minute. The postventricular atrial refractory period is programmed to 200 milliseconds. The patient's ECG shows a sinus rhythm with a rate of 60 beats per minute. The AV delay is prolonged at 300 milliseconds, and the postventricular atrial refractory period is normal at 200 milliseconds. The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness and fatigue are likely due to his slow heart rate. Increasing the atrial pacing rate to 70 beats per minute will increase the patient's cardiac output and improve his symptoms. Shortening the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds will allow for more blood to flow into the ventricles before they are paced, which will also improve the patient's cardiac output. Increasing the postventricular atrial refractory period to 250 milliseconds will prevent the pacemaker from pacing the atria too quickly, which could lead to atrial arrhythmias. Referencing the patient for pacemaker lead revision is not necessary at this time.

Answer: A. Increase the atrial pacing rate to 70 beats per minute.

Title: New Painful Nodules in a Patient With Multiple Myeloma Case is: A woman in her 60s presented for evaluation of multiple painful cutaneous nodules that had developed over the previous 2 months. The patient had a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, diagnosed approximately 6 months earlier. At that time, flow cytometry showed a κ-restricted plasma cell population positive for CD38 and CD138 but negative for CD3, CD20, and CD45 expression. Cytogenetic analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization did not reveal high-risk genetic markers. The patient demonstrated no evidence of end organ disease, and her myeloma was classified as stage II. Since her initial diagnosis, she had completed 4 cycles of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) therapy in addition to irradiation for lytic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Physical examination revealed scattered red-violaceous nodules, with the largest measuring approximately 6.0 × 5.5 × 2.5 cm (Figure, A). They were found in the mouth, the trunk, and on all 4 extremities. The lesions were nonulcerated, round with a smooth surface, fixed, and firm and tender to touch. Serum protein levels were normal. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis of the largest lesion on the patient’s right shoulder were performed (Figure, B and C).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Hemangioma , B: Neutrophilic dermatoses , C: Plasmacytoma , D: Leukemia cutis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient in this case has a history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, which is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells. Plasma cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies. In multiple myeloma, these cells become abnormal and multiply out of control. This can lead to the formation of tumors in the bone marrow, as well as other problems such as anemia, kidney failure, and bone fractures.

The patient in this case has developed multiple painful cutaneous nodules. These nodules are likely due to the spread of cancer cells from the bone marrow to the skin. The nodules are described as being nonulcerated, round with a smooth surface, fixed, and firm and tender to touch. These features are consistent with the diagnosis of plasmacytoma, which is a type of tumor that is composed of plasma cells.

Plasmacytomas can occur in the bone marrow or in other organs, such as the skin. When they occur in the skin, they are called cutaneous plasmacytomas. Cutaneous plasmacytomas are often the first sign of multiple myeloma.

The diagnosis of plasmacytoma is made based on a biopsy of the affected tissue. The biopsy will show the presence of abnormal plasma cells. Immunohistochemical staining can be used to further characterize the plasma cells.

The treatment of plasmacytoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, the tumor can often be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. In more advanced disease, chemotherapy may be necessary.

The patient does not meet criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient is not at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the results reflect colonization.

**Answer:**

C. The patient does not meet criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

The patient has a number of risk factors for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, including his underlying granulomatous polyangiitis, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary fibrosis. However, he does not have any of the clinical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, such as fever, chills, or hypoxemia. His chest CT scan shows bilateral nodular infiltrates and a 1.3-cm cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe, but these findings are not specific for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. His blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid test results are also negative for Aspergillus galactomannan, which is a sensitive and specific marker for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

In conclusion, the patient does not meet criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Title: Urine Drug Screens to Monitor Opioid Use for Managing Chronic Pain Case is: A 53-year-old woman presented for a prescription refill of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10 mg/325 mg. She had chronic low back pain and partial paralysis from a thoracic spinal cord infarction, secondary to aortic dissection from prior cocaine use. Taking 2 to 3 tablets of hydrocodone/acetaminophen daily improved her back pain from 5 to 2 on a 10-point scale. She reported no recent illicit substance or drug use and stated her last dose of hydrocodone was that day. The patient had not achieved pain control with prior nonopioid pharmacologic pain management, including duloxetine and gabapentin. Although past cocaine use was a risk factor for opioid misuse, a trial of hydrocodone was initiated, after discussion of risks and benefits, with a plan for careful monitoring. The state prescription drug monitoring program showed no other prescribers of controlled substances. A urine immunoassay drug screen was ordered to evaluate for medication misuse and illicit use (Table).The patient is not using hydrocodone but is using cocaine.The patient is not using hydrocodone but may be using cocaine.The patient may be using hydrocodone but is using cocaine.The patient may be using both hydrocodone and cocaine.How Would You Interpret These Results?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's urine drug screen showed the presence of cocaine, but not hydrocodone. This suggests that the patient may be using cocaine, but not hydrocodone. However, it is also possible that the patient is using both hydrocodone and cocaine, but the hydrocodone is not being detected by the urine drug screen. The urine drug screen may not be able to detect hydrocodone if the patient has taken a large enough dose, or if the patient has taken hydrocodone with other medications that can interfere with the test. Additionally, the patient may be using a synthetic opioid that is not detected by the urine drug screen.

Title: Antiphospholipid Antibodies Case is: A 39-year-old man with a history of ischemic stroke 10 years ago presented after 1 day of right calf swelling and shortness of breath. He reported no trauma, surgery, recent prolonged mobility limitation, or family history of thrombosis. His only medication was aspirin, 81 mg daily. On examination, his heart rate was 106/min, respiratory rate was 28/min, and swelling of the right calf was noted. A heparin drip was initiated for suspected pulmonary embolism, which was confirmed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography. Routine laboratory values were unremarkable. Warfarin was administered for long-term anticoagulation. Given the unprovoked thrombotic events at a young age, a hypercoagulable state was suspected, and testing for the antiphospholipid syndrome was performed. Two days later, results revealed elevated titers of anticardiolipin and anti–β2 glycoprotein I antibodies and negative lupus anticoagulant screening assays (Table 1).Results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.How Would You Interpret These Test Results? A: Results are sufficient to diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome. , B: Results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. , C: Results are uninterpretable due to heparin therapy. , D: Results are uninterpretable due to warfarin therapy..

He now presents with generalized phymatous changes affecting his entire face, as well as a few pustular lesions and a diffuse erythema that gives him an appearance of leonine facies. He complains of substantial, progressive seborrheic hyperplasia and flushing episodes over the past year, accompanied by ocular manifestations that included swelling of his eyelids. Ophthalmological examination showed features of chronic blepharitis and lagophthalmos. Detailed anamnesis revealed a history of intense diarrhea in prior months. A biopsy specimen from the skin of the forehead was obtained and analyzed under hematoxylin-eosin staining. A computed tomography (CT) scan completed the etiological investigation.

The patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that is characterized by flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and right-sided heart failure. It is caused by the release of vasoactive substances, such as serotonin, from carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors can occur in any part of the body, but they are most commonly found in the small intestine, appendix, and lungs.

The patient's history of hypertension and a pulmonary tumor that was resected 10 years earlier raises the possibility that his carcinoid tumor originated in the lung. The presence of generalized phymatous changes, pustular lesions, and diffuse erythema on his face is characteristic of carcinoid syndrome. The patient's ocular manifestations, including swelling of his eyelids, are also consistent with carcinoid syndrome. The findings of a biopsy specimen from the skin of the forehead, which showed a scarce lymphocytic infiltrate close to follicular structure along with sebaceous hyperplasia, are also consistent with carcinoid syndrome. The CT scan, which showed multiple metastatic hepatic masses, is further evidence of a carcinoid tumor.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has a clinical presentation that is most consistent with the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. The findings of the biopsy specimen and the CT scan support this diagnosis.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 50s with a history of itching skin lesions that have been present for months and increased gradually. The lesions are located on her trunk and are described as multiple flaccid pustules on scaly, erythematous plaques with an annular and circinate pattern. Mucosae are unaffected. Treatment with topical steroids has shown no lasting effect.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes tinea corporis, IgA pemphigus, Duhring disease, and psoriasis pustulosa. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the skin that typically presents with annular or circinate lesions with central clearing. IgA pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease that typically presents with flaccid pustules on an erythematous base. Duhring disease is a rare inflammatory skin disease that typically presents with annular lesions with central clearing and a serpiginous border. Psoriasis pustulosa is a severe form of psoriasis that typically presents with pustules on an erythematous base.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is IgA pemphigus. This is supported by the patient's history of itching skin lesions that have been present for months and increased gradually, the location of the lesions on her trunk, the description of the lesions as multiple flaccid pustules on scaly, erythematous plaques with an annular and circinate pattern, and the lack of response to treatment with topical steroids.

**Answer:**
The diagnosis is IgA pemphigus.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
**Reasoning:** The patient is a woman in her 50s who presents with itching skin lesions that have been present for months and increased gradually. The lesions are located on the trunk and are annular and circinate in shape. There is no involvement of the mucosae. Treatment with topical steroids has not been effective.

The differential diagnosis includes tinea corporis, IgA pemphigus, Duhring disease, and psoriasis pustulosa. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the skin that typically presents with annular, scaly lesions. IgA pemphigus is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters to form in the skin. Duhring disease is a rare skin condition that causes blisters, papules, and pustules to form on the skin. Psoriasis pustulosa is a severe form of psoriasis that causes pustules to form on the skin.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of IgA pemphigus. The annular and circinate shape of the lesions, the lack of involvement of the mucosae, and the failure of treatment with topical steroids are all characteristic of IgA pemphigus.

Title: Gray-Violet Plaque in an Immunocompromised Girl Case is: A 4-year-old girl with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, receiving her initial course of chemotherapy with vincristine, daunorubicin, and methotrexate, developed a painful lesion on her left triceps. The tender area was beneath an adhesive bandage placed where she had received DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and polio vaccinations 3 weeks earlier. Otherwise, she appeared remarkably well, and her vital signs were normal. Removing the bandage revealed a tender indurated gray-violet plaque (Figure, A). White blood cell and neutrophil counts were low at 0.4 K/μL (normal range, 4.86-13.18 K/μL) and 0.18 K/μL (normal range, 1.60-8.29 K/μL), respectively. Blood culture findings were negative.

Reasoning: The patient is a 4-year-old girl with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, receiving her initial course of chemotherapy with vincristine, daunorubicin, and methotrexate. She developed a painful lesion on her left triceps beneath an adhesive bandage placed where she had received DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and polio vaccinations 3 weeks earlier. The tender area was indurated and gray-violet in color. White blood cell and neutrophil counts were low at 0.4 K/μL and 0.18 K/μL, respectively. Blood culture findings were negative. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathologic analysis and fungal culture.

The histopathologic examination revealed broad nonseptate hyphae surrounding and infiltrating dermal blood vessels. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with leukemia. It is caused by fungi in the genus Mucor. The most common form of mucormycosis is rhinocerebral mucormycosis, which affects the nose, sinuses, and brain. Other forms of mucormycosis can affect the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract.

The diagnosis of mucormycosis is made based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment of mucormycosis is challenging and often unsuccessful. The goal of treatment is to control the infection and prevent spread to other parts of the body. Treatment may include surgery, antifungal medications, and supportive care.

Title: Neonate With Cutaneous Vesicles and Respiratory Distress Case is: A 3-day-old premature male infant, born at 26 weeks’ gestational age, presented to the dermatology department with a skin rash on the bilateral lower extremities.  History was notable for preterm premature rupture of membranes for 10 days. The neonate was born via urgent cesarean delivery owing to breech positioning. The mother was otherwise in good health with normal prenatal care and had no history of sexually transmitted diseases. During the first few days of life, the neonate had recurrent hypoxic episodes. He was receiving intravenous antibiotics for suspected sepsis and bacitracin for the topical lesions. Per the primary team, the rash was first noted at 3 days of life.Physical examination demonstrated a small, ill-appearing neonate with multiple, grouped vesicles and punched-out ulcerations on his scalp, axilla, extremities, and scrotum (Figure, A-D). He also had witnessed respiratory desaturations requiring urgent intubation. Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated a normal complete blood cell count and serum chemistry with the exception of a high lymphocyte count (34%, normal level <25% [to convert to proportion of 1.0, multiply by 0.01]) and high aspartate aminotransferase level (117 IU/L, normal level 8-39 IU/L  [to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167]).

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the upper quadrants of the left breast with edema and palpable axillary lymph nodes without clinical signs of inflammation or infection. She had neither fever nor skin redness but was experiencing fatigue. She had stopped breastfeeding 10 months before the emergency department admission, and she had a recent history of pneumonia self-medicated with antibiotics. She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and no history of drug addiction or hyaluronic acid or free silicone injections in the breast. She denied any trauma to the breast.

On physical examination, the patient had a 6-cm hard mass without nipple discharge or retraction and left axillary palpable lymph nodes. Breast ultrasonography revealed diffuse nonspecific hypoechogenicity of the breast tissue with periductal small cysts. Mammography revealed asymmetric density and distortion in the left upper quadrants.

Multiple 14-gauge ultrasound-guided biopsies in the upper quadrants of the left breast and fine-needle aspiration cytologic testing of an enlarged lymph node revealed granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Lymph nodes were normal.

Blood test results were as follows: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and whole-blood interferon γ release assay (QuantiFERON), negative; IgG cytomegalovirus, positive; fibrinogen level, 234 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 4 mm/h; leukocyte count, 7660/µL; no acquired immunosuppression; and no hematologic disorders.

The differential diagnosis for a young woman with a breast mass includes inflammatory breast cancer, tuberculous mastitis, idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, and mastitis caused by immunosuppression.

Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare but aggressive form of breast cancer that typically presents with a sudden, painful enlargement of the breast. It is often associated with fever, skin redness, and edema. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, which shows a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the breast tissue.

Tuberculous mastitis is a rare infection of the breast that is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It typically presents with a painless, slowly enlarging mass in the breast. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, which shows granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast bacilli.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare inflammatory condition of the breast that is of unknown cause. It typically presents with a painful, tender mass in the breast. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, which shows granulomatous inflammation without evidence of infection.

Mastitis caused by immunosuppression is a rare complication of immunosuppressive therapy. It typically presents with a painful, tender mass in the breast. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, which shows granulomatous inflammation with evidence of infection.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. She is a young woman with a sudden, painful enlargement of the breast without fever, skin redness, or edema. The biopsy shows granulomatous inflammation without evidence of infection. The blood test results are negative for infectious diseases and immunosuppression.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is idiopathic granulomatous mastitis.

Title: An Incidental Hypervascular Retroperitoneal Mass Case is: A 69-year-old white man presented to the emergency department after a tractor-on-tree collision. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated an incidental right infrarenal, retroperitoneal mass measuring 9.7 × 7.7 × 9.1 cm (Figure 1A), with dilated tortuous supply from a lumbar artery branch and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. He denied any history of systemic symptoms, pain, urinary symptoms, or abnormal bowel function but described 6 years of decreased appetite. Laboratory evaluation of plasma-free metanephrine levels showed a slight elevation in normetanephrine levels (1.21 nmol/L). Given the dramatic arterial enhancement and hypertrophied perivascular plexus, biopsy was not performed, and preoperative arterial embolization was deemed appropriate to minimize intraoperative blood loss.A, Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan demonstrating an incidental right infrarenal, retroperitoneal mass measuring 9.7 × 7.7 × 9.1 cm, with dilated tortuous supply from a lumbar artery branch. B, Flush aortogram outlining supply to the mass from a hypertrophied lumbar artery (blue arrowhead) and from a branch of the internal iliac artery (red arrowhead).At preoperative embolization, initial aortography identified the predominant lumbar artery branch and also demonstrated supply from a branch of the internal iliac artery (Figure 1B). These branches were embolized and the mass was devascularized. Twenty-four hours following embolization, surgical exploration was performed through a periumbilical midline incision. With no evidence of distant metastasis (peritoneal or liver), the mass was resected with partial resection of the iliopsoas muscle to achieve negative margins in conjunction with aortocaval lymphadenectomy of the enlarged lymph nodes. The mass was running parallel to the right ureter, which was meticulously dissected, and the right kidney was successfully saved. There were no complications, and the postoperative course was uneventful.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Angiosarcoma , B: Leiomyosarcoma , C: Pheochromocytoma , D: Unicentric Castleman disease.

Title: Bilateral Retinal Problem in a Patient With Alport Syndrome Case is: A man in his late 20s with a history of Alport syndrome presented on referral for a bilateral retina problem after experiencing right-sided herpes zoster ophthalmicus. He denied risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus, and serologic testing results were negative. He had completed treatment for keratouveitis and reported some residual blurring of his vision in the right eye. His ocular history was unremarkable. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Pupillary responses, confrontation visual fields, motility, external examination, and intraocular pressure were normal. Slitlamp examination revealed superficial keratitis and anterior stromal haze in the right eye but otherwise was normal. Fundus examination (Figure, A) revealed a poor foveal light reflex with an irregular-shaped area of red discoloration in the fovea and surrounding subtle flecking of the retina in both eyes. No other abnormalities were found on ophthalmoscopic examination. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Figure, B) showed an irregular foveal contour with trace epiretinal membrane formation, with no evidence of foveoschisis or outer retinal changes. Fundus autofluorescence was normal.A, Color fundus photograph demonstrating pseudohole formation with pigment mottling, right eye.

Reasoning: The patient has a history of Alport syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that can cause kidney disease, hearing loss, and retinal problems. The patient also has a history of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the retina. The patient's current symptoms include blurred vision, a poor foveal light reflex, and an irregular-shaped area of red discoloration in the fovea. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of pseudohole formation, which is a condition that can develop as a complication of herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

Treatment for pseudohole formation typically involves observation and repeat spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 6 months to 1 year. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the epiretinal membrane that is causing the pseudohole. However, surgery is not always necessary and can sometimes worsen the patient's vision.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are mild and there is no evidence of active inflammation in the retina. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe the patient and repeat OCT in 6 months to 1 year. If the patient's symptoms worsen or the pseudohole progresses, then surgery may be necessary.

The jaw became more painful and fatigued with chewing, associated with an 3.6-kg weight loss over 3 months. A mouth guard prescribed by her dentist for temporomandibular joint disease had provided substantial relief over the past 2 months. She denied any history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, or human immunodeficiency virus exposure but had a 20 pack/year cigarette smoking history.Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/25 OU. Automated perimetry revealed a small paracentral relative scotoma in the left eye. Superficial temporal artery pulses were palpable without tenderness, and anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed healthy-appearing optic discs in both eyes and an arc-shaped area of retinal whitening in the nasal macula concentric to the optic disc in the left eye (Figure 1, A). No intra-arterial plaques were noted. Optical coherence tomography through the lesion showed localized hyperreflectivity and thickening of the retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers (Figure 1, B). Fluorescein angiography revealed normal choroidal and retinal arterial perfusion. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 2 mm/h, C-reactive peptide level was 0.49 mg/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524), and platelet count was 270 ×103/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1).A, Fundus photograph shows a normal left optic disc with an adjacent arc-shaped patch of retinal whitening and no other macular pathology.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that typically affects people over the age of 50. GCA can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, jaw claudication, fever, and weight loss. The patient's history of jaw pain, right-sided jaw pain migrating to include both temples, ears, neck, and left shoulder, and an 3.6-kg weight loss over 3 months are consistent with GCA. The patient's physical examination is also consistent with GCA, with tenderness of the superficial temporal arteries. The fundus examination findings, including a small paracentral relative scotoma in the left eye and an arc-shaped area of retinal whitening in the nasal macula concentric to the optic disc in the left eye, are also consistent with GCA.

Answer: D. Start systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery.

The patient's presentation is concerning for GCA, which is a systemic vasculitis that can cause visual loss and other serious complications if not treated promptly. The first-line treatment for GCA is high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone. The patient should also undergo a biopsy of the superficial temporal artery to confirm the diagnosis of GCA.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a middle-aged woman with a circumscribed elevation of the right iris. She has no significant medical or family history, and review of symptoms is unremarkable. On examination, she has a corrected distance Snellen acuity of 20/20 OU, intraocular pressures of 12 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS, and a circumscribed elevation of the right iris inferotemporally. Her iris is uniformly pigmented, and gonioscopy reveals an iridocorneal angle open to scleral spur with a circumscribed area of iris insertion anterior to the Schwalbe line inferotemporally, not deepening on compression. Her lens is clear, and no iridociliary lesions are appreciated after pupillary dilation. The optic nerve and fundus appear normal. The left eye appears healthy with a uniformly deep anterior chamber.

The differential diagnosis for a circumscribed elevation of the iris includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. Benign conditions include iris cysts, iris nevi, and iris melanoma. Malignant conditions include uveal melanoma, metastatic carcinoma, and lymphoma.

In this case, the patient's age, lack of significant medical or family history, and unremarkable review of symptoms are all suggestive of a benign etiology. The circumscribed nature of the lesion, its location inferotemporally, and its appearance on gonioscopy are also consistent with a benign diagnosis.

Given the benign nature of the lesion, the next step in management is to observe the patient and repeat imaging in 6 months. If the lesion remains stable or regresses, no further treatment is necessary. If the lesion enlarges or changes in appearance, then a biopsy may be indicated.

Title: A Diver With Double Vision Case is: A 39-year-old man with a history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome presented with double vision after scuba diving. When he descended to 35 ft during his dive, the patient experienced blurred vision in the right eye and sharp pain in the right temporal area. At 50 ft of depth, vision in the right eye went completely black. He ascended back to the surface at an appropriate speed and his vision recovered, but he was left with a mild residual blur. This was associated with a pain and pressure sensation in the right eye lasting 30 minutes and noticeable bruising on the right upper eyelid. After this episode, he noticed constant, binocular, diagonal diplopia in all gazes that was worse in upgaze.He was seen in our ophthalmology clinic the next day. His visual blur had resolved, but double vision persisted. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OU. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Color vision tested with Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates was normal. Confrontation visual fields were full in both eyes. He had restricted supraduction and proptosis of 2.5 mm in the right eye. Intraocular pressure was 10 mm Hg OU. There was ecchymosis of the right upper eyelid. Results of dilated eye examination were unremarkable. 24-2 Humphrey visual fields were normal in both eyes. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head showed no vascular abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed a fusiform heterogeneous peripherally enhancing extraconal mass within the superior orbit on the right, resulting in proptosis with downward displacement of the right globe (Figure).T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of orbit with contrast shows a fusiform heterogeneous peripherally enhancing extraconal mass within the superior orbit on the right (arrowhead), resulting in proptosis with downward displacement of the right globe.What Would You Do Next? A: Observe , B: Perform canthotomy and cantholysis , C: Perform fine-needle aspiration , D: Perform a surgical drainage of the collection. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessels throughout the body. This can lead to a variety of problems, including bleeding, aneurysms, and tumors. In this case, the patient has developed a tumor in the right orbit. This tumor is causing double vision, proptosis, and ecchymosis of the right upper eyelid.

The next step in management is to determine the nature of the tumor. This can be done with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The MRI scan shows a fusiform heterogeneous peripherally enhancing extraconal mass within the superior orbit on the right. This is consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.

Cavernous hemangiomas are benign tumors that are made up of large, dilated blood vessels. They are the most common type of orbital tumor. Cavernous hemangiomas can grow slowly or rapidly. They can also cause a variety of symptoms, including double vision, proptosis, and ecchymosis of the upper eyelid.

The treatment of cavernous hemangiomas depends on the size and location of the tumor. Small tumors that are not causing any symptoms may be observed without treatment. Larger tumors or tumors that are causing symptoms may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or embolization.

In this case, the patient has a large tumor that is causing double vision, proptosis, and ecchymosis of the upper eyelid. The tumor is also located in a difficult-to-access area. Therefore, the best treatment option is to perform a surgical drainage of the collection.

Title: Arrhythmia in Bone Marrow Transplant Unit Case is: A 35-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplant approximately 9 months prior presented to the emergency department with concern of shortness of breath and productive cough for a week. Her bone marrow transplant had been complicated with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of skin and liver, diagnosed by biopsies 1 month after her transplant. In the emergency department, chest radiography showed multifocal airspace consolidations involving both lungs. Because of respiratory distress, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. She was subsequently diagnosed as having methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Respiratory failure developed, and the patient was intubated and treated with vasopressors. After 3 days in the intensive care unit, vasopressors were weaned off, and she was extubated. On hospital day 5, she was noted to have generalized erythematous skin with mild elevated liver enzyme, suggesting acute flare of chronic GVHD. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Her hospital course was complicated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, possibly from pulmonary GVHD. Steroid and immunosuppressive medication doses were increased, and pulse methylprednisolone was started. At 48 hours after her skin lesions flared up, a change in her rhythm was noted on telemetry: her baseline sinus rhythm with heart rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm) was changed to bradycardia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in the Figure. Her baseline ECG obtained a day earlier showed normal sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (PR interval of 240 milliseconds). The patient denied symptoms associated with bradycardia.What Would You Do Next? A: Place a dual chamber pacemaker , B: Observe and continue treatment for GVHD , C: Place an emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker , D: Place an emergent transcutaneous pacemaker. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplant approximately 9 months prior. Her bone marrow transplant had been complicated with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of skin and liver, diagnosed by biopsies 1 month after her transplant. She is currently in the hospital with acute flare of chronic GVHD, complicated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She is receiving steroids and immunosuppressive medications.

The patient's ECG shows sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 45 beats per minute. She is asymptomatic.

The first step in management is to determine whether the bradycardia is symptomatic. If the patient is symptomatic, such as with dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope, then a pacemaker should be placed emergently. If the patient is asymptomatic, then the next step is to determine the cause of the bradycardia.

In this case, the most likely cause of the bradycardia is the patient's GVHD. GVHD can affect the heart in a number of ways, including by causing inflammation of the conduction system, which can lead to bradycardia.

Other possible causes of the bradycardia include medications, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypothyroidism.

Once the cause of the bradycardia has been determined, the next step is to determine the best treatment. In this case, the patient is asymptomatic and the most likely cause of the bradycardia is her GVHD. Therefore, the best treatment is to continue her current medications and to observe her closely.

If the patient becomes symptomatic, then a pacemaker should be placed emergently.

Answer:
B. Observe and continue treatment for GVHD

Title: Nocturnal Dyspnea as a Result of a Hypopharyngeal Mass Case is: A man in his 60s presented with progressive onset of nocturnal dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and noisy breathing over the previous year. In addition, he reported a 22.7-kg weight loss. He also had a medical history significant for obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease with Barrett esophagitis, diabetes, and degenerative joint disease. Findings from his head and neck physical examination were normal except for the laryngeal examination. Laryngeal endoscopy revealed a large, well-mucosalized mass emanating from the left pyriform sinus, with mass effect on the larynx (Figure, A). The bilateral true vocal folds (TVFs) were visualized and were normal, but the full range of mobility of the left TVF could not be assessed owing to mass effect. A computed tomographic scan with contrast of the neck was obtained and revealed a 5 × 6-cm, nonenhancing, well-circumscribed laryngeal mass (Figure, B). The tumor was originating from the left pyriform sinus and did not appear to be locally invasive. Given these findings, the patient underwent direct laryngoscopy for transoral carbon dioxide laser–assisted excision without complications. Microscopic examination of the mass demonstrated polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations (Figure, C). Postoperatively, the patient reported improvement in dysphagia, voice quality, sleep, and breathing patterns.A, A large left pyriform sinus mass with mass effect on the larynx.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a man in his 60s who presents with progressive onset of nocturnal dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and noisy breathing over the previous year. In addition, he reported a 22.7-kg weight loss. He also had a medical history significant for obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease with Barrett esophagitis, diabetes, and degenerative joint disease.

The tumor was originating from the left pyriform sinus and did not appear to be locally invasive. Given these findings, the patient underwent direct laryngoscopy for transoral carbon dioxide laser–assisted excision without complications. Microscopic examination of the mass demonstrated polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations. Postoperatively, the patient reported improvement in dysphagia, voice quality, sleep, and breathing patterns.

The most likely diagnosis is a granular cell tumor. Granular cell tumors are benign mesenchymal neoplasms that typically occur in the skin, oral cavity, and larynx. They are composed of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm containing characteristic cytoplasmic granules. Granular cell tumors are usually asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms related to mass effect, such as dysphagia, dysphonia, and dyspnea. The diagnosis is made on biopsy, and treatment is typically surgical excision.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Rhabdomyomas are rare, benign tumors of skeletal muscle. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are most often found in the heart. Granular cell tumors are much more common than rhabdomyomas. Paragangliomas are rare, neuroendocrine tumors that can occur in any location along the sympathetic or parasympathetic chain. They are most often found in the head and neck, and can cause symptoms related to mass effect, such as Horner syndrome, facial pain, and hoarseness. Hibernomas are rare, benign tumors of fat. They are most often found in the extremities, and can cause symptoms related to mass effect, such as pain, swelling, and numbness.

**Answer:**
The answer is B: Granular cell tumor.

Title: Expanding Purpura in a Neutropenic Patient Case is: A man in his 40s with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) arising from myelodysplasia presented with fever, cough, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and 1 month of neutropenia. He had abruptly developed a painful eruption on his scalp, face, and left leg 24 hours prior to presentation after being scratched in these areas by his pet cat. The patient had not received any chemotherapy or antimicrobial prophylaxis. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing, diaphoretic, thin man with multiple erythematous to violaceous, tender, edematous, targetoid nodules and plaques with central dusky appearance on the left forearm and right upper thigh (Figure, A). Vital signs included temperature of 39.7° C, blood pressure of 141/69 mm Hg, and pulse of 122 bpm. His white blood cell count was 1.8 × 103/µL (reference range, 4.5-11 × 103/µL; to convert to ×109/L, multiply by .001), and absolute neutrophil count was 246 cells/µL (reference range, 1520-6370 cells/µL). Other laboratory values were remarkable for a red blood cell count of 2.13 × 106/µL (reference range, 3.9-5.5 × 106/µL; to convert to ×1012/L, multiply by 1), hemoglobin of 6.1 g/dL (reference range, 14-17.5 g/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), and platelet count of 14 × 103/µL (reference range 150-350 × 103/µL, to convert to ×109/L, multiply 1).

Punch biopsy specimens from the right arm and left thigh were performed for histopathologic evaluation and tissue culture. A brisk neutrophilic infiltrate was seen on histopathology (Figure, B).

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is leukemia cutis. Leukemia cutis is a cutaneous manifestation of leukemia that occurs in approximately 10% of patients with acute leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of erythematous, violaceous, or purpuric papules, plaques, or nodules on the skin. The lesions are often tender and may be associated with fever, chills, and malaise. Leukemia cutis can be a sign of systemic disease and should be treated aggressively with chemotherapy.

Bartonella henselae infection is a zoonotic infection that is caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected cats. The most common clinical manifestation of Bartonella henselae infection is cat scratch disease, which is characterized by a regional lymphadenopathy. Other possible manifestations include fever, headache, fatigue, and a skin lesion at the site of the bite. Bartonella henselae infection is usually self-limited and does not require treatment. However, in some cases, it can lead to more serious complications, such as bacillary angiomatosis or peliosis hepatis.

Fusarium species infection is a fungal infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including cellulitis, folliculitis, and cutaneous aspergillosis. Fusarium species are often found in soil and water, and they can cause infection in people who have a weakened immune system. The most common clinical manifestation of Fusarium species infection is a skin lesion that is characterized by erythema, edema, and necrosis. Fusarium species infection can be treated with antifungal medications.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, self-limited neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and painful skin lesions. The lesions are often described as targetoid or annular, and they may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and arthralgias. Sweet syndrome is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response, and it is often associated with underlying medical conditions, such as hematologic malignancies, infections, and medications. Sweet syndrome is usually treated with corticosteroids, and it typically resolves within a few weeks.

Title: A Woman With Purple Macules on the Legs Case is: A 30-year-old woman presented with widespread, erythematous, purpuric macules and papules on the abdomen and extremities. The eruption had been present for approximately 8 months and consisted of asymptomatic, self-resolving, and continuously appearing macules and papules. Her medical history was significant for chronic hepatitis B infection, for which tenofovir was initiated 4 months ago. Review of systems was positive only for occasional arthralgias in her knees and ankles. She was not taking any other medications.The patient was in no acute distress, and her vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, there were purpuric, erythematous macules coalescing into patches on the upper extremities, abdomen, and lower extremities (Figure). She had no oral or genital involvement and no joint effusions or deformities. A skin punch biopsy showed extravasated erythrocytes, a neutrophilic infiltrate, fibrinoid necrosis, and broken-down neutrophils releasing nuclear debris, consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Figure). A second skin punch biopsy was performed for direct immunofluorescence, which was negative. Results of a complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were unremarkable.Physical examination of the lower extremities. Dotted areas indicate areas of the skin that were biopsied. Inset, Photomicrograph from first skin punch biopsy (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×200).What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a type of small vessel vasculitis that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, drugs, and autoimmune diseases. In this case, the patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a known risk factor for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient's skin lesions are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the skin biopsy findings confirm the diagnosis.

The next step in management is to evaluate the patient for systemic involvement. Systemic vasculitis can involve the kidneys, lungs, heart, and other organs, and can be life-threatening. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and she does not have any symptoms of systemic involvement, such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. However, it is important to evaluate her for systemic involvement, as early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes.

The patient should have a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, and chest X-ray. If these tests are normal, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of systemic involvement. If she develops any symptoms of systemic involvement, she should be treated with systemic corticosteroids.

The patient is a woman in her early 20s with a 1-year history of discrete asymptomatic brown lesions distributed over her lower extremities. The lesions are 2-mm to 4-mm round, hyperpigmented macules symmetrically distributed over the lower extremities and dorsal feet. There is no history of trauma or prior lesions at these sites. The patient denies fever, arthralgias, myalgias, or constitutional symptoms. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications or supplements. A skin biopsy was performed, which showed a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with pigment incontinence.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes lichen planus pigmentosus, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, macular lymphocytic arteritis, and erythema dyschromicum perstans. Lichen planus pigmentosus is a chronic, papulosquamous eruption characterized by hyperpigmented macules and papules. It is most commonly seen in women in their 30s and 40s. The lesions are typically found on the lower extremities, but they can also occur on the trunk, arms, and legs. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by the presence of leukocytoclasis (neutrophil nuclear debris) in the walls of small blood vessels. It can present with a variety of skin lesions, including palpable purpura, urticarial lesions, and livedo reticularis. Macular lymphocytic arteritis is a rare, chronic vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries. It is characterized by the presence of a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with pigment incontinence. Erythema dyschromicum perstans is a chronic, idiopathic skin disorder characterized by the development of hyperpigmented macules and patches. It is most commonly seen in young adults and adolescents.

A: Xanthogranuloma , B: Erdheim-Chester disease , C: Xanthoma disseminatum , D: Generalized eruptive histiocytoma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient is a woman in her 20s who presented with numerous grouped yellow-brown and red-brown papules on the upper eyelids, infraorbital rims, bilateral axillae, inframammary creases, lower back, buttocks, hips, inguinal folds, and proximal thighs. The lesions first appeared in her right axilla 6 months prior and were asymptomatic. The patient also noted a 3-month history of polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. Review of symptoms was otherwise negative. She had no notable medical or family history. On physical examination there were no other sites of involvement including mucosal surfaces. Shave biopsies were obtained from the right and left axillae and sent for histopathological examination.

The differential diagnosis of a papular eruption with polyuria and polydipsia includes xanthoma disseminatum, Erdheim-Chester disease, and generalized eruptive histiocytoma. Xanthogranuloma is a rare, benign inflammatory condition that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the formation of yellow-brown papules and nodules on the skin, particularly the eyelids and face. The lesions are often associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The histopathology of xanthogranuloma shows a perivascular infiltrate of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils.

Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically affects middle-aged and older adults. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the bone, skin, and other organs. The lesions are often associated with fever, weight loss, and fatigue. The histopathology of Erdheim-Chester disease shows a storiform fibrosis with multinucleated giant cells.

Generalized eruptive histiocytoma is a rare, benign histiocytosis that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the formation of multiple, small, red-brown papules on the skin. The lesions are often associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The histopathology of generalized eruptive histiocytoma shows a proliferation of histiocytes in the dermis.

In this case, the patient's history of polyuria and polydipsia is a clue to the diagnosis of xanthoma disseminatum. Xanthogranuloma, Erdheim-Chester disease, and generalized eruptive histiocytoma are not typically associated with polyuria and polydipsia.

The histopathology of the shave biopsies shows a proliferation of histiocytes in the dermis. This is consistent with the diagnosis of xanthoma disseminatum.

**Answer:** The diagnosis is xanthoma disseminatum.
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
**Reasoning:** The patient is a young woman with a 3-month history of polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. She has no other notable medical or family history. On physical examination, she has numerous grouped yellow-brown and red-brown papules on the upper eyelids, infraorbital rims, bilateral axillae, inframammary creases, lower back, buttocks, hips, inguinal folds, and proximal thighs. There are no other sites of involvement including mucosal surfaces. Shave biopsies were obtained from the right and left axillae and sent for histopathological examination.

The most likely diagnosis is generalized eruptive histiocytoma (GEH). GEH is a rare, benign, self-limited skin condition that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the eruption of multiple yellow-brown papules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. The histopathology of GEH shows a proliferation of histiocytes in the dermis.

The differential diagnosis of GEH includes xanthoma disseminatum, Erdheim-Chester disease, and xanthogranuloma. Xanthomatosis disseminatum is a rare, chronic, multisystem disease characterized by the deposition of lipid-laden histiocytes in the skin, bones, and other organs. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, chronic, multisystem disease characterized by the deposition of lipid-laden histiocytes in the skin, bones, and other organs. Xanthogranuloma is a rare, benign, self-limited skin condition that typically affects children. It is characterized by the eruption of multiple yellow-brown papules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. The histopathology of xanthogranuloma shows a proliferation of histiocytes in the dermis.

Title: Acral Bullae in a Young Girl Case is: A young girl presented to the pediatric emergency department for evaluation of blisters on both of her hands. Three weeks prior, she had returned from school with 2 itchy papules on her right hand. The papules continued to enlarge over the course of the day and progressed to form blisters. The following day, she noticed similar lesions appearing on her left hand. She was evaluated by her pediatrician, who prescribed oral cefdinir and hydrocortisone, 2.5%, cream, but there was no substantive improvement. On further questioning, she recalled similar itchy papules appearing on her feet without progression to blisters. Her medical history was significant for atopic dermatitis that was well controlled with topical triamcinolone, 0.1%, cream. Physical examination demonstrated numerous skin-colored tense bullae on her bilateral hands (Figure 1, A). Xerosis was on the trunk and extremities. On her dorsal and plantar feet, there were macerated, erosive plaques without vesicles or bullae (Figure 1, B). Results of herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction, bacterial culture, potassium hydroxide preparation, mineral oil preparation, and direct immunofluorescence were negative.A, Bilateral palms with at least 20 tense, white-gold bullae, several with violaceous borders and overlying tapioca-like appearance, present diffusely but concentrated on the palmar surfaces. B, Bilateral dorsal feet with macerated, erosive plaques. No active vesicles or bullae present.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Childhood bullous pemphigoid , B: Dyshidrotic eczema , C: Bullous tinea , D: Distal blistering dactylitis. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a young girl with a history of atopic dermatitis who presents with blisters on her hands and feet. The blisters are tense and skin-colored, and they are located on the palms and soles. There are also macerated, erosive plaques on the dorsal and plantar feet. The results of herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction, bacterial culture, potassium hydroxide preparation, mineral oil preparation, and direct immunofluorescence are negative.

The differential diagnosis includes childhood bullous pemphigoid, dyshidrotic eczema, bullous tinea, and distal blistering dactylitis.

Childhood bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that typically affects children under the age of 10. It is characterized by the development of tense bullae on the hands, feet, and mucous membranes. The blisters are often preceded by a prodrome of itching, burning, and pain.

Dyshidrotic eczema is a chronic eczematous condition that affects the palms and soles. It is characterized by the development of small, itchy blisters on the palms and soles. The blisters are often preceded by a prodrome of itching and burning.

Bullous tinea is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause the development of blisters. The blisters are often preceded by a prodrome of itching and burning.

Distal blistering dactylitis is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of blisters on the distal digits. The blisters are often preceded by a prodrome of itching and burning.

In this case, the most likely diagnosis is childhood bullous pemphigoid.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of abdominal discomfort and a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa. She denied any change in her bowel habits or having experienced rectal bleeding. She had a normal appetite and had no history of weight loss. Before this admission, she was healthy, with no previous medical problems. On examination, her vital signs were within normal limits. She was mildly tender in the right iliac fossa and there was a large mobile mass, at least 10 cm in diameter, that was easily palpable in the right iliac fossa. She was initially investigated with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen (Figure 1). She underwent a colonoscopy that showed no intraluminal mucosal abnormalities or masses, but evidence of external compression at the cecum was noted.

The CT scan shows a large, well-defined, cystic mass in the right iliac fossa. The mass is predominantly low-attenuation, with some internal septations. There is no evidence of calcification or lymphadenopathy. The findings are most consistent with a mucocele of the appendix.

A mucocele of the appendix is a cystic lesion that is lined by mucin-producing cells. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged women. The etiology of mucoceles is not fully understood, but they are thought to arise from obstruction of the appendix lumen. Mucoceles can be asymptomatic or can present with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is usually made with CT scan or colonoscopy. Treatment is surgical resection of the appendix.

**Answer:**

The answer is C. Mucocele of the appendix.

Title: Acute Pancreatitis After Pancreaticoduodenectomy Case is: A man in his 70s with history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had undergone a Whipple procedure 2 years prior to presentation came to the emergency department with a 1-day history of waxing and waning sharp abdominal pain radiating to his back. He admitted to nausea but no vomiting, fevers, or chills. He reported having normal bowel movements and passing flatus without difficulty. On examination, he was afebrile and not tachycardic. He had a well-healed abdominal midline wound. His abdomen was soft, not distended, and mildly tender diffusely, worse in the epigastrium, without rebound, guarding, or any palpable masses. His bloodwork revealed an elevated lipase level of 2842 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) without leukocytosis or any electrolyte abnormalities. Liver function test results were within normal limits.

Liver function test results were within normal limits. Given a history of pancreaticoduodenectomy, the patient underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast for further evaluation. The CT scan showed a tubular solid structure within the body of the stomach.

The most likely diagnosis is marginal ulcer. Marginal ulcers are common after pancreaticoduodenectomy, occurring in up to 20% of patients. They are thought to be caused by ischemia of the gastric mucosa due to disruption of the blood supply to the stomach during surgery. The symptoms of marginal ulcers are similar to those of peptic ulcers, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is made on endoscopy, which shows a crater-like ulcer in the gastric mucosa. Treatment is usually with acid-suppressing medications, such as proton pump inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the ulcer.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Tumor recurrence is possible, but the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of this. Afferent loop syndrome is a rare complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy, and it is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Internal hernia is also a rare complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy, and it is characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction.

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of an orbital mass. The imaging studies show a well-circumscribed, round, solid, and minimally enhancing soft tissue mass in the superotemporal left orbit with an adjacent bone excavation and no calcifications. These findings are most consistent with a benign mixed tumor. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to determine if the tumor is malignant. If the FNAB results are consistent with a benign mixed tumor, the patient can be observed without further treatment. However, if the FNAB results are suspicious for malignancy, an excisional biopsy should be performed.

**Reasoning:**

The patient in this case presents with a 2-week history of acute-onset, progressively worsening decreased vision and central scotomas in both eyes. The patient has no systemic symptoms and denies having eye redness, pain, and photophobia. His medical and surgical history includes prostate cancer, status postcryotherapy, osteoarthritis, and migraines. His social history is significant for active cigarette smoking and immigration from a Middle Eastern country. His medications include naproxen at 500 mg as needed, tamsulosin at 0.4 mg daily, and aspirin at 81 mg daily.

On examination, the patient's best-corrected visual acuities are 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. His pupils are reactive, his extraocular motility is full, and the intraocular pressures are 16 mm Hg in both eyes. The results of the external examination and anterior slitlamp examinations are unremarkable, and there is no anterior chamber or anterior vitreous cell or flare. The dilated fundus photography examination reveals yellow-gray, curvilinear, and puzzle piece–shaped subretinal macular lesions in both eyes.

Optical coherence tomography reveals that the involved areas exhibit a disruption of the outer retinal layers (including and deep to the outer nuclear layer) along with hyperreflectivity of the outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid. There is no involvement of the inner retina. The patient underwent laboratory testing for syphilis and tuberculosis, which yielded negative results.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes infectious etiologies such as syphilis and tuberculosis, as well as autoimmune disorders such as sarcoidosis and multifocal choroiditis. The patient's history of prostate cancer and status postcryotherapy raises the possibility of a secondary intraocular lymphoma.

The next step in management of this patient is to discuss the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in the treatment of infectious and autoimmune etiologies of multifocal choroiditis, but they can also have significant side effects, including cataracts, glaucoma, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. The decision of whether or not to initiate corticosteroid therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's individual risk factors and the severity of their disease.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of hypertension who presents to the emergency department experiencing chest pain and dyspnea. Her heart rate is 135 beats/min, and her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg. A 12-lead electrocardiogram documents wide complex tachycardia (WCT). Bedside transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for left ventricular ejection fraction 45% and moderate mitral regurgitation.

The most likely cause of the patient's WCT is ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The first priority in the management of VT is to restore a normal rhythm. This can be done with direct current cardioversion (DCCV), which is the delivery of a brief electric shock to the heart. DCCV is safe and effective in terminating VT.

Once VT has been terminated, the underlying cause of the arrhythmia should be investigated. In this patient, the most likely cause of VT is coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to chest pain, heart attack, and sudden cardiac death.

The patient should undergo coronary angiography, which is a procedure that uses X-rays to visualize the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Coronary angiography can be used to diagnose coronary artery disease and to determine if the patient is a candidate for revascularization, which is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked arteries.

Title: 24-Hour Urine Calcium in the Evaluation and Management of Nephrolithiasis Case is: A 29-year-old man presented for evaluation and management of recurrent nephrolithiasis. He passed his first kidney stone at age 27 and had 2 additional episodes of spontaneous stone passage. His stone analysis showed 95% calcium oxalate (CaOx) and 5% calcium phosphate. He had no other significant medical history. His only medication was tamulosin (α1a-adrenergic receptor antagonist), which was prescribed as needed for stone passage. His typical daily consumption included 3 dairy servings, 2 to 3 L of water, 1 to 2 servings of animal protein (meat, poultry, fish, and eggs), and restricted dietary salt. He reported no diarrhea or consumption of foods with high oxalate content (eg, spinach, beets, nuts, and chocolate). Family history was significant for nephrolithiasis in his mother. Physical examination results were unremarkable (body weight, 77 kg). Laboratory studies revealed normal serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, bicarbonate, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone. Twenty-four-hour urine studies are shown in the Table.The patient has hypercalciuria due to distal renal tubular acidosis.The patient has hypercalciuria due to high animal protein intake.The patient has hypercalciuria due to high salt intake.The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.How Would You Interpret These Results? A: The patient has hypercalciuria due to distal renal tubular acidosis. , B: The patient has hypercalciuria due to high animal protein intake. , C: The patient has hypercalciuria due to high salt intake. , D: The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient has a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis, with a stone analysis showing 95% calcium oxalate. This suggests that the patient is at risk for calcium oxalate stones. His serum calcium level is normal, which suggests that he does not have primary hyperparathyroidism. His 24-hour urine calcium excretion is 100 mg/day, which is above the upper limit of normal (<250 mg/day). This suggests that he has hypercalciuria.

There are several possible causes of hypercalciuria, including:

* Primary hyperparathyroidism
* Hypercalcemia of malignancy
* Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
* Idiopathic hypercalciuria

The patient's serum calcium level is normal, which makes primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of malignancy unlikely. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by low urinary calcium excretion despite hypercalcemia. The patient does not have a family history of this disorder, so it is also unlikely.

The most likely cause of the patient's hypercalciuria is idiopathic hypercalciuria. Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a common disorder that is characterized by increased urinary calcium excretion in the absence of an obvious cause. It is the most common cause of recurrent nephrolithiasis.

Answer:
The correct answer is D: The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Title: Diffuse Parotid Swelling From an Underlying Parotid Mass in a Pediatric Patient Case is: A 4-year-old white girl presented with left jaw pain and signs and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. Her medical history included recurrent acute otitis media requiring tympanostomy tube placement. On physical examination, the left parotid gland was diffusely full and firm, which was consistent with viral parotitis. Gland massage, warm compress, sialagogues, and increased hydration were recommended. At the 2-week follow-up, the swelling had largely resolved with a now-firm, slightly mobile, subcentimeter mass palpable in the anterior parotid gland. Four days later the mass enlarged and became painful. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study identified a 1.2 × 1.7 × 1.6-cm solid mass in the anterior parotid gland with well-defined borders and indention into the masseter muscle. The mass was isointense to muscle on T1, hyperintense on T2, with strong contrast enhancement, heterogeneous internal enhancement and a central focal area of hypointensity (Figure, A). The patient underwent a left superficial parotidectomy. Grossly the lesion was nonencapsulated, firm, dark colored, and was located within the anterior superficial lobe of the parotid gland. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of spindle cells with elongated nuclei in a storiform pattern embedded in moderately dense admixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with no atypia (Figure, B).

Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) was positive for activin-like kinase-1 (Alk-1) (Figure, C), vimentin, CD68, and factor XIIIa, and negative for smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, cytokeratin, and CD34.

The differential diagnosis for a parotid mass in a pediatric patient includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors include pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin tumor, and lymphangioma. Malignant tumors include rhabdomyosarcoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a benign parotid tumor. The MRI findings are also consistent with a benign tumor, as the mass is well-defined, has smooth borders, and is isointense to muscle on T1 and hyperintense on T2. The presence of a central focal area of hypointensity is concerning for a necrotic tumor, but this is not specific for any particular tumor type.

The histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMFT). IMFT is a rare, benign mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by a storiform pattern of spindle cells with admixed lymphocytes and histiocytes. The tumor is typically positive for vimentin and CD68, and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, cytokeratin, and CD34.

The IHC findings in this case are consistent with a diagnosis of IMFT. The tumor is positive for Alk-1, which is a marker that is typically expressed in IMFT. The tumor is also positive for vimentin and CD68, and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, cytokeratin, and CD34.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, MRI findings, and histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of IMFT.

Title: An HIV-Positive Child With a Gingival Mass Case is: A preadolescent girl presented with a 1-week history of left-sided facial swelling. She had presented 3 months prior with neurologic and vision changes and was diagnosed as having varicella zoster encephalitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis. Further testing led to a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, and at that time she was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy as well as bactrim prophylaxis. Physical examination revealed left-sided facial fullness and a left-sided violaceous, vascular-appearing lesion involving the left maxillary gingiva (Figure, A). The patient was afebrile, her white blood cell count was 3300/μL, and her CD4 count was 210 μg/mL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face revealed a poorly enhancing mass arising from the left maxilla and extending into the left maxillary sinus (Figure, B). An incisional biopsy was undertaken, during which excessive bleeding was encountered. Histologic analysis and immunophenotype of the specimen showed a dual population of lymphoma cells with plasmablasts having large vesicular nuclei and centrally located eosinophilic nucleoli and “plasmacytic” cells with comparatively smaller darker nuclei and smaller scanty nucleoli (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical expression was strongly positive for CD138 (Figure, D) and Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small nuclear RNA (EBV-EBER), and the Ki-67 index (marker of mitotic division) was greater than 90%, negative for CD45, CD20, HHV-8, TdT, CD34, PAX5, CD3, CD99, ALK-1, and CD30.

Title: A Supraclavicular Mass Case is: A man in his 70s presented with a 6-year history of a painless lump in his left supraclavicular region. Palpation detected a smooth, soft, and fluctuant mass in his left supraclavicular region. Fiberscopic examination of the pharynx and larynx revealed no abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a poorly circumscribed, heterogeneous, and cystic mass near the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). The SCM around the tumor was thickened, suggesting invasion of the SCM. There was no continuity between the tumor and the thyroid gland (Figure, A). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a poorly marginated, heterogeneous, and partially tubular mass. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed cystic elements but no atypical cells. Positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolism (maximum standardized uptake value, 1.6) in the mass, but no other hypermetabolic foci. At surgery, the tumor was attached to the medial side of the origin of the left SCM. No extensive adhesions were observed, and dissection of the tumor from the adjacent tissues was straightforward. The lesion measured 2.5 × 3.0 × 4.0 cm, was a solitary well-circumscribed roundish nodule with a thin capsule, and its cut surface had a yellowish white homogeneous surface (Figure, B). Pathological examination revealed that the mass comprised an irregular combination of squamous epithelial and spindle cells, with a mature adipose tissue component (Figure, C and D).

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a man in his 70s who presented with a 6-year history of a painless lump in his left supraclavicular region. The lump is smooth, soft, and fluctuant, and is located near the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Fiberscopic examination of the pharynx and larynx revealed no abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a poorly circumscribed, heterogeneous, and cystic mass near the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The SCM around the tumor was thickened, suggesting invasion of the SCM. There was no continuity between the tumor and the thyroid gland. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a poorly marginated, heterogeneous, and partially tubular mass. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed cystic elements but no atypical cells. Positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolism (maximum standardized uptake value, 1.6) in the mass, but no other hypermetabolic foci. At surgery, the tumor was attached to the medial side of the origin of the left SCM. No extensive adhesions were observed, and dissection of the tumor from the adjacent tissues was straightforward. The lesion measured 2.5 × 3.0 × 4.0 cm, was a solitary well-circumscribed roundish nodule with a thin capsule, and its cut surface had a yellowish white homogeneous surface. Pathological examination revealed that the mass comprised an irregular combination of squamous epithelial and spindle cells, with a mature adipose tissue component. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the epithelial component was diffusely positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3.

Based on the history, physical examination, imaging studies, and pathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is **ectopic hamartomatous thymoma**. Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in the anterior mediastinum. However, it can also occur in other locations, such as the neck. The tumor is composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, and is often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as cleft palate and cardiac defects. The treatment of ectopic hamartomatous thymoma is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent, with long-term survival rates of 90-100%.

**Answer:**
C. Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma

Title: Unilateral Nasal Congestion in an Elderly Man Case is: A man in his 70s presented to an outside institution with a 4-month history of right-sided nasal congestion, which failed to resolve with nasal sprays, antibiotics, and oral prednisone. He also reported intermittent right-sided epistaxis occurring multiple times per day. He had not experienced prior nasal trauma or surgery and had quit smoking 30 years ago. At the outside institution, a nasal mass was found on examination and biopsied. He was referred to our office for further management. Endoscopic examination showed a dark, soft-tissue mass filling the right nasal cavity. Computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses revealed opacification of the right nasal cavity with tissue protruding into the nasopharynx and complete opacification of the right maxillary, anterior ethmoid, and frontal sinuses (Figure, A and B). The patient underwent surgical resection. Removal of the mass required a right medial maxillectomy, septectomy, and excision of the right nasolacrimal duct via endoscopic approach. Resection also necessitated removal of the anterior maxillary sinus wall via Caldwell-Luc procedure. Biopsy specimens were taken throughout. Histopathologic analysis from both the outside hospital and our institution revealed sheets of atypical, pleomorphic epithelioid cells, some with prominent pigment (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for HMB-45 (Figure, D) and S-100.A and B, Noncontrast computed tomographic images of the paranasal sinuses. C and D, Histopathologic images.

Title: Epistaxis, Ecchymoses, and an Abnormal White Blood Cell Count Case is: A 42-year-old man presented with spontaneous ecchymoses of the extremities for the past 2 days and spontaneous epistaxis for the past 2 hours. He had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and allergic rhinitis. His medications included esomeprazole, fluticasone nasal spray, and supplemental cholecalciferol. Physical examination revealed multiple ecchymoses on the extremities and abdomen but was otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 2.4 × 103/µL, with 13% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, and 54% blasts. Hemoglobin level was 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count was 20 × 103/µL. Prothrombin time was 14.5 seconds; international normalized ratio, 1.4; partial thromboplastin time, 27 seconds; D-dimer level, 2.524 μg/mL (13.82 nmol/L); and fibrinogen level, 68 mg/dL (2 μmol/L).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is characterized by a high white blood cell count with a predominance of immature myeloid cells, known as promyelocytes. These cells can release a substance called promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), which can lead to bleeding and clotting problems. The patient's laboratory findings support the diagnosis of APL, with a white blood cell count of 2.4 × 103/µL, with 54% blasts. The peripheral blood smear shows promyelocytes with characteristic nuclear "faggot cells".

Answer: The next step in management is to consult a hematologist and administer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a drug that induces differentiation of promyelocytes and reduces the risk of bleeding and clotting complications. Cytoarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy are also used to treat APL, but they are not typically given as initial therapy. A central venous catheter may be placed in preparation for replacing blood products, but this is not necessary in all cases.

The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further management. He should be monitored for signs of bleeding, such as ecchymoses, epistaxis, and hematuria. He should also be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and leukopenia.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a rare and aggressive form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is characterized by a high white blood cell count with a predominance of immature myeloid cells, known as promyelocytes. These cells can release a substance called procoagulant factor Xa, which can lead to widespread clotting and bleeding. The patient's laboratory findings support the diagnosis of APL, with a white blood cell count of 2.4 × 103/µL, a platelet count of 20 × 103/µL, and a prothrombin time of 14.5 seconds. A peripheral blood smear shows the presence of promyelocytes.

The treatment for APL is all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a medication that induces differentiation of promyelocytes into mature myeloid cells. ATRA is often given in combination with chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin. The patient should be referred to a hematologist for further management and treatment.

Title: A Bleeding Oral Mass in a Pregnant Woman Case is: A 24-year-old gravida 1, para 0 woman at 26 weeks’ gestation presented for a routine prenatal visit with a soft-tissue mass on her upper maxillary gingiva. She reported that the mass had been present for 2 to 3 weeks and was increasing in size. It was not painful but bled when she brushed her teeth or ate sharp foods, which made it difficult to eat. There was no discharge from the area. She had no fevers, no trauma to the area, and no history of a similar condition.Vital signs included a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure of 106/57 mm Hg, and heart rate of 93/min. Physical examination revealed a 3 × 5–cm soft, compressible, nodular mass on the upper right gum line adjacent to the lateral incisors (Figure). The mass was friable, pedunculated, and covered with a thin white film. There was some gingival erythema near the adjacent teeth but no lymphadenopathy. The examination results were otherwise unremarkable.What Would You Do Next? A: Prescribe a course of prednisone , B: Perform a needle biopsy , C: Refer to an oral surgeon for excision , D: Recommend watchful waiting. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign tumor of the gums. Pyogenic granulomas are typically caused by inflammation, such as from poor oral hygiene or trauma. They are usually self-limiting, but they can sometimes bleed or become infected.

In this case, the patient is a pregnant woman, which complicates the management of her condition. Some medications, such as prednisone, can be harmful to the fetus during pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to choose a treatment option that is safe for both the mother and the baby.

A needle biopsy is a safe and relatively simple procedure that can be used to diagnose pyogenic granuloma. However, it is not always possible to get a definitive diagnosis from a needle biopsy, and the procedure can sometimes cause bleeding.

Referral to an oral surgeon for excision is another option. Excision is the most definitive way to treat pyogenic granuloma, and it is often the best option for pregnant women. However, surgery carries some risks, such as bleeding and infection.

Watchful waiting is another option, but it is not always appropriate for pregnant women. Pyogenic granulomas can sometimes grow rapidly, and they can bleed or become infected. If the patient is not comfortable with watchful waiting, it is best to choose another treatment option.

Title: A Large Adrenal Tumor With Marked  18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Uptake Case is: A 56-year-old woman was referred for evaluation of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass. She experienced no symptoms of weight loss, headache, sweating, palpitations, pallor, anxiety, menstrual abnormalities, or mood changes; had no known history of cancer or hypertension; and was not taking any medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 135/73 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 82/min. There was no truncal or facial obesity, acne, striae, hirsutism, or proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory analysis showed normal blood cell counts and levels of electrolytes, liver enzymes, and lactate dehydrogenase. Further biochemical evaluation revealed normal levels of plasma and urinary cortisol, serum aldosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and urinary metanephrines. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 5.5 × 4.3–cm left adrenal tumor with heterogeneous appearance, a hypodense central area, and irregular margins, with a density of 36 Hounsfield units (HU). Relative and absolute adrenal washout values (a measure of the disappearance of contrast media from a mass after 10 minutes) were 23% and 47%, respectively. A positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) was performed for further tumor characterization (Figure).Order a repeat CT scan in 3-6 monthsWhat Would You Do Next? A: Perform a biopsy of the mass , B: Order a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months , C: Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy , D: Perform adrenal magnetic resonance imaging. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient is most likely to have an adrenal adenoma. Adrenal adenomas are benign tumors that are often found incidentally on imaging studies. They are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, some adrenal adenomas can produce hormones, such as cortisol or aldosterone, which can cause symptoms. In these cases, treatment may be necessary to control the hormone production.

In the case of this patient, she is asymptomatic and has no evidence of hormone excess. Therefore, the initial management should be to observe the mass with serial imaging. A repeat CT scan in 3-6 months would be appropriate to assess for any changes in the size or appearance of the mass. If the mass remains stable, then no further intervention is necessary. However, if the mass grows or changes in appearance, then further evaluation, such as a biopsy, may be necessary.

Answer:

The correct answer is B. Order a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months.

A biopsy is not necessary in this case because the patient is asymptomatic and there is no evidence of hormone excess. A repeat CT scan in 3-6 months would be appropriate to assess for any changes in the size or appearance of the mass. If the mass remains stable, then no further intervention is necessary. However, if the mass grows or changes in appearance, then further evaluation, such as a biopsy, may be necessary.

One was sent for histopathological examination, and the other was sent for fungal, bacterial, and mycobacterial cultures. A bacterial culture swab was obtained from the tense bulla on his left wrist.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated gonococcemia. Disseminated gonococcemia is a rare but serious infection that occurs when Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea, spreads to the bloodstream. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, chills, rash, joint pain, and meningitis. The rash is typically characterized by small, red spots or blisters that appear on the skin, often in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

The patient's laboratory results are also consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated gonococcemia. The white blood cell count is elevated, and there is an increase in the number of neutrophils. The blood cultures are positive for N. gonorrhoeae.

The patient's skin biopsy shows evidence of vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. This is a common finding in disseminated gonococcemia. The biopsy also shows evidence of gonococcal infection.

The patient's diagnosis is disseminated gonococcemia. The treatment for this condition is intravenous antibiotics. The patient should also be treated for any other underlying conditions, such as HIV infection.

A laboratory work-up, potassium hydroxide scraping, and punch biopsies for histopathologic analysis and fungal, bacterial, and atypical mycobacterial tissue cultures were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it is spread from animals to humans. The most common way to get sporotrichosis is through contact with soil or wood that is contaminated with the fungus. The fungus can enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape.

The initial lesion of sporotrichosis is usually a small, painless nodule at the site of infection. The nodule may then enlarge and become ulcerated. The infection can spread to the lymph nodes, causing them to enlarge and become tender. In some cases, the infection can spread to the bones, joints, or central nervous system.

The diagnosis of sporotrichosis is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and histopathologic examination of tissue samples. The fungus can be grown in culture from tissue samples.

The treatment of sporotrichosis is with antifungal medications, such as itraconazole or fluconazole. The treatment may need to be continued for several months.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is an 18-month-old boy with a history of atopic dermatitis who presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of high fever and rash. The rash began 2 days after completing an 8-day course of clindamycin for sinusitis. On presentation, the child was lethargic and fussy, with a temperature of 38.1°C. Physical examination revealed a strikingly symmetrical eruption of erythematous, edematous, annular plaques with superimposed small pustules at the periphery, and associated desquamation. The eruption was accentuated in the inguinal folds, antecubital fossae, and popliteal fossae. Laboratory evaluation was significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (26000 μL; to convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). Neutrophil levels were 66.7% (to convert to proportion of 1.0, multiply by 0.01), and lymphocyte levels were 9.9% (to convert to proportion of 1.0, multiply by 0.01). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels were within normal limits. Test results for anti-DNase B antibodies, a respiratory viral panel, and blood and throat cultures were all negative.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), pustular psoriasis, deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). AGEP is a rare, self-limited, febrile illness characterized by an eruption of sterile pustules on the trunk and extremities. It typically occurs in children and young adults, and is often associated with recent antibiotic use. Pustular psoriasis is a chronic, recurrent skin disease characterized by the eruption of sterile pustules on the skin. It is most commonly seen in adults, and is associated with a family history of psoriasis. DIRA is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Patients with DIRA are at increased risk for developing severe infections, including skin infections. SSSS is a serious, life-threatening skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by the eruption of large, flaccid bullae that rupture easily, leaving behind denuded skin.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is AGEP. The patient's age, history of recent antibiotic use, and clinical presentation are all consistent with AGEP. The laboratory findings are also consistent with AGEP, as leukocytosis with neutrophilia is a common finding in patients with AGEP. The skin biopsy findings are not diagnostic of any specific disorder, but they are not inconsistent with AGEP.

The treatment for AGEP is supportive care. Patients should be given fluids and electrolytes, and fever should be controlled with antipyretics. In some cases, oral corticosteroids may be necessary. The prognosis for AGEP is generally good, with most patients making a full recovery within a few days to weeks.

Title: A Large Right Shoulder Mass Case is: A 43-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with substernal chest pain and dyspnea. After ruling out acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolus, a computed tomography scan of her thorax revealed lytic lesions of the sternum and second rib and a large mass involving the right scapula (Figure 1). On further inquiry, the patient acknowledged right shoulder pain that had been progressing over 5 months and leading to a limited mobility of the right upper extremity.Cross-sectional computed tomography demonstrating a mass of the right shoulder (arrowhead).Her comorbidities included hypertension, morbid obesity, fibromyalgia, and obstructive sleep apnea dependent on positive pressure ventilation. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 5 years. She smoked for 1 year but quit 20 years before this presentation. There was no family history of malignancy. On examination she was morbidly obese with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 63. There was fullness involving the right scapula. She could not abduct her right arm. Laboratory testing included comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood cell count results within the normal range, except for a calcium level of 10.4 mg/dL (for millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25) (reference range, 8.4-10.2) and alkaline phosphatase level of 400 U/L (for micokatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) (reference range, 36-126). A computed tomography–guided biopsy of the mass gave a broad differential. She was referred to our Cancer Center with a diagnosis of a metastatic giant cell tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was not possible because of weight limitations.What Is Your Diagnosis?

On further inquiry, the patient acknowledged right shoulder pain that had been progressing over 5 months and leading to a limited mobility of the right upper extremity.

The differential diagnosis for a lytic bone lesion includes benign conditions such as giant cell tumor, giant cell reparative granuloma, and brown tumor, as well as malignant conditions such as metastatic disease. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a metastatic lesion. The lytic lesions on the CT scan are also consistent with a metastatic lesion. The patient's elevated calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels are also consistent with a metastatic lesion.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary. The patient should be referred to a cancer center for further evaluation and treatment.

Title: An Uncommon Occupational Lesion Case is: A 35-year-old white head and neck surgeon with an unremarkable medical history was referred to the Surgical Emergency Department for a phlegmon of the flexor tendon sheath of the right hand. The lesion progressively developed several days after an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing. A soft tissue abscess of the digit appeared 7 days after the initial trauma. Antibiotic therapy combining amoxicillin and clavulanate was started, without any significant improvement. Surgery was performed urgently, with excision of the wound entrance and washing of the flexor tendon sheath. Bacteriological swabs were performed in the same time. An antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate was prescribed. Forty-eight hours after surgery, pustules appeared. Further drainage and washing of the sheath were repeated (Figure, A). The bacteriological samples were found to be sterile. The surgeon was hospitalized for infusions combining piperacillin/tazobactam and teicoplanine, carried out over 72 hours. An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. One year later, the surgeon presented with prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed (Figure, B).A, Clinical aspect of the index finger 2 days after the second surgery.

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of recurrent herpetic whitlow. The patient is a 35-year-old white head and neck surgeon with an unremarkable medical history. He was referred to the Surgical Emergency Department for a phlegmon of the flexor tendon sheath of the right hand. The lesion progressively developed several days after an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient presented a deep wound induced by the bistoury piercing of the index finger pulp of the right hand, with a disrupted epidermal barrier. Both the patient who was operated on and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing.

An oral antibiotic regimen with amoxicillin/clavulanate (3 g every 24 hours) was prescribed for 10 additional days. The lesions completely resolved within 2 weeks. One year later, the surgeon presented with prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed (Figure, B).

The most common cause of herpetic whitlow is infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is a common virus that can be transmitted through contact with infected saliva, blood, or other bodily fluids. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Once infected, the virus can remain dormant in the body for years before being reactivated by a trigger, such as stress, illness, or injury.

The typical presentation of herpetic whitlow is a painful, red, and swollen fingertip. The lesion may also be accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise. In some cases, the lesion may rupture and form a crust. The lesions typically resolve within 2-3 weeks, but they can recur in some people.

The diagnosis of herpetic whitlow is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. In some cases, a laboratory test may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of herpetic whitlow is usually with oral antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to drain an abscess.

The prognosis for herpetic whitlow is generally good. Most people make a full recovery without any long-term problems. However, the virus can remain dormant in the body and be reactivated in the future.

Title: Bilateral Decreased Vision During Pregnancy Case is: A pregnant woman in her 30s presented at 20 weeks with a 4-week history of bilateral decreased vision. Her medical history was remarkable for type 2 diabetes (which was well-controlled with insulin), and a review of systems found that she had not experienced headache, pain, or neurologic complaints. Her blood pressure was 102/54, and her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/40 OS without afferent pupillary defect, motility disturbance, or intraocular pressure abnormalities. A fundus examination was remarkable for bilateral hyperemic discs and macular edema and subretinal fluid, with numerous flame-shaped hemorrhages in 4 quadrants without microaneurysms, exudates, or neovascularization (Figure). There was no evidence of intraocular inflammation. Fluorescein angiography was deferred because of her pregnancy.A and B, Fundus photographs demonstrating macular edema, prominent flame hemorrhages, and a mild tortuosity of the retinal venules.

Reasoning:
The patient in this case has bilateral decreased vision during pregnancy. She has a history of type 2 diabetes, and her blood pressure is 102/54. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/50 OD and 20/40 OS without afferent pupillary defect, motility disturbance, or intraocular pressure abnormalities. A fundus examination reveals bilateral hyperemic discs and macular edema and subretinal fluid, with numerous flame-shaped hemorrhages in 4 quadrants without microaneurysms, exudates, or neovascularization. There is no evidence of intraocular inflammation. Fluorescein angiography was deferred because of her pregnancy. A complete blood cell count, antithrombin III, protein C, prothrombin mutation, antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin, diluted Russell viper venom test, and antinuclear antibody testing results were within normal limits. Her protein S level is decreased (61%) and factor V Leiden testing results revealed heterozygosity in the R506Q mutation.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). PDR is a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness. It is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels in the retina, which can cause bleeding and scarring. The risk of developing PDR increases with the duration of diabetes and the degree of blood sugar control.

The treatment for PDR depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, laser therapy may be used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the vitreous gel from the eye.

In this case, the patient is pregnant, which complicates the treatment options. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are a common treatment for PDR, but they are not recommended during pregnancy. The risk of harm to the fetus is unknown.

The best option for this patient is to refer her to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation. Anticoagulation therapy can help to prevent the growth of new blood vessels and reduce the risk of bleeding.

Title: An Expansile Mass of the Sphenoid Sinus or Petrous Apex Case is: A man in his 30s presented with a 1-week history of worsening blurry vision and gait instability. He had been treated approximately 4 months prior at an outside facility for cerebral infarct with resultant right lower extremity weakness. On presentation, he complained of headache and nasal congestion but denied diplopia or rhinorrhea. He had no history of head trauma or surgery. Findings from the ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral visual acuity of 20/100 with intact visual fields. Findings from a head and neck examination were otherwise within normal limits, with cranial nerves III to XII intact. Computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses with image guidance protocol revealed a 5.6 × 2.7 × 2.0-cm, well-circumscribed expansile mass occupying the left petrous apex and sphenoid sinus (Figure, A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated that this mass was heterogeneous on T1-weighted images (Figure, B) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The mass did not enhance with gadolinium. The position of the internal carotid artery was not obviously displaced in either a posterior or anterior direction (Figure, A and B). Therefore, it was not entirely clear from imaging if this lesion originated in the petrous apex or sphenoid sinus. The patient was taken to the operating room in conjunction with the neurosurgery team for an endoscopic, transnasal approach to this lesion. A wide sphenoidotomy was performed, and a cystic mass was identified within the sphenoid sinus (Figure, C). On entering the capsule, a golden-brown fluid was encountered (Figure, D).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Cholesterol granuloma , B: Mucocele , C: Chondrosarcoma , D: Chordoma.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 30s who presented with a 1-week history of worsening blurry vision and gait instability. He had been treated approximately 4 months prior at an outside facility for cerebral infarct with resultant right lower extremity weakness. On presentation, he complained of headache and nasal congestion but denied diplopia or rhinorrhea. He had no history of head trauma or surgery.

A wide sphenoidotomy was performed, and a cystic mass was identified within the sphenoid sinus. On entering the capsule, a golden-brown fluid was encountered.

The differential diagnosis for a well-circumscribed expansile mass of the petrous apex or sphenoid sinus includes cholesterol granuloma, mucocele, chondrosarcoma, and chordoma. Cholesterol granulomas are benign lesions that are thought to arise from inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. They are typically located in the sphenoid sinus and are characterized by a central cholesterol granuloma with a surrounding rim of fibrosis. Mucoceles are benign lesions that are thought to arise from obstruction of a sinus ostium. They are typically located in the frontal sinus and are characterized by a cystic mass filled with mucus. Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from cartilage. They are typically located in the long bones, but can also occur in the head and neck. Chordomas are malignant tumors that arise from notochordal remnants. They are typically located in the sacrum, but can also occur in the skull base.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is cholesterol granuloma. This is based on the patient's history of sinusitis, the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed expansile mass with a central cholesterol granuloma, and the surgical findings of a cystic mass filled with golden-brown fluid.

**Answer:**

A. Cholesterol granuloma

Title: Unilateral Hearing Loss and Otorrhea Case is: A man in his 70s presented with painless left-sided otorrhea, aural fullness, and hearing loss for nearly 1 year. He had previous complaints of left-sided aural pressure and intermittent clear otorrhea that were unsuccessfully treated at another center with 2 sets of pressure equalization tubes (PETs) and 3 courses of ototopical antibiotics. In the month before presenting to us, the otorrhea had turned bloody. He had not experienced fever, malaise, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or vertigo. Pertinent medical history included obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The CLL had been treated successfully with chemotherapy and had been in remission for the past 6 years. The only notable finding from the physical examination was a hypomobile left tympanic membrane with an anterior-inferior PET plugged by granulation tissue. Facial nerve function was normal bilaterally. Audiometry results demonstrated a left moderate sloping to profound mixed hearing loss and speech discrimination score of 68%. A fine-cut, temporal bone computed tomographic (CT) scan was obtained, which demonstrated near-complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells, and middle ear (Figure, A). The patient underwent a left tympanomastoidectomy for continuing otorrhea. Bulky soft tissue was removed from the middle ear and mastoid. Cytopathologic examination revealed numerous, small, basophilic cells (Figure, B).

Cytopathologic examination revealed numerous, small, basophilic cells (Figure, B). Immunostaining showed that the cells were CD20 positive (Figure, C) and CD3 negative (Figure, D).

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) of the temporal bone. LCH is a rare, non-malignant disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. LCH can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the skin, bone, and lymph nodes. In the temporal bone, LCH can cause a variety of symptoms, including otorrhea, aural fullness, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis. The diagnosis of LCH is made based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and biopsy. Treatment for LCH is typically with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of other conditions that can cause otorrhea, aural fullness, and hearing loss. These include chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, and Meniere's disease. However, the patient's history and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the CT scan and biopsy, are most consistent with a diagnosis of LCH.

Title: Frontal Sinus Lesion Case is: A woman in her 50s with a long history of allergic rhinitis was referred for progressive periorbital edema with proptosis of the left eye for the past 2 years, with associated nasal congestion, altered sense of smell, and intermittent left supraorbital pain. There was no associated history of diplopia or worsening visual acuity. She had not experienced facial trauma or sinus surgery. Treatment of allergic rhinitis with cetirizine and intranasal fluticasone had provided only partial relief. On examination, there was proptosis and periorbital edema of the left eye without any restriction of extraocular movements. The left supraorbital area was tender to palpation, with no abnormal masses appreciated. A computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated extensive thickening of the left frontal bone, extending over the entire roof of the orbit posteriorly (Figure, A and B). Changes within the frontal sinus were consistent with a soft-tissue component of the mass. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure, C and D) showed markedly hypertrophic bone in the frontal region and a homogeneously enhancing lesion within the left frontal sinus that was hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with left extraconal superior orbital and left frontal intracranial extension with dural enhancement. A combination above-and-below approach combining unilateral frontal sinusotomy with a trephination was performed. Abnormal tissue appearing in the left frontal sinus was removed, along with diseased tissue that extended into the orbital roof and orbit. Specimens were sent for pathologic evaluation, and findings demonstrated bony spaces containing lobules and whorls of spindle cells.A and B, Preoperative computed tomography (CT).

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her 50s with a long history of allergic rhinitis who presents with progressive periorbital edema with proptosis of the left eye for the past 2 years, with associated nasal congestion, altered sense of smell, and intermittent left supraorbital pain. There is no associated history of diplopia or worsening visual acuity. She has not experienced facial trauma or sinus surgery.

Abnormal tissue appearing in the left frontal sinus was removed, along with diseased tissue that extended into the orbital roof and orbit. Specimens were sent for pathologic evaluation, and findings demonstrated bony spaces containing lobules and whorls of spindle cells.

The most likely diagnosis is fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a non-cancerous (benign) bone disorder that occurs when abnormal fibrous tissue replaces normal bone. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and it can affect any bone in the body, but it is most often seen in the long bones of the arms and legs. The cause of fibrous dysplasia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a genetic mutation.

The symptoms of fibrous dysplasia vary depending on the location of the affected bone. In the case of the patient described above, the fibrous dysplasia was located in the frontal sinus. This caused the patient to experience progressive periorbital edema with proptosis of the left eye, as well as nasal congestion, altered sense of smell, and intermittent left supraorbital pain.

The diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia is made based on a physical examination, imaging studies, and a biopsy. The treatment of fibrous dysplasia depends on the location of the affected bone, the severity of the symptoms, and the patient's age. In some cases, no treatment is necessary. In other cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected bone or to correct any deformities that have developed.

The prognosis for patients with fibrous dysplasia is generally good. Most patients have a normal lifespan and can live active and productive lives. However, there is a risk of complications, such as fractures, pain, and nerve damage.

Title: An Enlarging Neck Mass Case is: A man in his 50s presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided neck swelling, pain, and progressive respiratory distress that started while playing basketball. He reported a 2-day history of left-sided jaw pain preceding the swelling but had no other clinically significant history. Physical examination showed trismus, rightward tracheal deviation, and a hoarse voice. The left side of his neck was diffusely swollen without palpable fluctuance, induration, or a discrete mass. A complete blood cell count revealed no abnormalities. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck showed a large hyperdense mass interposed between the left common carotid artery and the hypopharynx (Figure, A-C). There was resultant lateral deviation of the left common carotid artery and medial deviation on the supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx, resulting in airway compromise. Of note, the density of the mass was identical to that of the adjacent vasculature. There was extensive edema surrounding the primary abnormality. Additional findings include periapical dental abscesses in 2 teeth (Figure, D).What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**
The patient presents with a sudden onset of left-sided neck swelling, pain, and progressive respiratory distress that started while playing basketball. He reported a 2-day history of left-sided jaw pain preceding the swelling but had no other clinically significant history. Physical examination showed trismus, rightward tracheal deviation, and a hoarse voice. The left side of his neck was diffusely swollen without palpable fluctuance, induration, or a discrete mass.

Of note, the density of the mass was identical to that of the adjacent vasculature. There was extensive edema surrounding the primary abnormality. Additional findings include periapical dental abscesses in 2 teeth.

The most likely diagnosis is a pseudoaneurysm. A pseudoaneurysm is a false aneurysm, which is a blood-filled sac that forms when an artery wall ruptures but the surrounding tissue holds the blood in place. Pseudoaneurysms can occur due to trauma, infection, or a weakened artery wall. They are most common in the abdominal aorta, but they can also occur in other arteries, such as the carotid artery in the neck.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. The sudden onset of neck pain and swelling suggests that the pseudoaneurysm has ruptured. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to the mass compressing the airway. The CT scan shows a large, hyperdense mass in the neck that is interposed between the left common carotid artery and the hypopharynx. The mass is of the same density as the adjacent vasculature, which is consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. The extensive edema surrounding the mass is also consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. The periapical dental abscesses are likely unrelated to the pseudoaneurysm.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with a sudden onset of neck pain, swelling, and respiratory distress includes a pseudoaneurysm, a parapharyngeal abscess, a paraganglioma, and a venolymphatic malformation. A pseudoaneurysm is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

**Answer:** A. Pseudoaneurysm

Title: Acute and Painless Monocular Vision Loss in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Man Case is: A man in his 40s presented with central vision loss in his right eye of 1-week duration. There were no associated feelings of pain, flashes, or floaters. A review of his systems was significant for bilateral lower leg swelling, a rash of the torso, painful “bumps” on his neck, reduced hearing abilities, and tinnitus.His medical history was significant for human immunodeficiency virus, controlled with antiretroviral therapy (Strilbild; Gilead Sciences Inc). His cluster of differentiation 4 count was 600, and his viral load was undetectable. His ocular history was unremarkable. He was homosexual, did not smoke, and denied intravenous drug use.His best-corrected visual acuity was hand motion OD and 20/20 OS. No afferent pupillary defect was apparent. His intraocular pressures were 19 mm Hg in OU. His external and anterior segment examinations were within normal limits. There was 1+ vitritis in the right eye. Figure 1A shows the findings of the posterior segment examination of the right eye. The posterior segment of the left eye was unremarkable. A physical examination revealed a tender lymphadenopathy of the posterior neck and a maculopapular rash of the torso. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Right eye optical coherence tomography was performed (Figure 1B).A, A fundus photograph illustrates a yellowish placoid lesion.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR). AZOOR is a rare, idiopathic, inflammatory disorder of the retinal pigment epithelium that is most commonly seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The most common presentation is acute, painless vision loss in one eye. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical findings, including a characteristic fundus appearance and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings. There is no specific treatment for AZOOR, but most patients experience spontaneous resolution of vision loss over time. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids may be used to treat inflammation.

Answer: C. Serologic testing for HIV, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and CMV is indicated in all patients with AZOOR. These tests can help to identify any underlying infections that may be contributing to the patient's condition. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is not routinely indicated in patients with AZOOR, but it may be helpful in patients with suspected central nervous system involvement. Chorioretinal biopsy is rarely necessary to make the diagnosis of AZOOR, but it may be helpful in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain.

Title: Bilateral Retinal Whitening in a Hospitalized Patient Case is: A 35-year-old man was admitted as an inpatient for altered mental status and experienced acute-onset bilateral decreased vision on the second day of hospitalization. He denied any medication use and had no previous history of ocular surgery or known ophthalmic disorders.On examination, visual acuity with correction was 20/400 OD and 20/100 OS. Intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Both pupils were briskly reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. Slitlamp examination was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination of both eyes revealed peripapillary retinal whitening emanating from the optic nerve and encroaching into the macula, more pronounced in the right eye (Figure 1A). Late-phase frames of fluorescein angiogram in both eyes revealed hypofluorescence corresponding to the areas of retinal whitening and obscuring the choroidal fluorescence in these areas, along with nasal peripapillary hyperfluorescence in the areas of retinal whitening (Figure 1B).Fundus photograph (A) and late-phase frame fluorescein angiography (B) of the right eye.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
The correct answer is: D. Gene sequencing is needed to identify the exact mutation and prognosticate.

Reasoning:

The patient has been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) complicated by leukostasis. Bone marrow karyotyping revealed a normal karyotype; 46 XX [20]. Multigene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the bone marrow identified a 44–base pair (bp) internal tandem duplication in the FLT3 gene (OMIM 136351), with an allelic ratio of 0.57 (range, 0.01 to >100). No other mutations on the panel (CEBPA, NPM1, KIT, IDH1, and IDH2) were detected.

FLT3 mutations are common in AML, and they are associated with a worse prognosis. The length of the duplication is not known to affect prognosis. The mutation burden is also not known to affect prognosis.

In order to better prognosticate the patient's outcome, it is necessary to identify the exact FLT3 mutation. This can be done by performing gene sequencing. Gene sequencing will also allow for identification of other mutations that may be present, which could affect prognosis.

Title: A Man With a Nonblanchable Purpuric Rash Case is: A 71-year-old man presented with 4 weeks of a diffuse rash along with 1 week of bilateral elbow and knee pain. For the past year, he had recurrent episodes of diverticulitis complicated by colovesical fistula. Six weeks ago, he underwent sigmoid colon resection with fistula repair. He had no fever, abdominal pain, dysuria, or urinary frequency. He was prescribed prednisone when the rash first presented (starting at 30 mg/d and decreased by 10 mg every 4 days). The rash improved initially but recurred at the 10-mg/d prednisone dosing. Medical history included glaucoma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and osteoarthritis. His home medications included lansoprazole, probiotics, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin D3, prednisone (10 mg/d), and timolol eye gel. He had no sick contacts or recent travel and reported no alcohol or tobacco use.On examination, the patient was afebrile and normotensive, with a pulse of 88/min. He had an erythematous rash, characterized by a combination of palpable purpura and petechiae extending from the axilla to the lower abdomen, back, and lower extremities (Figure 1A). The face, neck, chest, upper extremities, and oral and nasal mucosa were spared. The abdomen was nontender, with a healed postoperative scar. Cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal examination results were unremarkable.Left, Cutaneous findings on physical examination. Right, Punch biopsy of rash on lower abdomen (hematoxylin-eosin, ×200).Laboratory tests revealed normal blood cell counts and normal values for renal and hepatic panels. Urinalysis showed microscopic hematuria (6-10 red blood cells) and 1+ proteinuria. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on morning void was 1.17 mg/mg creatinine. A punch biopsy of the rash on the lower abdomen was performed (Figure 1B).Check serologies for hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, and streptococcal infectionsPerform direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsyPrescribe steroids with a slow and prolonged tapering regimenWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a nonblanchable purpuric rash, which is a sign of vasculitis. Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and drug reactions. The patient's history of diverticulitis and colovesical fistula suggests that he may have an underlying autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and other organs. The patient's rash is consistent with a diagnosis of SLE, and the laboratory tests that were ordered are appropriate to screen for SLE. However, the punch biopsy of the rash is the most definitive test for SLE. If the biopsy shows evidence of vasculitis, the patient will need to be treated with immunosuppressive medications.

Title: JAK2  V617F Mutation Testing in Patients Presenting With Hepatic and Portal Vein Thrombosis Case is: A 27-year-old woman with asthma and obesity recently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed cholecystitis. One week later, she had new-onset ascites and diffuse abdominal pain. She was a current smoker, was taking oral contraceptives, and delivered a healthy infant (2.5 months prior). The patient was not jaundiced, but her abdomen was distended without rebound or guarding. An ultrasound of her right upper quadrant showed hepatic vein thrombosis that was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. A laboratory workup and bone marrow biopsy were performed (Table).How Would You Interpret These Test Results? A: The patient has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). , B: The patient has paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. , C: The patient has hereditary protein C deficiency. , D: The patient has hereditary antithrombin III deficiency.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 27-year-old woman with asthma and obesity who recently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed cholecystitis. One week later, she had new-onset ascites and diffuse abdominal pain. She was a current smoker, was taking oral contraceptives, and delivered a healthy infant (2.5 months prior). The patient was not jaundiced, but her abdomen was distended without rebound or guarding. An ultrasound of her right upper quadrant showed hepatic vein thrombosis that was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. A laboratory workup and bone marrow biopsy were performed.

The patient's laboratory workup showed an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Her bone marrow biopsy showed a hypercellular marrow with increased myeloid precursors. The patient was found to have a JAK2 V617F mutation.

JAK2 V617F is a mutation that occurs in the JAK2 gene. This gene codes for a protein that is involved in the regulation of blood cell production. The JAK2 V617F mutation causes the JAK2 protein to become overactive, which can lead to the production of too many blood cells. This can lead to a condition called myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

MPNs are a group of blood cancers that are characterized by the uncontrolled production of blood cells. MPNs can be life-threatening, but there are treatments available that can help to control the disease.

In the patient's case, the JAK2 V617F mutation was found in the setting of hepatic vein thrombosis. Hepatic vein thrombosis is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the hepatic vein. This can lead to liver damage and failure.

Hepatic vein thrombosis is a known complication of MPNs. The JAK2 V617F mutation is a risk factor for hepatic vein thrombosis.

The patient's history, physical examination, laboratory workup, and bone marrow biopsy findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of MPN. The JAK2 V617F mutation is a strong predictor of MPN.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is MPN.

Title: Annular Plaques With Skin Atrophy in a Young Patient Case is: A young woman presented with multiple arciform to annular plaques on her extremities, favoring the antecubital and popliteal fossae (Figure, A). The patient reported that these asymptomatic lesions had been present since her adolescence, and she was easily bruised with minimal trauma since birth. There was no family history of similar cutaneous findings.Clinically, arciform to annular plaques surround white atrophic patches on the left antecubital fossa (A), and skin atrophy is apparent on the dorsal aspects of the hands (B). C, Histopathologically, a punch biopsy specimen from a papule on the left arm was analyzed with Verhoeff–van Gieson stain (original magnification ×100).On close inspection, the plaques were found to be composed of individual 2- to 4-mm keratotic papules surrounding white atrophic patches. Physical examination also revealed remarkable skin atrophy on the dorsal aspects of her hands (Figure, B) and feet. The patient’s skin was generally pale and translucent with visible veins, especially on the chest and abdomen. The face appeared to be emaciated, with a pinched nose, thin lips, sunken cheeks, and prominent eyes. A punch biopsy specimen from an individual papule from the left arm was obtained and analyzed under Verhoeff–van Gieson stain (Figure, C).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning: The patient in the case has multiple arciform to annular plaques on her extremities, favoring the antecubital and popliteal fossae. The plaques are asymptomatic and have been present since her adolescence. The patient also has a history of easy bruising since birth. On physical examination, she has remarkable skin atrophy on the dorsal aspects of her hands and feet. Her skin is generally pale and translucent with visible veins. The face appears to be emaciated, with a pinched nose, thin lips, sunken cheeks, and prominent eyes. A punch biopsy specimen from an individual papule from the left arm was obtained and analyzed under Verhoeff–van Gieson stain, which showed fragmentation of elastic fibers.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma, granuloma annulare, porokeratosis, and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa. Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is a rare, benign, inflammatory condition that typically presents as solitary or multiple annular plaques on the extremities. Granuloma annulare is a common, self-limited, inflammatory condition that typically presents as small, asymptomatic papules or plaques on the hands, feet, and lower legs. Porokeratosis is a rare, chronic, non-inflammatory condition that typically presents as solitary or multiple hyperkeratotic papules or plaques on the sun-exposed skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue that is characterized by skin fragility, easy bruising, and widespread elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa. This is based on the patient's history of multiple arciform to annular plaques on her extremities, her history of easy bruising since birth, and the findings on physical examination, including her remarkable skin atrophy and the presence of visible veins on her chest and abdomen. The punch biopsy specimen from an individual papule from the left arm also showed fragmentation of elastic fibers, which is a characteristic finding in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

Title: Progressive Purpura in a Long-term Care Patient Case is: A man in his 80s presented with a 1-year history of purpura, ecchymoses, anorexia, and weight loss. His medical history included alcohol abuse and cognitive impairment. Purpura and ecchymoses, initially periorbital, progressed over the previous 12 months. Elder abuse was excluded. Examination demonstrated waxy yellow papules and plaques with purpura in the periocular, neck, axillary, trunk, and inguinal regions (Figure, A). Investigations revealed anemia, abnormal liver function test results, and renal impairment with moderate proteinuria. The patient’s serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis test results were normal. Radiological studies were unremarkable. Subsequently, a 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, B-D).A, Waxy yellow discoloration of the skin with papules and purpura in the periorbital region. B, Punch biopsy specimen (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification × 4). C, Punch biopsy specimen stained with Congo red (original magnification × 10).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of alcohol abuse and cognitive impairment. He presents with a 1-year history of purpura, ecchymoses, anorexia, and weight loss. On examination, he has waxy yellow papules and plaques with purpura in the periocular, neck, axillary, trunk, and inguinal regions. Investigations reveal anemia, abnormal liver function test results, and renal impairment with moderate proteinuria. The patient’s serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis test results are normal. Radiological studies are unremarkable. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen is obtained, which shows amyloid deposits on Congo red staining.

The most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid, a protein that forms abnormal fibrils, in various organs and tissues. The most common type of amyloidosis is AL amyloidosis, which is caused by the deposition of immunoglobulin light chains. AL amyloidosis can present with a variety of symptoms, including purpura, ecchymoses, anorexia, and weight loss. On examination, patients with AL amyloidosis may have waxy yellow papules and plaques with purpura in the periocular, neck, axillary, trunk, and inguinal regions. Investigations may reveal anemia, abnormal liver function test results, and renal impairment with moderate proteinuria. The patient’s serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis test results are usually normal. Radiological studies are often unremarkable. A diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is made by biopsy of an affected organ, which shows amyloid deposits on Congo red staining.

The treatment of AL amyloidosis is based on the underlying cause. If the amyloidosis is caused by a monoclonal gammopathy, such as multiple myeloma, then treatment with chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation may be indicated. If the amyloidosis is not caused by a monoclonal gammopathy, then treatment with melphalan and prednisone may be indicated. In some cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Title: Multiple Spinal Lesions in an Immunocompetent Young Man Case is: A 30-year-old man was referred with progressive quadriplegia for 2 months. The muscle weakness started from the right lower limb and gradually spread to the upper limb and contralateral side. Urinary retention developed 1 month later. Because he was suspected of having tubercular meningomyelitis, he received an antituberculosis regimen plus dexamethasone (10 mg daily) for 10 days. The symptoms ameliorated in the first week but thereafter deteriorated with fever. He had no history of central nervous system injury or drug overuse. He was a construction supervisor and had daily contact with moist earth. No relevant family history was reported. On physical examination, he was alert and well oriented. The cranial nerve was intact, but he had quadriplegia with a Medical Research Council muscle scale grade of 0 of 5 power, decreased tendon reflexes, and bilateral positive Babinski sign. Pinprick and vibration sensation were markedly impaired below the nipples. Multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes could be palpitated. The skin was extraordinarily dry, and a pigmentation of 10 mm in diameter at the T2 vertebrae, just on the midline of the back, was noticed. Total blood T-cell count (CD3+) was 1643/uL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), and the patient had a CD4+/CD8+ ratio of 0.89. Results of blood testing for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and tuberculosis were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid testing revealed pleocytosis (72 cells/uL; mononuclear cells, 59 of 72), elevated protein concentration (200 mg/dL), and a decreased glucose level (36.0 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]), but no organisms were identified on Gram stain or on stain for acid-fast bacilli.

What Is Your Diagnosis?

A: Tubercular meningomyelitis
B: Mycotic meningomyelitis
C: Neurosarcoidosis
D: Central nervous system lymphoma

Reasoning:

The patient has a progressive quadriplegia with a sensory level at the T2 level. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows a pleocytosis with a predominance of mononuclear cells, an elevated protein concentration, and a decreased glucose level. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine shows multiple intramedullary lesions with enhancement. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis.

Neurosarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect any organ system, including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is involved in approximately 5% of cases of sarcoidosis. The most common CNS manifestations of sarcoidosis are cranial neuropathies, seizures, and hydrocephalus. Myelitis is a less common manifestation of sarcoidosis, but it can occur in up to 10% of cases.

The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is made based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The CSF findings in neurosarcoidosis are non-specific and can be seen in other inflammatory disorders of the CNS. The MRI findings in neurosarcoidosis are characteristic and can be used to support the diagnosis.

The treatment of neurosarcoidosis is with corticosteroids. Other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, may be used in patients who do not respond to corticosteroids. The prognosis for neurosarcoidosis is variable, but with treatment, most patients have a good outcome.

**Reasoning:**
The patient presents with a history of recurrent painless tongue masses since birth. The lesions are usually white and the size of a pinhead, and located on the anterior portion of the tongue. Occasionally they would grow in size and progress to red-filled vesicles that did not burst or bleed. The timing of the lesions was not associated with fever or other rashes. The patient’s history is otherwise unremarkable, he had no recent travel outside the United States, and his vaccinations were up to date. On physical examination, the patient had multiple pale, nontender papules distributed over the anterior third of his tongue. No other masses were noted to the remainder of his oropharynx. He was afebrile and had no signs or symptoms of airway obstruction.

The most likely diagnosis is **oral lymphangioma**. Oral lymphangiomas are benign vascular malformations that are composed of dilated lymphatic channels. They can occur anywhere in the oral cavity, but are most common on the tongue. Oral lymphangiomas can be classified as simple or cavernous. Simple lymphangiomas are small, superficial lesions that are usually asymptomatic. Cavernous lymphangiomas are larger, deeper lesions that can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing.

The diagnosis of oral lymphangioma is usually made based on the history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the lesion.

There is no cure for oral lymphangioma, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include surgery, laser therapy, and sclerotherapy. Surgery is the most common treatment for oral lymphangioma. Laser therapy and sclerotherapy are less invasive options that may be used to treat small lesions.

The prognosis for oral lymphangioma is generally good. Most lesions are small and asymptomatic, and they do not require treatment. However, larger lesions can cause significant problems, such as pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing. In these cases, treatment may be necessary to improve the patient's quality of life.

At physical examination the patient was pale, sweaty, peripherally hypoperfused, tachypnoeic, and dehydrated, and the abdomen was extremely distended, diffusely tympanic, and tender at palpation. His blood pressure was 90/70 mm Hg, his heart rate was 114 beats per minute, his oxygen saturation was at 90%, his arterial blood gas pH level was 7.43, his partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 32, his partial pressure of oxygen 68, his laceration lactate level was 5.0, and his white blood cell count was 24 000 mm3. A plain abdominal radiograph showed a huge colonic distension (Figure 1A). A computed tomography scan with multiplanar reconstruction was also performed (Figure 1B).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is cecal volvulus. Cecal volvulus is a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the cecum, the lower right portion of the large intestine, twists on itself. This can cause a blockage of the bowel and lead to abdominal distension, pain, and vomiting.

The coffee-bean sign is a classic finding on plain abdominal radiographs in patients with cecal volvulus. It is caused by the twisting of the cecum and the accumulation of gas and fluid in the distended bowel.

A computed tomography scan with multiplanar reconstruction can provide additional information about the location and extent of the cecal volvulus. It can also help to rule out other causes of bowel obstruction, such as a tumor or a hernia.

Title: Small-Bowel Obstruction in a 45-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department on the morning after Thanksgiving with sudden, severe, constant epigastric pain that migrated to the right upper quadrant as well as subjective fever and emesis since the previous evening. She reported a failure to pass stool or flatus since the onset of symptoms. She denied hematochezia, melena, or hematemesis. Her medical history was significant for heavy smoking, reflux, and surgical procedures including a right inguinal hernia repair, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, all more than 5 years prior. On examination, she had a distended and tympanic abdomen with tenderness, guarding, and rebound in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant. Vital signs and standard laboratory test results were unremarkable.An upright abdominal plain radiograph showed a distended, thickened stomach and multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a focal area of mixed fat density involving the distal small bowel concerning for a lead point with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding (Figure 1). The scan also revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules.Computed tomography of abdomen. A, Coronal view demonstrating obstructing intraluminal lesion (arrowhead).

Reasoning: The patient's history of heavy smoking, reflux, and surgical procedures including a right inguinal hernia repair, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, all more than 5 years prior, puts her at increased risk for small-bowel obstruction. The patient's presentation with sudden, severe, constant epigastric pain that migrated to the right upper quadrant as well as subjective fever and emesis since the previous evening is consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The patient's failure to pass stool or flatus since the onset of symptoms is also consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The patient's physical examination findings of a distended and tympanic abdomen with tenderness, guarding, and rebound in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant are also consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The upright abdominal plain radiograph showed a distended, thickened stomach and multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, which is also consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a focal area of mixed fat density involving the distal small bowel concerning for a lead point with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding, which is highly suggestive of a small-bowel obstruction. The scan also revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules, which are concerning for metastatic lung cancer. However, the patient's presentation and imaging findings are more consistent with a small-bowel obstruction than with metastatic lung cancer. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is small-bowel obstruction.

Cardiac catheterization of the left side of the heart was performed and showed retrograde filling of the right coronary artery emptying into the main pulmonary artery. Results of a regadenoson-stress myocardial positron emission tomographic perfusion test with ammonia labeled with nitrogen N 13 demonstrated a medium-sized area of moderate stress-induced ischemia throughout the right coronary artery (RCA) territory, with preserved perfusion in the left anterior descending and left circumflex territories.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. The electrocardiogram and Holter monitor results show evidence of ventricular ectopy, and the stress test results show evidence of ischemia in the RCA territory. The cardiac catheterization results show that the RCA is occluded.

The patient's treatment options include medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or surgery. Medical therapy can include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmic drugs. PCI is a procedure that involves inserting a balloon into the blocked artery and inflating it to open the artery. Surgery is a procedure that involves bypass grafting of the blocked artery.

The best treatment option for this patient is PCI. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that is associated with a low risk of complications. It is also a very effective procedure, and it can often resolve the patient's symptoms and improve their quality of life.

Title: Low-Density Lipoprotein Measurement Discordance:  When 2 Wrongs Lead to the Right Answer—Elevated Lipoprotein (a) Case is: A 47-year-old African American man with a medical history significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and gastroesophageal reflux disease was given atorvastatin at 40 mg daily for a markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) of 279 mg/dL (millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). He was subsequently tried on various statins, but owing to hip pain thought possibly because of these agents, a rise in liver enzymes, and persistently elevated LDL-C, he was referred to the Boston Medical Center Lipid Clinic Fasting lipid profile in December 2013 on no lipid-lowering agents included an LDL-C level of 232 mg/dL. He restarted atorvastatin at 40 mg daily because it was determined that his hip pain was more likely because of arthritis than statin therapy. The adherence and effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy were then routinely monitored by measuring direct LDL-C levels, which dropped to 113 mg/dL in June 2014 and 115 mg/dL in October 2015, respectively. Interestingly, his directly measured LDL was 115 mg/dL in October 2015, but a calculated LDL-C was 170 mg/dL in December 2015. Repeat fasting lipid profiles with simultaneously calculated and directly measured LDL-C levels, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) were subsequently assessed in April 2016 and June 2016. They confirmed a marked difference between the direct LDL-C level and calculated LDL-C levels (Table).The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of a laboratory error.The patient has familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia).The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of excess VLDL cholesterol only.How Do You Interpret These Test Results? A: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of a laboratory error. , B: The patient has familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia). , C: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a). , D: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of excess VLDL cholesterol only.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The direct LDL-C level is measured using a chemical assay, while the calculated LDL-C level is estimated using a formula that takes into account the total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides levels. The formula is based on the assumption that the VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a) levels are relatively constant. However, in this case, the patient has familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia), a genetic disorder that causes elevated levels of VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a). This results in a marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL-C levels.

Answer:
C. The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).

Title: Slow-Growing Infiltrative Sinonasal Mass Case is: A man in his 50s was referred for a 6-month history of swelling involving the nasal bridge and right eye, accompanied by intermittent ipsilateral epistaxis. His medical history was notable for allergic rhinitis and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prior biopsy diagnosis from the area of swelling was inflammatory nasal polyp. Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation over the right nasal bridge and mild right proptosis. Flexible and rigid nasal endoscopy demonstrated a right-sided exophytic mass visible between the middle turbinate and nasal septum. Computed tomography showed a large, right-sided mass centered in the ethmoid sinus with expansion into the anterior skull base, anterior cribriform plate, and right medial orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging showed vascularity in the lesion and early intracranial involvement with transdural spread but no evidence of invasion into the meninges or brain. The patient was taken for surgery, and findings from intraoperative frozen section analysis were consistent with a spindle cell neoplasm. Definitive skull base resection of the mass was deferred until final pathological diagnosis was obtained, given the morbidity with skull base resection. The final pathology report showed an infiltrative, low-grade, malignant spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for BCL2 protein and neural marker, S-100 protein, and focal immunoreactivity for smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35 (Figure). Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for β-catenin was noted, and nonreactive immunostains included CD31, CD34, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD99.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathological features, the most likely diagnosis is a low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNSTs are rare, malignant tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They typically present as painless, slowly growing masses in the extremities, but they can also occur in other locations, such as the head and neck. MPNSTs are classified as either low-grade or high-grade tumors. Low-grade MPNSTs are typically slow-growing and have a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 80% to 90%. High-grade MPNSTs are more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 30% to 40%.

The diagnosis of MPNST is made based on a combination of clinical, imaging, and pathological features. On imaging, MPNSTs typically appear as lobulated, soft tissue masses with heterogeneous enhancement. Pathologically, MPNSTs are characterized by the presence of spindle cells with nuclear atypia and mitotic figures. Immunohistochemical staining can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to further classify the tumor. MPNSTs typically express S-100 protein, which is a marker of Schwann cells. They may also express other markers, such as BCL2 protein and CD34.

The treatment of MPNST is based on the stage of the tumor. Low-grade MPNSTs can be treated with surgery alone, with or without radiation therapy. High-grade MPNSTs are typically treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with MPNST depends on the stage of the tumor and the type of treatment received. Patients with low-grade MPNSTs typically have a good prognosis, while patients with high-grade MPNSTs have a poorer prognosis.

She presents with mild to moderate trismus and swelling on the left side of the face of a few months’ duration. Her physical examination is remarkable for left-sided facial swelling. No deficits of the facial or trigeminal nerves are detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a mass lying on the anterior surface of the eroded left mandibular condyle with homogeneous isointensity relative to skeletal muscle. The mass enhances homogeneously and avidly on postcontrast T1-weighted imaging with fat suppression. The mass is also moderately hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and shows marked diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is the most common primary bone cancer in adults. Osteosarcoma is characterized by the formation of osteoid and bone by malignant osteoblasts. The tumor can occur anywhere in the skeleton, but it is most common in the long bones of the arms and legs. The most common presenting symptoms of osteosarcoma are pain, swelling, and a mass in the affected area. Osteosarcoma is often diagnosed with imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI. Treatment for osteosarcoma typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for osteosarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease and the patient's age and overall health. However, with modern treatment, many patients with osteosarcoma can survive for many years.

Title: Slowly Enlarging Neck Mass Case is: A white man in his 40s presented with a slowly enlarging, nontender, left-sided neck mass at the angle of the mandible that had been present for 4 years. Fine-needle aspiration was performed twice, each time with inconclusive results. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed a heterogeneous mass located immediately adjacent to the tail of the left parotid. No other masses were noted. He underwent a left superficial parotidectomy with en bloc removal of the mass. Pathologic findings revealed a 3.0 × 2.9 × 1.9-cm, encapsulated, tan, soft nodule within the specimen. The nodule had peripheral cystic spaces as well as focal areas of hemorrhage and a 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.4-cm area of calcification within the periphery. The entire tumor was confined within a periparotid lymph node, almost completely replacing it. Histopathologic findings (Figure) showed a mixture of dark, granular, basophilic acinar cells and eosinophilic intercalated ductal cells. The acinar cells contained periodic acid–Schiff–positive, diastase-resistant intracytoplasmic granules, whereas the ductal cells were both fusiform and cuboidal forming small ductlike structures. The neoplasm also exhibited focal areas of hyaline sclerosis without necrosis.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: A Young Man With Proptosis Causing Decreased Visual Acuity Case is: A teenage boy was referred with a progressive 2-week history of blurred vision in his right eye and right ear pain, which had worsened in the past 7 days. This change prompted a visit to an optometrist, who found a mild decrease in visual acuity and minor cataract in the right eye. His primary care physician diagnosed his ear pain as acute otitis media and prescribed a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, the young man’s vision continued to deteriorate and became associated with the onset of right eye swelling and forehead tenderness. A repeat eye examination by an ophthalmologist was performed and showed normal peripheral visual acuity with a decrease in central vision and confirmed proptosis. The patient had not experienced nasal congestion, epistaxis, weight loss, fevers, or chills. Physical examination included right eye proptosis and restricted eye movement. A computed tomographic (CT) scan with contrast of the face showed a small relatively homogenous mass in the right anterior nasal cavity invading the right orbit, and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) with contrast showed a right superior nasal cavity mass, with invasion of the right orbit and right ethmoidal sinus with extension to the overlying soft-tissue scalp (Figure).

It is the most common primary malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Esthesioneuroblastoma typically presents in young adults with a history of nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and anosmia. Physical examination may reveal proptosis, facial asymmetry, and ecchymosis of the eyelids. Imaging studies typically show a mass in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses with invasion of the orbit. The diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma is made by biopsy. Treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for esthesioneuroblastoma is variable, but the overall 5-year survival rate is approximately 70%.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a young woman with a 2-month history of frequent headaches and 1 week of blurry vision in her left eye. She has no significant past medical history. Her ocular history is significant only for refractive error. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and fluoxetine. On review of systems, she endorses nausea as well as paresthesia in her hands.

Neuro-ophthalmic examination reveals visual acuities of 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS, with no pinhole improvement. Color vision (Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates) is within normal limits bilaterally, although it was noted to be slightly slower in the left eye.

Automated (Humphrey) visual field testing revealed enlargement of the blind spot in the right eye (mean deviation, −2.91 dB) and generalized, nonspecific depression in the left eye (mean deviation, −3.41 dB). Examination of her fundus was notable for bilateral optic disc swelling (Frisén grade 2 in each eye) as well as unilateral macular exudates, subretinal fluid, and subretinal hemorrhages in the left eye. Results from brain magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance venography with and without contrast were normal.

The differential diagnosis for a young woman with optic disc swelling includes optic neuritis, papilledema, and pseudotumor cerebri. Optic neuritis is a demyelinating disease of the optic nerve that typically presents with sudden onset of visual loss, pain with eye movements, and optic disc swelling. Papilledema is a non-inflammatory swelling of the optic disc that is caused by increased intracranial pressure. Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition of unknown cause that is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a mass lesion.

The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with papilledema. The optic disc swelling is bilateral, and there is no evidence of optic nerve inflammation. The patient's headaches are likely secondary to increased intracranial pressure. The brain magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance venography with and without contrast is normal, which makes a mass lesion unlikely.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis. The lumbar puncture will help to determine the intracranial pressure and to rule out a mass lesion. The routine chemistry and cell count analysis will help to rule out infection or inflammation.

On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD with correction, and the superior cornea showed an intact epithelium, mild stromal thinning, and pannus with faint yellow-white subepithelial deposits at the leading edge (Figure 1A). There were no other abnormalities reported on examination. The patient was treated conservatively with lubrication. Slitlamp photographs of corneal findings. A, Appearance of the cornea at time of the initial presentation. B, Appearance of the cornea 1 year later, with more prominent neovascularization and progression of deposits toward the visual axis.A year later, best-corrected visual acuity had decreased to 20/30 OD with against-the-rule astigmatism. There was progressive corneal thinning and a dense, serpentine network of subepithelial deposits with adjacent neovascularization in the superior cornea, extending toward the visual axis (Figure 1B).Subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medicationRefraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fittingWhat Would You Do Next? A: Crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty , B: Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion , C: Subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication , D: Refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Terrien marginal degeneration, a rare, bilateral, non-inflammatory, degenerative disorder of the peripheral cornea. The disease is characterized by subepithelial deposits, corneal thinning, and neovascularization. The etiology of Terrien marginal degeneration is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for Terrien marginal degeneration, but treatment is aimed at slowing the progression of the disease and improving vision. Treatment options include lubrication, topical steroids, and surgery.

Answer:
The correct answer is **A: Crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty**.

Crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves removing a crescent-shaped piece of tissue from the peripheral cornea. This procedure is effective in treating Terrien marginal degeneration by removing the diseased tissue and restoring the cornea's transparency.

Refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting is not a treatment option for Terrien marginal degeneration. Rigid gas permeable contact lenses can be used to improve vision in patients with Terrien marginal degeneration, but they do not treat the underlying disease.

Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion is an important part of the evaluation of any patient with a corneal disorder. However, it is not a treatment option for Terrien marginal degeneration.

Subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication is not a treatment option for Terrien marginal degeneration. Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medications are used to treat retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. They are not effective in treating Terrien marginal degeneration.

Title: Bilateral Ocular Pain and Hyperemia in a Patient With Paget Disease of the Bone Case is: A man in his early 60s received his initial zoledronic acid (Aclasta, Novartis, Sydney) intravenous infusion (5 mg in 100 mL of solution) for the management of biochemically and radiologically diagnosed Paget disease of the bone. Within 24 hours he developed prodromal flu like myalgias and malaise. After 48 hours, the patient experienced severe bilateral photophobia, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, and blurred vision. His photophobia peaked at 72 hours but had significantly improved by the time of his initial ophthalmic review 4 days after the infusion. His uncorrected visual acuities were 6/5 bilaterally. His intraocular pressures were within normal limits. An anterior segment examination demonstrated symmetric bilateral nasal sectoral subconjunctival hemorrhages (Figure). The corneas were clear. Examination of his anterior chambers revealed a 2+ cell count and 2+ flare count in both eyes without hypopyon or synechiae. The posterior segment was unremarkable, with no evidence of vitritis, retinitis, or macular edema.Routine investigations returned results of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (230 U/L) and mild-positive (1:160) antinuclear antibody speckled pattern. The complete blood cell count and coagulation profile were normal. The results for extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, antidouble-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, rheumatoid factor, human leukocyte antigen B27, QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Quest Diagnostics), syphilis serology, elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level, and a chest radiography were all negative. Topical dexamethasone, 0.1%, and homatropine, 2%, were commenced, with complete resolution of uveitic signs within 2 weeks. Dexamethasone frequency was initially once hourly for 3 days and was followed by a standard weekly tapering course. The homatropine frequency was twice daily.Advise the patient’s endocrinologist to request an alternative to a bisphosphonateRechallenge the patient in 12 months with zoledronic acid and manage reactively if uveitis recursPreemptively treat the patient before his next dose of zoledronic acidTreat the problem as an unrelated idiopathic uveitisWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presented with bilateral ocular pain and hyperemia after receiving zoledronic acid for the management of Paget disease of the bone. The symptoms resolved after treatment with topical steroids, but the patient is at risk of recurrence.

Recommendation:
I would advise the patient's endocrinologist to request an alternative to a bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs that are used to treat Paget disease of the bone. They work by slowing down the breakdown of bone. However, bisphosphonates can also cause uveitis, an inflammation of the eye.

Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate that is commonly used to treat Paget disease of the bone. It is given as an intravenous infusion. The patient in this case developed uveitis after receiving zoledronic acid. The uveitis resolved after treatment with topical steroids, but the patient is at risk of recurrence.

I would advise the patient's endocrinologist to request an alternative to a bisphosphonate. There are other drugs that can be used to treat Paget disease of the bone. These drugs do not have the same risk of causing uveitis.

Title: A 64-Year-Old Man With Swollen, Blistered Eyelids Case is: A 64-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease fell 3 days prior to presentation, hitting the right side of his face, sustaining a small eyelid skin laceration for which he did not seek treatment. Over subsequent days, he developed right periorbital erythema, edema, and pain, with blisters appearing on the eyelid skin 1 day prior to presentation.On examination, his pulse was 120 beats per minute, blood pressure was 92/62 mm Hg, and temperature was 38.2°C. The right upper and lower eyelids were warm, erythematous, edematous, and tender, with large fluctuant blisters (Figure, A). Erythema tracked down the cheek, and there was right cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient did not cooperate for a visual acuity assessment, but there was no afferent pupillary defect. Limited penlight examination revealed a normal anterior segment except for 360° conjunctival chemosis. Noncontrast computed tomography of the orbits demonstrated extensive right preseptal soft tissue swelling and slight enlargement of the right lateral rectus muscle with minimal orbital fat stranding. The right globe was slightly proptotic (Figure, B). Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 32.6 K/µL (to convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), with 95% polymorphonuclear lymphocytes.A, External photograph of the right eyelids demonstrates significant erythema and edema with large blisters. B, Noncontrast axial computed tomography scan of the orbits demonstrates slight proptosis of the right globe, marked preseptal edema on the right, and slight enlargement of the right lateral rectus muscle.Begin oral antibiotics and discharge home with follow-up the next dayPerform bedside incision and drainage of the blisters and admit for intravenous antibioticsPerform aggressive debridement of the eyelids in the operating room and give intravenous antibioticsWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of orbital cellulitis, which is a serious infection of the tissues surrounding the eye. Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are not sufficient to treat orbital cellulitis, as the infection is deep-seated and requires high doses of antibiotics. Incision and drainage of the blisters is not necessary, as this will not improve the outcome of the infection. Debridement of the eyelids is only necessary in cases of severe infection with extensive tissue necrosis.

Title: Rapidly Enlarging Thyroid Mass in a Patient With History of Multiple Cancers Case is: A woman in her 30s noticed a painless left neck mass. She had no history of dysphagia, dyspnea, recent upper respiratory tract infection, injury, or surgery. She also had no weight loss, pain, or fever and had no history of tobacco or alcohol use, radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer, and no previous thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function test results were normal. Physical examination revealed a palpable nontender, firm mass and no cervical lymphadenopathy. She had a medical history of high-grade osteosarcoma with areas of leimyosarcoma of the tibia which had been treated with right above-knee amputation and chemotherapy 4 years prior to presentation. She was followed up in the oncology clinic without any recurrence or metastases. Her last visit was 6 months earlier. She was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix 2 months earlier and was awaiting surgery. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a 6.0 × 3.4 × 4.4-cm calcified left thyroid lobe mass (Figure, A). Positron emission tomography–computed tomographic (PET-CT) imaging showed increased uptake in the left thyroid gland. She underwent a left thyroid lobectomy. The neoplastic cells were positive for p53, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for S-100, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and CD34 (Figure, B).A, Computed tomographic image reveals a calcified mass (blue arrowhead).

Reasoning:

The patient is a woman in her 30s with a history of high-grade osteosarcoma with areas of leimyosarcoma of the tibia which had been treated with right above-knee amputation and chemotherapy 4 years prior to presentation. She was followed up in the oncology clinic without any recurrence or metastases. Her last visit was 6 months earlier. She was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix 2 months earlier and was awaiting surgery. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a 6.0 × 3.4 × 4.4-cm calcified left thyroid lobe mass. Positron emission tomography–computed tomographic (PET-CT) imaging showed increased uptake in the left thyroid gland. She underwent a left thyroid lobectomy. The neoplastic cells were positive for p53, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for S-100, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and CD34.

The most likely diagnosis is metastatic osteosarcoma. The patient has a history of osteosarcoma, and the CT and PET-CT findings are consistent with metastatic disease. The neoplastic cells are positive for p53, which is a known oncogene in osteosarcoma. They are also positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin, which are proteins that are expressed by mesenchymal cells. This suggests that the neoplastic cells are of mesenchymal origin, consistent with osteosarcoma. The neoplastic cells are negative for S-100, TTF-1, and CD34, which are proteins that are expressed by thyroid cells. This suggests that the neoplastic cells are not of thyroid origin.

Title: Facial Rash, Fever, and Anemia in a Newborn Case is: A 19-day-old Japanese male infant presented with a 12-day history of fevers and facial rash. He was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 36 weeks’ gestational age with a birthweight of 3048 g (6.7 lb) with Apgar scores of 9 and 10. There were no complications during the prenatal and perinatal periods. His mother had no history of ringworm infection, positive IgG antibodies against rubella virus and herpes zoster virus, and serology findings negative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and syphilis. His family history was unremarkable.On examination, he had a temperature of 38.0°C, a heart rate of 150/min, and a respiratory rate of 60/min. Slightly scaly annular erythematous plaques with central atrophy and raised margins were present on the forehead and periorbital areas (Figure). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigation showed a white blood cell count of 10.5 ×103/µL (reference range, 4.8-18.5 ×103/μL); hemoglobin level, 7.2 g/dL (8.7-13.5 g/dL); platelet count, 47 × 104/µL (28-91 ×104/μL); aspartate aminotransferase level, 23 IU/L (20-62 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase level, 9 IU/L (11-45 IU/L); serum creatinine level, 0.27 mg/dL (0.12-0.27 mg/dL); uric acid level, 2.6 mg/dL (1.8-5.3 mg/dL); and C-reactive protein level, 6.94 mg/dL (<0.30 mg/dL).Scattered annular erythematous plaques with central atrophy and raised margin on the forehead and periorbital areas of patient.Provide education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizingOrder antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his motherOrder a serologic test for syphilis for the infantWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The rash in this case is most consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). NLE is an autoimmune disease that can occur in infants of mothers who have anti-Ro/SS-A or anti-La/SS-B antibodies. These antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the infant's tissues, including the skin.

Answer: C. Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

The most important next step in the management of this case is to confirm the diagnosis of NLE. This can be done by ordering antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother. If these antibodies are found, it is likely that the infant has NLE.

If the infant is diagnosed with NLE, he will need to be monitored closely for signs of organ involvement. The most common organs affected by NLE are the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The infant may also experience skin rash, joint pain, and fever.

There is no cure for NLE, but the symptoms can be managed with medication. The most common medications used to treat NLE are corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.

With treatment, most infants with NLE have a good prognosis. They will typically grow and develop normally and have no long-term problems.

Title: Cutaneous Nodules in the Genital Area in a Patient With Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease Case is: A white woman in her 60s presented for a routine visit to the outpatient dermatological graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) clinic at Westmead Hospital for review of lichenoid GVHD evolving into sclerodermatous GVHD. The GVHD occurred secondary to a bone marrow transplant in 2014 for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. At the time of review she was being treated with oral azathioprine (50 mg twice daily), tacrolimus (0.5 mg twice daily), and prednisone (25 mg daily) therapy. She was also receiving monthly intravenous immunoglobulin, prophylactic oral fluconazole, acyclovir, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and penicillin. One month prior to commencing oral azathioprine therapy, the patient noted the growth of nodules on the genital and perianal region, with 1 ulcerated nodule in the perianal area associated with painless bleeding on trauma. The lesions were otherwise asymptomatic.On examination she had several yellow-colored nodules, some of them ulcerated with extrusion of yellow-colored discharge on the left labia majora and on the perianal area with surrounding inflammatory reaction (Figure 1). Additionally, she had sclerodermatous plaques on the lower legs, scarring alopecia on the scalp with minimal hyperkeratosis, nail dystrophy and lichenoid changes, erythematous changes in both feet, and desquamation in the lower legs and on the back and arms suggestive of eczematous or postlichenoid changes as part of her lichenoid GVHD. Initial investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 13.1 × 103/μL (to convert to billions per liter, multiply by 0.001); however, the results of the rest of her blood tests including the full blood count and electrolytes, urea and creatinine, and liver function tests were otherwise stable and unremarkable.Clinical photographs of cutaneous nodules in a woman with graft-vs-host disease.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent a bone marrow transplant in 2014. She is currently being treated with oral azathioprine, tacrolimus, and prednisone for chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). She presented with a one-month history of growth of yellow-colored nodules on the genital and perianal region, with one ulcerated nodule in the perianal area associated with painless bleeding on trauma. The lesions were otherwise asymptomatic. On examination, she had several yellow-colored nodules, some of them ulcerated with extrusion of yellow-colored discharge on the left labia majora and on the perianal area with surrounding inflammatory reaction. Additionally, she had sclerodermatous plaques on the lower legs, scarring alopecia on the scalp with minimal hyperkeratosis, nail dystrophy and lichenoid changes, erythematous changes in both feet, and desquamation in the lower legs and on the back and arms suggestive of eczematous or postlichenoid changes as part of her lichenoid GVHD. Initial investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 13.1 × 103/μL; however, the results of the rest of her blood tests including the full blood count and electrolytes, urea and creatinine, and liver function tests were otherwise stable and unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for cutaneous nodules in a patient with GVHD includes a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. Infectious causes include atypical mycobacterial infection, cutaneous malakoplakia, cryptococcosis, and calcinosis cutis. Inflammatory causes include pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. Neoplastic causes include lymphoma, leukemia, and metastatic carcinoma.

In this case, the patient's history of GVHD, the presence of yellow-colored nodules on the genital and perianal region, and the absence of other systemic symptoms or signs make atypical mycobacterial infection the most likely diagnosis. Atypical mycobacterial infection is a common opportunistic infection in patients with GVHD, and it can present with a variety of skin lesions, including nodules, ulcers, and papules. The diagnosis is made by skin biopsy and culture. Treatment is with a combination of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and rifampin.

Title: Another Tattoo Reaction Pitfall:  A Pink Lamb in Wolf’s Clothing Case is: A black woman in her 50s presented to the clinic with a 3-month history of nontender mildly pruritic verrucous nodules in several areas of a polychromatic tattoo on her right lower leg and foot. She reported that these appeared 1 to 2 months following placement of the tattoo and were restricted to areas where the artist created pink zones by layering white ink over red ink. She denied pain, fevers, and chills and had no history of skin cancer. She reported a distant history of discoid lupus, and was taking 2 antihypertensives but no other oral or topical medications. Physical examination revealed well-demarcated erythematous to violaceous verrucous nodules on the right lateral leg and dorsal foot (Figure 1A). A punch biopsy specimen from a representative nodule was obtained, with an additional biopsy for tissue culture (Figure 1B).A, Verrucous nodules are restricted to zones of pink pigment within the tattoo, sparing other colors present.

Physical examination revealed well-demarcated erythematous to violaceous verrucous nodules on the right lateral leg and dorsal foot. A punch biopsy specimen from a representative nodule was obtained, with an additional biopsy for tissue culture.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes:

* Hypertrophic discoid lupus: This is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease that can cause scarring and thickening of the skin. It is more common in women, and is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
* Eruptive keratoacanthomas: These are rapidly growing, benign skin tumors that can appear anywhere on the body. They are more common in older adults, and are often associated with sun exposure.
* Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia: This is a noncancerous condition that can mimic skin cancer. It is often seen in association with chronic inflammation, such as that caused by a tattoo.
* Sarcoidosis: This is an autoimmune disease that can affect any organ in the body, including the skin. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of immune cells.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. This is supported by the patient's history of a recent tattoo, the location of the lesions, and the clinical appearance of the lesions. The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen are also consistent with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who was readmitted with fever and a generalized eruption. Six days prior to this admission, she had been hospitalized for a photo-induced flare of acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ACLE). At readmission, she was febrile with a temperature of 101.5°F, and on examination, she had a worsening, exquisitely tender rash with several blisters across her right arm. Physical examination revealed erythematous plaques with superficial desquamation in the malar distribution of the face, nose, ears, and medial forehead, as well as bilateral extensor arms, chest, posterior neck, and upper back. Several large bullae were located on the right arm. Numerous flat and raised 2-zoned atypical targets with dusky centers were appreciated on the forearms, abdomen, back, thighs, legs, palms and soles.

The patient's laboratory results are consistent with SLE, including a normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positive antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies, antiribonucleoprotein antibodies, and SSA/anti-Ro antibodies. The punch biopsy of an abdominal atypical target lesion shows dyskeratosis with superficial perivascular inflammation and interface changes.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pemphigus erythematosus, generalized fixed drug eruption, Rowell syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Pemphigus erythematosus is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by flaccid bullae on the skin and mucous membranes. Generalized fixed drug eruption is a hypersensitivity reaction to a medication that presents as well-demarcated erythematous plaques with central clearing. Rowell syndrome is a rare, severe form of SLE that presents with fever, rash, and organ involvement. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a life-threatening skin condition characterized by widespread epidermal necrosis.

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus. Pemphigus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune blistering disease characterized by flaccid bullae on the skin and mucous membranes. The disease is caused by autoantibodies to the desmosomal proteins desmoglein 1 and 3. Pemphigus erythematosus is most commonly seen in adults, with a female predominance. The disease can be triggered by sun exposure, medications, or infection. The most common presentation is with flaccid bullae on the skin, particularly the face, hands, and feet. The bullae can be painful and may rupture, leaving erosions and crusts. The mucous membranes, including the mouth, eyes, and genitals, can also be involved. The diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus is made by biopsy of a skin lesion. The biopsy shows subepidermal blisters with acantholysis, which is the separation of keratinocytes from each other. Treatment for pemphigus erythematosus is with systemic corticosteroids. Other immunosuppressive medications, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, may also be used. The prognosis for pemphigus erythematosus is generally good with treatment. However, the disease can be chronic and relapsing.

Title: Man With Recurrent Paralysis and Cerebral White Matter Lesions Case is: A 21-year-old man was admitted to the hospital owing to recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness over the course of 3 days. Although these symptoms had resolved after 3 hours’ rest, they recurred 2 hours prior to hospital admission. In addition, the patient had begun to experience weakness and numbness of his limbs, with more severe symptoms on the right side. The symptoms began to gradually resolve 2 hours following admission, and normal function had returned within 2 days. No significant history of illness was noted in the patient or among family members.Neurological examination on admission revealed normal mental status, and the results of cranial nerve examination were normal. Although the patient had cavus feet, no atrophy was observed in the distal lower limbs (Figure, A). Muscle strength was classified as grade 4 for the left limbs and grade 3 for the right limbs, according to Medical Research Council criteria, and muscle tone was diminished. The sensory examination was unremarkable. Deep reflexes were diminished or absent. However, bilateral positive Babinski signs were observed. Results from laboratory examinations, including blood electrolytes, cerebrospinal fluid, and lactate, were normal. Oligonucleotide bands and aquaporin 4 detection were negative. Craniocervical computed tomographic angiography results were normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormal bilateral increases in T2 signal and diffusion restriction in the periventricular areas and the splenium of corpus callosum (Figure, B). Interestingly, a significant reduction of the abnormal signal was noted on MRI 3 months later. Electrophysiological examination of peripheral nerves revealed extensive bilateral nerve conduction abnormalities. Significantly reduced motor nerve conduction velocity was also observed in the median nerves (38.3 m per second in the left and 36.5 m per second in the right).A, Image shows patient’s pes cavus. B, Patient’s brain axial diffusion-weighted image at admission. Demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Transient ischemic attack , B: Demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) , C: Periodic paralysis , D: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient presented with recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness. These symptoms are characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. MS is characterized by the formation of plaques of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques can disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses, leading to a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, tingling, vision problems, and balance problems.

The patient's history and physical examination were also consistent with MS. He had no significant past medical history, and his family history was negative for MS. His neurological examination revealed normal mental status, but he had weakness and numbness of his limbs, with more severe symptoms on the right side. He also had a positive Babinski sign, which is a sign of upper motor neuron dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory tests were normal, which does not support a diagnosis of an infectious or inflammatory condition. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also normal, which does not support a diagnosis of a demyelinating disease such as MS.

The patient's brain MRI revealed abnormal bilateral increases in T2 signal and diffusion restriction in the periventricular areas and the splenium of corpus callosum. These findings are characteristic of MS.

The patient's electrophysiological examination of peripheral nerves revealed extensive bilateral nerve conduction abnormalities. This finding is also consistent with MS.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is MS.

Title: The Mystery of the Locking Eye Case is: A 66-year-old woman with a remote history of a pituitary macroadenoma was referred to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic for intermittent diplopia of several years’ duration. Diplopia was frequently present after repeatedly changing direction of gaze. She also noted mild right ptosis. Her visual acuity was unaffected. There was no associated headache or ocular or periorbital pain. She had not noticed any injection of the sclera. Her family and friends made no comments regarding exophthalmos. She had not noticed any deficits in axial or appendicular strength, rapid fatigability, or dysphagia. Her symptoms did not exhibit diurnal variation. Her weight was stable. She had not noted any changes in her hair, skin, or nails. She had no subjective disturbance of thermoregulation. Her relevant history included a pituitary macroadenoma, which had been resected 30 years prior, followed by radiation. There was no evidence of subsequent recurrence. There was no family history of ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or myopathy. The patient was a retired English teacher.Examination demonstrated anisocoria (right pupil larger than left), which was accentuated in bright ambient light; mild right ptosis; and mildly restricted supraduction, adduction, and infraduction of the right eye (Video, prepared by N.T.). The second half of the Video (from 24 seconds on) demonstrates marked restriction of elevation, depression, and abduction in the right eye after eccentric gaze. Ductions in the left eye were normal. The patient’s neurological examination demonstrated a normal level of consciousness, fluent speech, normal comprehension, good attention, normal cranial nerve function aside from the aforementioned deficits, full strength, normal sensation to proprioception and temperature, symmetric reflexes, absence of ataxia, and a stable, narrow-based gait.

The most likely diagnosis is **ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve**. This is a rare disorder characterized by involuntary contractions of the extraocular muscles, resulting in diplopia and ptosis. It is most commonly caused by a lesion of the third cranial nerve, but it can also occur in the absence of any structural abnormality. The diagnosis is made clinically, based on the history and examination findings. There is no specific treatment, but symptoms can be managed with medications such as carbamazepine or baclofen.

Other possible diagnoses include **ocular myasthenia gravis**, **giant cell arteritis**, and **cavernous sinus syndrome**. However, these diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history and examination findings.

Title: Action Tremor, Impaired Balance, and Executive Dysfunction in Midlife Case is: A 58-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of severe and progressive action tremor in his dominant hand when writing. When questioned, he described subtle balance problems without falls developing over the past 3 years. With the exception of profound difficulties with handwriting, motor symptoms did not affect livelihood or activities of daily living. There was no tremor reported in the nondominant hand or other limbs or symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Neither he nor his wife reported any changes in cognitive function. His medical history comprised surgeries of the hand (laceration repair), leg (fracture repair), knee (reconstruction), and ear (stapedectomy); these were not related to the presenting symptoms. He had a family history of ischemic heart disease (both parents) but no family history of neurological disorder. He exercised regularly (5 times per week) and consumed 2 to 4 standard drinks per week. He was a former smoker with a 2-year pack history and denied any illicit drug use.Cognitive testing revealed deficits in executive function and speed of information processing. Examination of eye movements and speech revealed jerky eye pursuit, saccadic dysmetria, and moderate slurring of speech. Additional motor signs included abnormal handwriting (Figure 1A), bilateral intention tremor, mild rigidity (upper extremities), and moderately impaired heel tapping. Facial expression was normal. There was no head or resting tremor. He demonstrated moderate body sway while standing, was unable to stand on 1 foot for more than 10 seconds, and had impaired tandem walking.

The most likely diagnosis is multiple system atrophy (MSA). MSA is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system. It is characterized by a combination of motor, autonomic, and cerebellar symptoms. The most common motor symptom is tremor, which is usually present in both hands. Other motor symptoms may include gait instability, postural instability, and falls. Autonomic symptoms may include orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. Cerebellar symptoms may include ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus.

The diagnosis of MSA is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. There is no cure for MSA, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

Title: Multiple Skin Changes on the Lower Back of a Neonate Case is: An 11-day-old, full-term girl presented for evaluation of multiple skin changes that were noted at birth (Figure). These skin changes included a red patch on the central lower back with a soft nodule located on top of the patch. Additionally, she had a pedunculated red papule positioned on top of the red stain and soft nodule. She was asymptomatic, moving all limbs, urinating, and defecating normally. Her prenatal screens, including 20-week ultrasonography, were normal. Pregnancy was uncomplicated and there was no history of teratogenic exposure or family history of congenital defects. Ultrasonography of the spine obtained prior to the visit showed no abnormalities.Photograph depicting a red patch with overlying soft nodule and red pedunculated papule in the lower midback of a neonate.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Teratoma , B: Spinal dysraphism , C: Dermoid cyst , D: Hemangioma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The most likely diagnosis for this neonate is a hemangioma. Hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels that are common in newborns. They are usually present at birth or appear within the first few weeks of life. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the head, neck, and face. They are typically soft, raised, and red or purple in color. Hemangiomas usually grow rapidly during the first few months of life, then stabilize and slowly regress over time. Most hemangiomas resolve completely by age 5.

In this case, the neonate has a red patch with overlying soft nodule and red pedunculated papule in the lower midback. These skin changes are consistent with a hemangioma. The neonate is asymptomatic, which is also consistent with a hemangioma. The prenatal screens and ultrasonography of the spine were normal, which also supports the diagnosis of a hemangioma.

Title: Treatment of Severe Hypercholesterolemia in a Woman With Advanced Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Case is: A 30-year-old woman was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) during pregnancy at age 25 years. She was normocholesterolemic prior to the diagnosis of PSC (total cholesterol [TC], 188 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]). Following the diagnosis of PSC, she developed moderate hypercholesterolemia (representative TC, 256 mg/dL). She first noted the appearance of periorbital xanthelasmata 2 years after PSC diagnosis (Figure 1A). Approximately 6 months prior to referral, she developed marked worsening of biliary obstruction, deterioration of liver function, and clinical jaundice (aspartate aminotransferase, 145 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 111 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 726 U/L; and bilirubin, 6.7mg/dL), and she noted palmar xanthomata in the creases of her palms and fingers (Figure 1B). Periorbital xanthelasmata (A, arrowheads) and palmar xanthomata (B, arrowheads) in a patient with severe hypercholesterolemia and primary sclerosing cholangitis.At the time of referral, she had severe hypercholesterolemia (TC, 832 mg/dL; triglycerides, 114 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113]; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 18 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not calculated). Medications at the time of referral were 1000 mg per day of ursodeoxycholic acid and 2 g of colestipol twice daily for symptomatic relief of pruritus. The majority of TC (719 mg/dL) consisted of free cholesterol (518 mg/dL) instead of the usual esterified cholesterol. Serum phospholipids levels were high (1186 mg/dL), while triglycerides were normal (97 mg/dL). Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis of serum lipoproteins, after ultracentrifugation to remove very-low-density lipoprotein, indicated the unique composition and distribution of lipid classes in a special form of dyslipidemia known as lipoprotein X (LpX), ie, high unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids in large lipid-containing particles. Based on results of analysis of genomic DNA in a custom targeted lipid gene resequencing panel, she had no rare mutations in 25 genes known to be associated with abnormal lipid traits (including LDLR, APOB, PSCK9, LDLRAP1, APOE, ABCG5, ABCG8, LIPA, and STAP1) and had APOE E3/E3 genotype.1Begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per dayWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient has severe hypercholesterolemia with a unique lipid profile consistent with lipoprotein X. This is a rare disorder that is characterized by high levels of free cholesterol and phospholipids in large lipid-containing particles. It is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.

Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma or albumin. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including lipoprotein X. TPE can lower cholesterol levels and improve liver function in patients with lipoprotein X.

Rosuvastatin is a statin that is used to lower cholesterol levels. It is the first-line treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, rosuvastatin is not effective in treating lipoprotein X.

In this case, the patient has severe hypercholesterolemia with a unique lipid profile consistent with lipoprotein X. She also has PSC, a chronic liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The best treatment for this patient is TPE. TPE can lower cholesterol levels and improve liver function in patients with lipoprotein X.

Title: Middle Ear Mass Causing Vertigo and Facial Nerve Weakness Case is: An elderly woman presented with 2 episodes of vertigo lasting a few minutes while stationary over 1 day and a several-year history of right-sided hearing loss. She had not experienced otalgia, otorrhea, or tinnitus. Physical examination revealed a mass obstructing the right external auditory canal and House-Brackmann grade 2 facial nerve weakness on the right. Audiogram revealed right-sided moderate to profound mixed hearing loss. Computed tomography revealed a soft-tissue mass emanating from the middle ear involving the facial canal with surrounding bony erosion, including dehiscence of the tegmen, cochlea, bony labyrinth, lateral semicircular canal, and jugular foramen. The patient underwent transtemporal mastoidectomy and debulking. However, owing to the mass’s vascularity and significant bleeding, the operation was aborted, and she was sent for embolization (Figure, A). Magnetic resonance imaging during embolization revealed intense enhancement in the right middle ear extending from the epitympanum to the hypotympanum with extension into the right external auditory canal (Figure, B). She returned to the operating room, and the vascular mass was found to extend inferiorly to the jugular bulb and carotid and anteriorly into the eustachian tube. The mass was adherent to the underlying bone and had invaded the facial canal but not the nerve itself. Both malleus and incus were eroded. Immunohistochemical stains of the specimen indicated cells positive for synaptophysin with a sustentacular pattern of cells positive for S-100 (Figure, C and D).A, Mastoidectomy, visualization of vascular mass.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is middle ear paraganglioma. Middle ear paragangliomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are found in the head and neck. They are most commonly found in the temporal bone, but they can also occur in the carotid body, jugular bulb, and other locations.

Middle ear paragangliomas typically present with hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial nerve paralysis. They can also cause vertigo, headache, and cranial nerve palsies. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment typically involves surgical resection.

Title: A Cystic Lesion of the Lower Lip Case is: A man in his 50s was referred to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery for evaluation and treatment of an intraoral cystic lesion of the left lower lip. This lesion had developed spontaneously 3 months prior to consultation without an identifiable inciting event. He could recall no trauma and described a slow but progressive increase in the volume of this otherwise asymptomatic lesion. His medical history revealed a long-term history of substance abuse with active alcohol and tobacco consumption, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and epilepsy (tonic-clonic seizures, badly controlled owing to a lack of adherence to therapy). Clinical intraoral examination of this fully edentulous patient revealed a nontender, mobile, cystic nodule, approximately 1 × 1 cm on the vestibular side of the lower left lip with outflow of a clear serous fluid on palpation (Figure, A). The lesion was excised surgically and the specimen sent for additional histological examination. After hematoxylin-eosin staining, light microscopy revealed an endophytic growing lesion, which consisted of an acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds, with at its periphery an infiltrating border. At the surface of these papillae, the epithelium was sometimes columnar. Mucocytes were present, individually dispersed throughout the epithelium, but also organized in small tubuloacinar structures emptying onto the surface. The epithelium was infiltrated by neutrophils. Atypia or mitotic figures were absent, and the subepithelial stroma contained normal-appearing seromucous acini (Figure, B and C).A, Clinical presentation of the cystic lesion of the lower left lip.

Reasoning: The patient is a man in his 50s with a history of substance abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and epilepsy. He presents with a nontender, mobile, cystic nodule on the vestibular side of the lower left lip. The lesion was excised surgically and the specimen sent for histological examination. The histopathology report revealed an endophytic growing lesion, which consisted of an acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds, with at its periphery an infiltrating border. At the surface of these papillae, the epithelium was sometimes columnar. Mucocytes were present, individually dispersed throughout the epithelium, but also organized in small tubuloacinar structures emptying onto the surface. The epithelium was infiltrated by neutrophils. Atypia or mitotic figures were absent, and the subepithelial stroma contained normal-appearing seromucous acini.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathology findings, the most likely diagnosis is intraductal papilloma. Intraductal papillomas are benign epithelial tumors that arise from the ducts of salivary glands. They are most commonly seen in the parotid gland, but can also occur in the submandibular and sublingual glands. Intraductal papillomas are typically asymptomatic, but may present with a mass or a feeling of fullness in the affected gland. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Other possible diagnoses include mucoepidermoid carcinoma, mucocele, and oral inverted ductal papilloma. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are malignant epithelial tumors that arise from the ducts of salivary glands. They are the most common type of salivary gland carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas can present with a mass, pain, or facial nerve paralysis. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision with radiation therapy. Mucoceles are non-neoplastic, fluid-filled cysts that arise from salivary glands. They are most commonly seen in the lower lip. Mucoceles typically present as a soft, fluctuant mass. The diagnosis is made clinically. Treatment is usually incision and drainage. Oral inverted ductal papillomas are benign epithelial tumors that arise from the ducts of salivary glands. They are most commonly seen in the palate. Oral inverted ductal papillomas typically present as a small, raised lesion. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Title: Recurrent Unilateral Swelling of the Parotid Gland Case is: A 45-year-old woman initially presented for evaluation of a 6-month history of intermittent left facial swelling and pain. She noted a discretely palpable mass in the left parotid region during these episodes. However, at the time of clinic presentation, she had no palpable masses on physical examination. Ultrasonography performed on the day of initial evaluation revealed no intraparotid masses, lesions, or stones. The patient was encouraged to return if she noticed acute return of swelling so that she could be evaluated when symptomatic. The patient returned days later with acutely worsening left facial swelling, which she noticed while straining. On presentation, she was diagnosed as having malignant hypertension and had a palpable parotid lesion noted on physical examination. When asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver, she was noted to have more pronounced left facial swelling (Figure, A). A short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image is shown in the Figure, B.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a 6-month history of intermittent left facial swelling and pain. She noted a discretely palpable mass in the left parotid region during these episodes. However, at the time of clinic presentation, she had no palpable masses on physical examination. Ultrasonography performed on the day of initial evaluation revealed no intraparotid masses, lesions, or stones. The patient was encouraged to return if she noticed acute return of swelling so that she could be evaluated when symptomatic. The patient returned days later with acutely worsening left facial swelling, which she noticed while straining. On presentation, she was diagnosed as having malignant hypertension and had a palpable parotid lesion noted on physical examination. When asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver, she was noted to have more pronounced left facial swelling. A short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image is shown in the Figure, B. Magnetic resonance angiogram was obtained (Figure, C and D).

The most likely diagnosis is **arteriovenous malformation (AVM)**. AVMs are congenital lesions that result from abnormal connections between arteries and veins. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the brain, spinal cord, and liver. AVMs can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size and location. Symptoms of AVMs in the head and neck can include facial swelling, headache, seizures, and bleeding.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of AVM. The patient has a history of intermittent left facial swelling and pain, which is a common symptom of AVMs. The patient also has a palpable parotid mass, which is another common finding in AVMs. The patient's facial swelling worsened when she performed a Valsalva maneuver, which is a sign of increased blood flow to the area. The STIR image shows a T2 hyperintense lesion involving the left parotid gland and extending to the left side of the neck. This is a characteristic finding of AVMs. The magnetic resonance angiogram shows no evidence of significant high flow component. This is also a characteristic finding of AVMs.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of AVM. The most likely diagnosis is **arteriovenous malformation (AVM)**.

Title: Acquired Diplopia in a Child Case is: A 6-year-old girl presented to the ophthalmology emergency service with 4 days of double vision associated with headache and fever. She had a history of upper respiratory tract infection with nasal congestion and discharge being treated with oral antibiotics. She also recently received a diagnosis of migraines. Computed tomographic imaging from an outside hospital 3 weeks prior was reported as unremarkable. The patient had an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/50 OU. Her pupils were round and reactive without an afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual fields revealed superotemporal, inferotemporal, and superonasal defects in both eyes. The results of her motility examination showed a complete absence of abduction on both eyes, consistent with bilateral sixth nerve palsy. The results of a fundus examination showed blurred optic nerve margins nasally (Figure 1).Fundus photographs demonstrating blurred nasal margins of the right (A) and left (B) discs.What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:

The patient has a history of upper respiratory tract infection and recent diagnosis of migraines. She presents with double vision, headache, and fever. Her uncorrected visual acuity is 20/50 OU, her pupils are round and reactive without an afferent pupillary defect, and her confrontation visual fields reveal superotemporal, inferotemporal, and superonasal defects in both eyes. The results of her motility examination show a complete absence of abduction on both eyes, consistent with bilateral sixth nerve palsy. The results of a fundus examination show blurred optic nerve margins nasally.

The differential diagnosis for bilateral sixth nerve palsy includes:

* Idiopathic sixth nerve palsy (the most common cause)
* Trauma
* Tumor
* Infection
* Vascular disease
* Inflammatory disease

In this case, the patient's history of upper respiratory tract infection and recent diagnosis of migraines suggests an inflammatory cause. The blurred optic nerve margins on fundus examination support this diagnosis.

The next step in management is to refer the patient to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be helpful to rule out other causes of the sixth nerve palsy. Treatment for an inflammatory sixth nerve palsy typically includes corticosteroids.

Answer:

The correct answer is B. Refer to neurology department.

Title: Rapid Loss of Vision With the Onset of a White Ring Surrounding the Optic Nerve Case is: A white man in his 50s initially presented in the fall of 2015 with “macular changes” noticed by his referring optometrist. The patient was asymptomatic at the time. He had a history of hypertension and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which was last treated in 2012 without evidence of recurrence. His visual acuity was 20/25 OU, and neither fundus was seen to be abnormal. The vitreous was clear in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed vitreomacular adhesion in the right eye and a macular posterior vitreous detachment in the left. The patient was told to follow-up as needed.About 2 months later, the patient called on the telephone to say that he had a new onset of blurry vision and photopsias in the right eye that started about 2 days prior. He denied any recent viral-type illness. An examination revealed that his visual acuity was still 20/25 OU. The anterior segment and the anterior vitreous of his right eye were still clear. However, an examination of the posterior pole of the right eye revealed a light white, deep subretinal/choroidal ring surrounding the optic nerve, with smaller rings around the edge of the larger ring (Figure, A). The left eye still appeared normal. Optical coherence tomography of the right eye revealed loss of the outer retina (more nasal than temporal to the fovea), whereas OCT of the left eye revealed that it was normal (Figure, B). The results of fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence were both unremarkable (data not shown).A, Fundus photograph of the right eye at the time of presentation shows a white-gray ring centered on the optic nerve. B, Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the right eye reveals significant loss of the outer retina, especially nasal to the fovea.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a white ring surrounding the optic nerve, which is a characteristic finding of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). CSC is a self-limiting condition that usually resolves without treatment within a few months. However, in some cases, it can lead to permanent vision loss. The most common treatment for CSC is to use oral prednisone. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps to reduce inflammation in the retina. In addition to oral prednisone, other treatments that may be used for CSC include laser therapy and photodynamic therapy.

Title: Vision Loss With Pachymeningeal Enhancement on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Case is: A man in his 50s with a history of hypertension and sleep apnea presented with a 6-week history of progressive, bilateral vision loss while receiving treatment with oral steroids and amoxicillin-clavulanate from his primary care physician. He also had associated ear pain, hearing loss, and severe headaches.On presentation, his visual acuity was light perception OD and 20/600 at 1 m OS. The right eye had a 1+ afferent pupillary defect. He also had ear drainage with inflamed tympanic membranes and ear tubes in place bilaterally. A dilated fundus examination revealed grade 2 optic disc edema with an inferior disc hemorrhage in the right eye and grade 1 edema in the left eye. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.Laboratory results revealed elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates at 78 mg/L and 77 mm/h, respectively, with negative antinuclear antibody test results (to convert C-reactive protein to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). His white blood cell count was elevated at 14 910/μL without eosinophilia (to convert to × 109/L, multiply by 0.001). Cerebrospinal fluid studies were remarkable only for an elevated white blood cell count of 72/μL (79% lymphocytes) and elevated protein level at 97 mg/L, while Gram stain and culture were negative. Opening pressure was 17 cm H2O.A magnetic resonance venogram with and without contrast ruled out venous occlusions. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse pachymeningeal (dural-arachnoid) enhancement (Figure) without leptomeningeal (pial) enhancement, left-sided mastoiditis, and subtle optic nerve enhancement.Coronal T1 with gadolinium showing dural enhancement (blue arrowhead) and optic nerve enhancement (white arrowheads).What Would You Do Next? A: Quantiferon gold , B: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing , C: Rapid plasma reagin , D: Angiotensin-converting enzyme level. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's presentation is concerning for an inflammatory disorder of the meninges, such as sarcoidosis or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. These disorders can cause pachymeningeal enhancement on MRI, as seen in this case. Quantiferon gold testing is used to diagnose tuberculosis, which is not a likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's age, lack of risk factors for tuberculosis, and negative chest radiograph. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing is used to diagnose Wegener granulomatosis, which is a vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system. However, Wegener granulomatosis is typically associated with a more acute presentation than this patient's, and it is not typically associated with mastoiditis. Rapid plasma reagin testing is used to screen for syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a variety of neurological manifestations, including meningitis. However, syphilis is not a likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's age and lack of risk factors for syphilis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme level is a test that is used to screen for sarcoidosis, which is a multisystem inflammatory disorder that can affect the lungs, skin, eyes, and nervous system. Given the patient's presentation and the findings on MRI, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Therefore, the next step in management is to order antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing to confirm the diagnosis.

Title: Retinal Vascular Changes in a Young Woman Case is: A woman in her teens with no relevant medical history was brought to the hospital for personality changes, headache, and decreased vision bilaterally. Review of systems was remarkable for concomitant hearing loss and vertigo for 1 month. She was alert but confused and disoriented, and she manifested gait imbalance and ataxia. White blood cell count was elevated at 14 600/μL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). Results from computed tomography of the head were normal, but magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multifocal punctate areas of restricted diffusion. A lumbar puncture showed lymphocytosis (80%), normal glucose levels, and protein levels greater than 125 mg/dL. Results from cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction were negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Results from laboratory tests for hypercoagulable states, antinucleolar antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis were unrevealing.Ophthalmology was consulted. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal pupil response, visual fields to finger counting, motility, and intraocular pressure. Anterior segment biomicroscopy was normal without vitreous cell or haze. The optic discs were pink with sharp margins. The macula appeared flat, and there were scattered peripheral retinal hemorrhages and areas of retinal vascular nonperfusion in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography showed inner retinal thinning with preservation of outer retinal architecture. Fluorescein angiography showed multiple retinal arteriolar occlusions with variable leakage (Figure).In this widefield fluorescein angiography, there are multiple areas of retinal artery occlusion not at branch points, with prominent leakage of fluorescein dye at some of the occlusions in each eye.Administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression for Susac syndromeGive intravenous acyclovir and intravitreal foscarnet for viral retinitisObserve for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathyWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: Multiple Injuries in Blunt Abdominal Trauma Case is: A 24-year-old man was brought to the emergency department after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He was a restrained driver noted to be awake at the scene of the collision and had to be extracted from the vehicle. He was hemodynamically stable on route to the hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was awake but restless and combative and was subsequently intubated. He was hypotensive on arrival but responded transiently to fluid resuscitation. Multiple closed long bone fractures of the upper and lower extremities were noted. The chest radiography (Figure 1A) showed marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The pelvic radiography revealed an unstable fracture involving bilateral pubic rami and the left sacroiliac joint. The pelvis was splinted in the emergency department. He remained transiently responsive to fluid resuscitation and was taken for emergent computed tomography. Computed tomography of the head and cervical spine showed no evidence of injury.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with factor 1 deficiency who presents with a history of multiple episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. These episodes started approximately 4 years prior, occur approximately every 3 to 4 months, and are associated with crampy abdominal pain. Although she has been hospitalized, she never required a transfusion. Colonoscopies were significant only for diverticulosis without a clear source of bleeding. Her previous abdominal surgery included a hysterectomy for menorrhagia. There is no family history of colon cancer.

Physical examination showed no abnormalities. She had computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis that showed eccentric and irregular masslike thickening of the sigmoid colon of approximately 7 cm with a wall thickness of 1.4 cm. Repeat colonoscopy showed an exquisitely painful nodule at the rectosigmoid junction. There were no stigmata of recent bleed, and biopsy showed normal colonic mucosa.

The most likely diagnosis is sigmoid endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This tissue can grow in the pelvis, abdomen, and other areas of the body. Endometriosis can cause pain, infertility, and other problems.

The patient's history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, crampy abdominal pain, and a hysterectomy for menorrhagia are all consistent with endometriosis. The computed tomography scan shows a masslike thickening of the sigmoid colon, which is a common finding in endometriosis. The repeat colonoscopy showed an exquisitely painful nodule at the rectosigmoid junction, which is also a common finding in endometriosis. The biopsy showed normal colonic mucosa, which is consistent with endometriosis because endometriosis does not typically cause inflammation or ulceration of the bowel.

Title: Headache in the Setting of Immunotherapy Treatment for Metastatic Melanoma Case is: A 56-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab every 3 weeks developed headaches during the course of her treatment. In the week following her first treatment, the patient reported a few mild morning headaches that improved with acetaminophen. After receiving 3 cycles of ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg, and nivolumab, 1 mg/kg, and 8 weeks after her first treatment, the patient reported experiencing daily headaches for at least the prior week and a half. The location of her headaches varied, and there was no associated eye or temple pain. At best, with taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the headache decreased to pain rated 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Also at this time, the patient reported low energy levels and difficulty reading; however, physical examination showed no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup conducted 8 weeks after initiating treatment included adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels that were measured at 25 pg/mL (reference range, 10-60 pg/mL) and 16.8 μg/dL (reference range, 6-24 μg/dL), respectively. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.82 mIU/L (reference range, 0.5-5.0 mIU/L), which was gradually decreasing compared with 1.41 mIU/L 5 weeks earlier and 1.21 mIU/L 2 weeks earlier. Her total triiodothyronine level was measured at 73 ng/dL (reference range, 80-200 ng/dL) and free thyroxine level was 1.0 ng/dL (reference range, 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). Her serum sodium level was measured at 138 mEq/L; 1 week later it was measured at 135 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed for further assessment (Figure).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain obtained 8 weeks after initiating ipilimumab (A-C) and nivolumab treatment and at follow-up (D).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Brain metastasis , B: Immune-related hypophysitis , C: Pituitary adenoma , D: Mucocele. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who developed headaches during the course of her immunotherapy treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. The headaches started after receiving 3 cycles of treatment and were daily, with no associated eye or temple pain. The patient also reported low energy levels and difficulty reading. Physical examination showed no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup showed an elevated ACTH level, a decreased cortisol level, a decreased TSH level, and an elevated sodium level. MRI of the brain showed a hypointense lesion in the pituitary gland.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis. Immune-related hypophysitis is a rare but serious complication of immunotherapy treatment for cancer. It is caused by an autoimmune reaction that attacks the pituitary gland, which is a small gland located at the base of the brain that produces hormones that control many important body functions, including metabolism, growth, and reproduction.

The symptoms of immune-related hypophysitis can vary depending on which hormones are affected. The most common symptoms are headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms may include visual problems, hair loss, and weight gain.

The diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. MRI of the brain can show a hypointense lesion in the pituitary gland, which is a characteristic finding of immune-related hypophysitis.

There is no cure for immune-related hypophysitis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment usually involves a combination of corticosteroids and other medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the pituitary gland.

The prognosis for patients with immune-related hypophysitis varies depending on the severity of the disease. With treatment, most patients experience improvement in their symptoms. However, some patients may have permanent damage to the pituitary gland, which can lead to long-term problems.

Title: Woman With Yellow Palms and Soles Case is: A 29-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of yellowing skin on her palms and soles. She was previously healthy, did not consume alcohol, and had no personal or family history of liver disease. She took no prescription medications; however, approximately 6 months prior to the onset of symptoms, she began taking a nutritional supplement (Nature Made Beta Carotene, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) manufactured in Japan and available online in China. This supplement contained 1.8 mg of beta carotene per tablet, and she had been taking 2 tablets daily for the past 6 months. She had no other dietary changes during this period, in particular, no increased intake of carrots or other yellow- or orange-colored fruits or vegetables. Physical examination revealed yellow-orange pigmentation of her palms and soles (Figure). There was no scleral icterus. Results of laboratory tests, including measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, hemoglobin A1c, and total and direct bilirubin levels, ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine, as well as fasting lipid profile and thyroid function tests, were normal.Yellowish orange pigmentation of the patient’s palms and soles, as compared with a nonpigmented palm in the center.Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplementWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: Acute Anuric Renal Failure in an 80-Year-Old Man Case is: An 80-year-old man with a history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease presented with 2 days of anuria. He felt well until 6 days prior, when he awoke with diffuse muscle cramps following a strenuous day of moving boxes. He subsequently developed oliguria that progressed to anuria. His only medication was omeprazole (20 mg daily). His usual fluid intake had not changed.Physical examination was notable for moist mucous membranes, clear lungs, no lower extremity or periorbital edema, and no jugular venous distension. Examination was otherwise unremarkable. Bladder scan showed 50 mL of urine, which was collected via straight catheterization. Three liters of normal saline was administered, with no further urine production.Laboratory testing revealed a blood urea nitrogen level of 90 mg/dL (32.1 mmol/L) (reference range, 7-21 mg/dL [2.5-7.5 mmol/L]) and creatinine level of 14.1 mg/dL (1246.4 μmol/L) (reference range, 0.6-1.17 mg/dL [53.0-103.4 μmol/L]); baseline levels 3 months prior were 37 mg/dL (13.2 mmol/L) and 3.3 mg/dL (291.7 μmol/L), respectively. Hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL (reference range, 13-17 g/dL); calcium, 8.1 mg/dL (reference range, 8.5-10.1 mg/dL); potassium, 6.2 mmol/L (reference range, 3.5-4.7 mmol/L); and phosphorous 8.8 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) (reference range, 2.5-4.9 mg/dL [0.81-1.58 mmol/L]). Creatine kinase level was within normal limits. Urinalysis showed minimal albuminuria (100 mg/dL); however, spot urine protein to creatinine ratio predicted 11 139 mg/g (reference range, 0-200 mg/g) proteinuria. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis identified a small monoclonal IgG κ band. Serum κ free light chain (FLC) level was 20 765 mg/L (reference range, 3.3-19.4 mg/L) with a free κ to λ ratio of 296 (reference range, 0.37-3.1).1 Hemodialysis was initiated and a bone marrow biopsy obtained.Bone marrow biopsy showed a normocellular bone marrow with 10% κ-restricted plasma cells (Figure, left panel).

**Reasoning:**

The patient's presentation is consistent with multiple myeloma, a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The most common presenting features of multiple myeloma are bone pain, anemia, renal failure, and hypercalcemia. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made based on the findings of a bone marrow biopsy, which shows a clonal proliferation of plasma cells, and serum and urine protein electrophoresis, which shows the presence of a monoclonal protein.

The treatment of multiple myeloma is based on the stage of the disease. In the case of patients with symptomatic disease, such as the patient in the case presentation, treatment is typically with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The goal of treatment is to control the proliferation of plasma cells and to improve the patient's quality of life.

In the case presentation, the patient's bone marrow biopsy shows a normocellular bone marrow with 10% κ-restricted plasma cells. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates positivity for the plasma cell marker CD138. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.

The patient's serum κ free light chain (FLC) level is 20 765 mg/L, which is significantly elevated. The free κ to λ ratio is 296, which is also significantly elevated. These findings are consistent with the presence of a monoclonal protein in the patient's serum.

The patient's renal ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis. This finding is reassuring, as it suggests that the patient's renal failure is not due to obstruction of the urinary tract.

The patient's treatment should be initiated with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The goal of treatment is to control the proliferation of plasma cells and to improve the patient's quality of life.

Reasoning: The patient is a 35-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with 4 days of fever (temperature up to 39°C), extreme weakness, fatigue, and 1 to 2 days of progressive confusion. He was born in the United States but had traveled to Sierra Leone for a period of 3 weeks and had returned 1 week prior to presentation. He did not take any form of malaria prophylaxis, nor did he use insect repellent while traveling. He previously received the yellow fever vaccine but not hepatitis A or typhoid vaccination.Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39.3°C, heart rate of 120/min, blood pressure of 119/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 32/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient was jaundiced, with scleral icterus, and was alert and oriented, although he had a fluctuating attention span and was unable to complete basic tasks. He was able to localize painful stimuli. No retinal lesions were present on dilated ophthalmologic examination. Laboratory tests were notable for a white blood cell count of 5000/μL with 88% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 1% bands, 5% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 0% eosinophils; hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 25 ×103/μL. Sodium level was 132 mEq/L; potassium, 4.0 mEq/L; chloride, 100 mEq/L; carbon dioxide, 15 mEq/L; blood urea nitrogen, 40 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL. Total bilirubin level was 23.9 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 252 U/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 100 U/L. Venous lactate level was 49.6 mg/dL. A computed tomography scan of the head was unremarkable. A thin preparation blood smear was obtained (Figure).The thin preparation smear of blood obtained from patient (Wright-Giemsa, original magnification ×100).

The patient's clinical presentation and travel history are consistent with malaria. The thin preparation blood smear shows malaria parasites, which confirms the diagnosis. The most likely species of malaria is Plasmodium falciparum, which is the most severe form of malaria. The patient should be started on treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, which is the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria.

Reasoning:
The patient is a healthy man in his 20s with a several-month history of asymptomatic, slightly erythematous cutaneous nodules, measuring 1.5 to 3.0 cm, over the calcanea. Physical examination revealed violaceous plaques, measuring 2 to 3 cm, on the extensor surface of the knees, bilaterally. Excisional biopsy specimens were obtained.

The histopathologic findings show a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes in the dermis. There is also evidence of mucin deposition and fibrosis. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of knee-located erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component.

EED is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by the development of violaceous plaques and nodules on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. The disease is more common in women than men and typically occurs in middle-aged adults. The cause of EED is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

The clinical presentation of EED is variable. The most common initial finding is a single violaceous plaque or nodule. However, the disease can also present with multiple lesions or with a diffuse rash. The lesions of EED are typically asymptomatic, but they can be pruritic or painful.

The diagnosis of EED is made based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings. The treatment of EED is aimed at controlling the inflammation. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary for severe cases.

Title: Papulovesicular Eruption in a Pregnant Woman With Darier Disease Case is: A primigravida woman in her 30s at 35 weeks’ gestation and with a history of Darier disease was admitted with an acute, painful eruption on her face and neck. She reported no history of pregnancy-related complications. Physical examination revealed confluent erythema with keratotic papulovesicles distributed on the face and neck (Figure, A). Honey-colored crusts were present on the left ear and preauricular area. The chest and inframammary area displayed occasional red, crusted papules. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 17.18 × 103/μL (reference range, 4.50-11.00 × 103/μL).

Histopathological images showed full-thickness epidermal necrosis with focal areas of suprabasal acantholysis with corp ronds, corp grains, and parakeratosis. Multinucleated cells with nuclear molding and margination were also present.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is pemphigoid gestationis. Pemphigoid gestationis is an autoimmune blistering disorder that occurs in pregnant women. It is characterized by the development of blisters and bullae on the skin and mucous membranes. The disease is typically self-limited and resolves within a few weeks after delivery. However, it can be severe in some cases and can lead to complications such as fetal loss.

The differential diagnosis for pemphigoid gestationis includes other autoimmune blistering disorders such as bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris. However, these disorders are more common in older adults and are not typically associated with pregnancy.

Treatment for pemphigoid gestationis is with systemic corticosteroids. In severe cases, other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary. The prognosis for pemphigoid gestationis is generally good. However, the disease can be life-threatening in some cases.

X-ray and joint ultrasound results suggested osteoarthritis, synovitis, flexor tendon tenosynovitis, and bone erosions. Ultrasound results also indicated enlarged axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed uveitis.

Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is a major public health problem in many developing countries, where it is estimated that there are 12 million people living with the disease. Leprosy can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to disability and disfigurement.

The diagnosis of leprosy is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and skin biopsy. Treatment for leprosy is effective and can prevent disability. The most common treatment is a combination of two or three drugs, such as dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine. Treatment must be continued for at least six months, and sometimes longer, to prevent the recurrence of the disease.

Title: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a Young Adult Military Veteran Case is: A young man was referred by his Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care provider to the outpatient mental health clinic due to concerns for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He served in the military for 4 years, including a 6-month tour in Iraq. While in Iraq he worked as an assault vehicle operator and was involved in frequent foot patrols. He reported numerous traumatic experiences, including frequent receipt of incoming fire, multiple ambushes, and an explosion by an improvised explosive device (IED) that injured several fellow soldiers (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He denied any psychiatric issues prior to his military service, but reported that since returning home “there ain’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about [these experiences].” The thoughts were highly distressing and he had frequent violent nightmares. He reported intense guilt relating to the belief that he should have detected the IED and been able to protect his colleagues. He reported a number of triggers (eg, walking down a city street; driving by a shooting range) that reminded him of his experiences in Iraq and induced panic-like symptoms (eg, fear, anxiety, racing heart, and feeling shaky). He avoided things that reminded him of these events and was reluctant to discuss his history (see Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1He felt numb and withdrawn from others, reported difficulty sleeping, and was always “on guard.” He startled easily and had angry outbursts. The patient was hopeless at times, but denied suicidal thoughts. He reported difficulty concentrating and had significant fluctuations in his weight. He denied mania, psychosis, or medical problems. He reported drinking more than 12 beers 2 to 3 times per week. He denied any other substance abuse history.The patient was briefly in outpatient treatment while he was still in the military. He was prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) but did not find it helpful and so he discontinued it. He was referred for psychotherapy but did not keep his appointments (see the last sentence of Theme 1, Fear Conditioning, in related Educational Review).1The patient grew up in the suburb of a small city. Though the patient initially described his childhood as “great,” later data revealed a history of early traumatic experiences (see Theme 4, Epigenetic Considerations, in related Educational Review).1What Would You Do Next? A: Trauma-focused psychotherapy , B: Pharmacotherapy with risperidone , C: Pharmacotherapy with prazosin , D: Pharmacotherapy with propranolol. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a number of symptoms consistent with PTSD, including intrusive thoughts and memories, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, negative changes in mood and cognition, and changes in arousal and reactivity. He also has symptoms of depression, including hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, and changes in weight.

The patient's history of early traumatic experiences may have made him more vulnerable to developing PTSD following his experiences in Iraq. His history of substance abuse may also be a complicating factor.

The patient has already tried an SSRI without success, and he has a history of non-adherence to treatment.

Given the patient's presentation, I would recommend a trial of trauma-focused psychotherapy. This type of therapy has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD. It would be important to address the patient's early traumatic experiences as well as his experiences in Iraq.

I would also recommend that the patient start taking a medication to help manage his symptoms. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) would be a good option. These medications have been shown to be effective in treating PTSD.

I would also recommend that the patient receive psychoeducation about PTSD and its treatment. This would help him understand his condition and the treatment options available to him.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman with history of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who is now asymptomatic. She has a surgical history consisting of a Blalock-Taussig shunt in early childhood and subsequent TOF repair at age 3 years. On examination, she has a venous pressure that is visualized 4 cm above the clavicle at 45° with a prominent a wave. A parasternal lift is present. Auscultatory findings at the left upper sternal border are consistent with a systolic ejection murmur. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block. Findings from a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) show a residual ventricular septal defect (VSD), severe pulmonary regurgitation, and an enlarged right ventricle. Right ventricular diastolic volume index, quantitated by cardiac magnetic resonance, is 161 mL/m2.

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot with residual VSD and severe pulmonary regurgitation. The patient's symptoms are likely due to the right ventricular volume overload and pulmonary hypertension that are caused by the VSD and pulmonary regurgitation.

The treatment for tetralogy of Fallot with residual VSD and severe pulmonary regurgitation is surgical repair. The goal of surgery is to close the VSD and relieve the pulmonary regurgitation. The type of surgery that is performed will depend on the size and location of the VSD, the degree of pulmonary regurgitation, and the patient's age and overall health.

In the patient's case, the most appropriate treatment option is surgical repair of the VSD and pulmonary regurgitation. The patient is young and healthy, and the VSD and pulmonary regurgitation are severe enough to cause symptoms. The surgery is likely to be successful in relieving the patient's symptoms and improving her quality of life.

Title: Slowly Growing Right-Sided Neck Mass With Progressive Dysphagia Case is: A man in his late 40s with a 30-pack-year history of smoking and a history of heavy drinking presented following 7 months of right-sided neck tenderness. He also reported progressive dysphagia to solids but no dyspnea, otalgia, or weight loss. Examination revealed very tender right-sided neck fullness of 6 cm. Laryngoscopic findings were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast demonstrated a 4.4 × 3.6 × 4.5-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right side of the neck, splaying and completely surrounding both the internal and external carotid arteries (Figure, A). Scattered lymph nodes were also observed. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the mass was hyperintense on T2 (Figure, B). A second 0.9-cm enhancing mass was visualized at the inferior right jugular foramen. Chest radiography demonstrated no suspicious pulmonary or mediastinal lesions. He underwent excision of the mass with right-sided neck dissection. Cranial nerves XI, X, and XII were identified and preserved. During subadventitial dissection of tumor off the carotid bifurcation, a laceration of the internal carotid artery was noted. Vascular surgery was performed to make an intraoperative repair, and an intraoperative angiogram demonstrated no dissections or thrombi.

The most likely diagnosis is **malignant carotid body tumor**. Carotid body tumors are rare, neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the carotid body, a small structure located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. They are most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 40 and 60, and are more common in men than women. The most common presenting symptom is a painless neck mass. Other symptoms may include headache, facial pain, dysphagia, and Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis).

On imaging, carotid body tumors are typically heterogeneously enhancing masses that splay and completely surround the carotid arteries. They may also involve the jugular vein and cranial nerves.

The treatment of malignant carotid body tumors is surgical resection. This may be followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with malignant carotid body tumors is poor, with a median survival of 2-3 years.

The lesion was suspected to be benign, and the procedure was aborted. The patient experienced no neurologic sequelae postoperatively. A specimen was taken of the right-sided neck mass.

The differential diagnosis for a right-sided neck mass in a patient with a history of smoking and heavy drinking includes atypical carcinoid, malignant carotid body tumor, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and hemangiopericytoma.

Atypical carcinoids are neuroendocrine tumors that typically occur in the lung, but can also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and other organs. They are typically slow-growing tumors that can metastasize to the lymph nodes and other organs.

Malignant carotid body tumors are rare, highly vascular tumors that arise from the carotid body, which is a small structure located at the bifurcation of the carotid artery. They are typically aggressive tumors that can metastasize to the lymph nodes, lungs, and other organs.

Medullary thyroid carcinomas are neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the thyroid gland. They are typically slow-growing tumors that can metastasize to the lymph nodes, lungs, and other organs.

Hemangiopericytomas are rare, vascular tumors that can occur in any part of the body, but are most common in the extremities. They are typically slow-growing tumors that can metastasize to the lymph nodes, lungs, and other organs.

The patient in this case has a history of smoking and heavy drinking, which are risk factors for atypical carcinoid, malignant carotid body tumor, and medullary thyroid carcinoma. The patient also has a right-sided neck mass that is heterogeneously enhancing on CT and hyperintense on T2 on MRI. These findings are consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor, such as atypical carcinoid, malignant carotid body tumor, or medullary thyroid carcinoma. However, the patient's mass was also located at the inferior right jugular foramen, which is a location where hemangiopericytomas can occur.

The patient's mass was excised with right-sided neck dissection. The mass was found to be a neuroendocrine tumor, but the specific subtype was not determined. The patient did not experience any neurologic sequelae postoperatively.

The patient's case is challenging to diagnose because it could represent any of several different types of neuroendocrine tumors. The patient's history of smoking and heavy drinking, as well as the location of his mass, suggest that he may have a malignant tumor. However, the patient's lack of neurologic sequelae postoperatively suggests that his tumor may be benign. The patient's specific subtype of neuroendocrine tumor will need to be determined through further testing.

Vascular surgery was performed to make an intraoperative repair, and an intraoperative angiogram demonstrated no dissections or thrombi. The lesion was suspected to be benign, and the procedure was aborted. The patient experienced no neurologic sequelae postoperatively. A specimen was taken of the right-sided neck mass (Figure, C and D).

The differential diagnosis for a slowly growing right-sided neck mass with progressive dysphagia includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors that can occur in this location include carotid body tumor, paraganglioma, hemangiopericytoma, and schwannoma. Malignant tumors that can occur in this location include metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.

The patient's history of smoking and heavy drinking is a risk factor for the development of malignant tumors, including lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and esophageal cancer. The patient's presentation with a slowly growing neck mass that is tender and associated with progressive dysphagia is concerning for a malignant tumor. The CT scan shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right side of the neck that is splaying and completely surrounding both the internal and external carotid arteries. This is a characteristic appearance of a carotid body tumor. The MRI shows that the mass is hyperintense on T2, which is also a characteristic appearance of a carotid body tumor. The second 0.9-cm enhancing mass at the inferior right jugular foramen is concerning for metastasis.

The patient underwent excision of the mass with right-sided neck dissection. The mass was found to be a carotid body tumor. Carotid body tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the carotid body, which is a small chemoreceptor located at the bifurcation of the carotid artery. Carotid body tumors are more common in men than women, and they typically occur in patients in their 50s or 60s. The most common symptom of a carotid body tumor is a slowly growing neck mass. Other symptoms may include headache, facial pain, and Horner's syndrome. Carotid body tumors are usually diagnosed with CT or MRI imaging. Treatment for a carotid body tumor is surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with carotid body tumors is excellent, with a 5-year survival rate of 95%.

In conclusion, the patient's diagnosis is a carotid body tumor. The patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient underwent successful surgical excision of the tumor, and he is expected to have a good prognosis.

He was born at 37 weeks gestation via cesarean delivery and developed noisy breathing and nasal congestion shortly after birth. Otolaryngological consultation, including fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, was performed, and revealed a right septal deviation. The infant was treated with topical neosynephrine and fluticasone spray and discharged home. On the eighth day of life, the patient returned with noisy breathing, retractions, and poor feeding. Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy revealed a large left inferior turbinate and right septal deviation. On the 12th day of life, he presented with worsening symptoms. Physical examination revealed significant distress, retractions, and cyanosis relieved by crying. A mucosalized mass filling the left nasal cavity was visualized on anterior rhinoscopy, requiring nasal stenting to relieve obstruction. A maxillofacial computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated a 2.0 × 1.6-cm mass in the left mid-nasal cavity, compressing the middle turbinate and lamina papyracea (Figure, A). The cribriform plate was slightly widened prompting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which confirmed a 2-cm heterogeneous mass, isointense on T2 with small hyperintense areas, without intracranial extension (Figure, B). The patient underwent urgent transnasal endoscopic excision of the mass under general anesthesia. The mass was smooth, epithelialized, and pedunculated at the anterior aspect of the face of the left sphenoid sinus and medial to the middle turbinate (Figure, C). Transnasal delivery was performed with a deep margin achieved by resecting the periosteum of the sphenoid (Figure, D).

The most likely diagnosis is nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma. Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas are rare benign tumors that occur in the nasal cavity. They are typically diagnosed in children and young adults. The most common presenting symptom is nasal obstruction. Other symptoms may include epistaxis, headache, and facial pain. Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas are often diagnosed on imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. The treatment of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas is surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas is excellent.

Title: Retropharyngeal Mass Case is: A woman in her 30s with no significant medical history presented with progressive sore throat, globus sensation, and dysphagia. She was prescribed multiple rounds of antibiotics without notable improvement. Physical examination revealed a submucosal right retropharyngeal mass extending from the level of the soft palate to the postcricoid. Cranial nerve function and neck range of motion were normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 4 × 3 × 3-cm right retropharyngeal mass with narrowing of the pharyngeal airway, subtle permeative destruction and cortical breakthrough of the C2 vertebral body. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed a T2 hyperintense, enhancing mass in the retropharyngeal and prevertebral spaces with marrow replacement of the C2 vertebral body extending to the odontoid (Figure, A). The patient underwent a combined otolaryngology-neurosurgical procedure with a transoral approach via an inferiorly based myomucosal flap to C1-C3 with microsurgical resection of C2 tumor and corpectomy, placement of the halo device, tracheotomy, and staged interval occiput-C6 posterior spinal fusion (Figure, B). Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was decannulated prior to hospital discharge. Histopathologic findings showed sheets and cords of tumor cells with eosinophilic granular, clear, or bubbly cytoplasm on a basophilic myxoid stromal background (Figure, C), and scattered physaliphorous cells were also noted. Results from immunohistochemical analysis were positive for brachyury (Figure, D).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Results from immunohistochemical analysis were positive for brachyury.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is chordoma. Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors that arise from remnants of the notochord. They are most commonly found in the sacrococcygeal region, but can also occur in the skull base, clivus, and spine. Chordomas are typically locally invasive and can spread to the lungs, liver, and bone. The treatment for chordoma is surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with chordoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%.

Title: Unilateral Neck Swelling in a Pediatric Patient Case is: A 2-year-old boy presented with his parents for evaluation of unilateral neck swelling that had persisted for 4 months. Examination revealed a firm, immobile, and nontender mass affixed to the underlying right mandible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 3.7 × 3.6 × 2.6-cm mass arising from the medial aspect of the right mandibular body with cortical destruction (Figure, A-C). The mass extended into the submandibular and sublingual spaces. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lesion isointense to muscle on T1 sequence, heterogeneously hyperintense with internal foci of decreased intensity on T2 sequence (Figure, D), and homogeneous contrast enhancement. Results from staging studies, including a bone survey, were negative for metastatic disease. Core biopsy revealed spindle cell proliferation with abundant intervening collagen but no anaplasia, mitotic activity, eosinophils, or inflammatory components. Incisional biopsy showed fibroblastic proliferation comprised of slender, uniform spindle cells arranged in fascicles with intervening collagenous stroma and no mitoses. Results from immunohistochemical analysis were positive for β-catenin and negative for CD34, desmin, and smooth muscle actin. No clonal abnormalities were present. The patient was negative for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) mutations on genetic testing. Chemotherapy with hydroxyurea, 20 mg/kg/d, was initiated and continued for 2 years. Reconstructive surgery was considered but not pursued given the lesion size. The most recent interval MRI, performed 4 years after initial presentation, showed a decrease in the size of the mass to 1.5 cm in the maximum dimension.A and B, T1 precontrast fat-saturated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating a mass (arrowhead) arising from right aspect of the mandible.

A: Ewing sarcoma , B: Eosinophilic granuloma , C: Desmoid tumor , D: Lymphoma. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a 4-month history of unilateral neck swelling. The mass is firm, immobile, and nontender, and it is affixed to the underlying mandible. This suggests that the mass is a soft tissue tumor. The MRI shows a 3.7 × 3.6 × 2.6-cm mass arising from the medial aspect of the right mandibular body with cortical destruction. The mass extends into the submandibular and sublingual spaces. The MRI demonstrates a lesion isointense to muscle on T1 sequence, heterogeneously hyperintense with internal foci of decreased intensity on T2 sequence, and homogeneous contrast enhancement. These findings are consistent with a desmoid tumor.

Desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive mesenchymal tumors that arise from fibroblasts. They are most common in the abdominal wall, but they can occur in any location, including the head and neck. Desmoid tumors are typically slow-growing and rarely metastasize. However, they can be locally invasive and destructive, and they can recur after treatment.

The treatment of desmoid tumors is based on the location of the tumor, the size of the tumor, and the patient's age and overall health. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, but it is often not possible to achieve a complete resection due to the tumor's location or invasiveness. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor prior to surgery or to treat tumors that are not amenable to surgery.

In this case, the patient was treated with hydroxyurea, a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat desmoid tumors. The patient's response to treatment was good, with a decrease in the size of the mass. The patient will continue to be monitored closely for recurrence of the tumor.

Answer:

The answer is C. Desmoid tumor.

Title: Recent Onset of Bilateral Ptosis Case is: A Hispanic man in his late 50s presented with gradual progression of bilateral blepharoptosis for 6 months (Figure), starting in the left eye and subsequently involving the right eye. The ptosis did not worsen or fluctuate throughout the day. He had a strong family history of bilateral ptosis, which included his father, grandfather, uncles, cousins, and 4 of his siblings (he had a total of 13 siblings [7 brothers and 6 sisters]). None of his children or his siblings’ children were affected (the oldest being 31 years of age). He had no history of trauma, crossing or drifting of the eyes, dysarthria, dyspnea, or diplopia. He had noticed mild lightheadedness and trouble swallowing. His medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension.External photograph showing bilateral blepharoptosis with dermatochalasis. Notice the chin-up head position that the patient has to maintain to look in the primary gaze.His visual acuity was 20/25 OU with an intraocular pressure of 11 mm Hg OU. He had a mild decrease in elevation and abduction in both eyes on extraocular motility testing. Pupil reactivity and confrontational visual fields were normal. The results of anterior and posterior segment examinations were normal. The margin to reflex distance was −1 mm OD and −3 mm OS. Levator function was 4 mm OD and 3 mm OS with normal orbicularis function. No lagophthalmos was noted. Goldmann perimetry showed a 30° improvement in the right eye and a 50° improvement in the left eye, with taping of the upper eyelids.What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with congenital ptosis, which is a common inherited condition. The presence of a strong family history is particularly suggestive of this diagnosis. Congenital ptosis is typically caused by a deficiency of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is responsible for elevating the upper eyelid. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the margin to reflex distance (MRD), which is the distance between the upper eyelid margin and the corneal light reflex. A MRD of less than 2 mm is considered abnormal. In this case, the patient's MRD was -1 mm in the right eye and -3 mm in the left eye, which is consistent with ptosis.

Treatment: The treatment for congenital ptosis is surgical repair. This can be performed by a variety of techniques, including Müllerectomy, levator advancement, or a combination of the two. The goal of surgery is to elevate the upper eyelid so that the patient has a normal field of vision and does not experience any cosmetic problems.

Title: Headaches and Blurry Vision Case is: A Caucasian male in his 40s was referred by his primary care doctor for evaluation after experiencing blurry vision associated with frontal headaches for a week. Despite his headaches, he denied having eye pain. He was otherwise healthy, with no past medical or ocular history. Prior to referral, his symptoms prompted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, orbits, and cervical spine which were unremarkable. Laboratory test results for the presence of Lyme disease, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzymes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were normal.The best corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye. Motility, intraocular pressures, and pupillary light reflexes were normal. The anterior segment examination results were normal, and the lenses were clear bilaterally. A fundus examination showed vitreous cells in both eyes, but the optic nerve and retinal vessels were visualized clearly. Also, both eyes had optic nerve hyperemia and multiple shallow serous retinal detachments. The fluorescein angiography of both eyes demonstrated optic disc leakage, multiple pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence, and fluorescein pooling in the areas of serous detachment (Figure).Start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taperWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning:
The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are consistent with a diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause sudden vision loss. It is most commonly associated with multiple sclerosis, but it can also be caused by other conditions, such as infections, tumors, and autoimmune disorders.

The treatment of optic neuritis typically involves the use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. In most cases, vision will improve within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, some people may experience permanent vision loss.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the best course of action is to start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper. This will help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of complications, such as increased intraocular pressure.

Title: Bilateral Retinal Hemorrhages in a Young Man Case is: A man in his 30s was referred to the retina clinic with a diagnosis of bilateral branch retinal vein occlusions. He reported flashes and progressive blurry vision in both eyes over a period of 6 days. He had no history of eye problems. His medical history was negative for diabetes and hypertension, and review of systems was positive for recent easy bruising and progressive fatigue. His initial best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/50 OS. Results from examination of his pupils, motility, intraocular pressures, confrontational visual fields, and anterior segments were normal. A dilated fundus examination was conducted (Figure). He had bilateral flame-shaped and intraretinal hemorrhages in both maculae along the superior arcades and some scattered peripheral hemorrhages. There was no vessel tortuosity, and there were hard exudates in the left macula. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed areas of hyperreflectivity in the middle and outer retina. Fluorescein angiography of both eyes showed blocking in the areas of hemorrhage, good venous filling, no leakage, and no neovascularization.Wide-field scanning laser image of the left eye showed superficial and intraretinal hemorrhages and hard exudates.What Would You Do Next?

Title: White Vitreous Deposits After Subtenon Steroid Injection:  More Than Meets the Eye Case is: A 58-year-old woman returned from the Ukraine with 3 months of constant blurry vision in the left eye. Her history was significant for glaucoma and breast cancer with brain metastasis treated with CyberKnife and whole-brain radiation. While abroad, she received 2 inferiorly placed periocular steroid injections and was treated with glaucoma drops for elevated pressures of 55 mm Hg. At presentation, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS, and intraocular pressures were 18 and 20 mm Hg, respectively. She had a left afferent pupillary defect and left superior visual field deficit. Slitlamp examination of the right eye was unremarkable, while the left eye showed 1+ cell in the anterior chamber and 1+ nuclear sclerosis with pigment on the anterior lens capsule. Posterior examination revealed 2+ whitish vitreous deposits, a cup-disc ratio of 0.8, and inferior retinal detachment with subretinal particulate material (Figure, A). B-scan showed vitreous, subhyaloid, and subretinal opacities without choroidal involvement (Figure, B). A magnetic resonance image of the brain and orbits did not reveal any new metastatic lesions.A, Whitish vitreous deposits, inferior retinal detachment, and subretinal material seen on fundus photography of the left eye.

B-scan showed vitreous, subhyaloid, and subretinal opacities without choroidal involvement. A magnetic resonance image of the brain and orbits did not reveal any new metastatic lesions.

The most likely diagnosis is a sterile vitritis secondary to the periocular steroid injections. The patient's history of breast cancer with brain metastasis and the presence of subretinal particulate material on fundus examination are suggestive of this diagnosis. The white vitreous deposits are likely due to inflammation and debris in the vitreous humor. The inferior retinal detachment is likely due to traction from the subretinal particulate material.

The treatment for a sterile vitritis is typically observation and management of the underlying condition. In this case, the patient's breast cancer is being treated with systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient's glaucoma is being treated with topical medications. The patient should be monitored for progression of the retinal detachment. If the retinal detachment progresses, a vitrectomy may be necessary to remove the subretinal particulate material and repair the retinal detachment.

In this case, the most appropriate management is to observe and manage the patient's glaucoma. The patient's breast cancer is being treated with systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient's retinal detachment is being monitored. If the retinal detachment progresses, a vitrectomy may be necessary to remove the subretinal particulate material and repair the retinal detachment.

Reasoning:

The patient's history of breast cancer with brain metastasis and the presence of subretinal particulate material on fundus examination are suggestive of a sterile vitritis secondary to the periocular steroid injections.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a previously healthy man in his 50s with a 20-day history of right upper abdominal pain, high-grade fever, and chills. There is no history of trauma or alcohol intake. Clinical examination reveals no icterus or significant lymphadenopathy. There is guarding and tenderness in the right upper quadrant; the liver is firm, smooth, and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory investigations are remarkable for white blood cell counts of 13 200/μL and alkaline phosphatase of 259 U/L. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a large hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver along with gallstones. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan was performed, which showed a large hypodense area measuring 16 × 11.8 × 12.4 cm, involving segments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, along with a gallstone. The gallbladder fundus is seen just caudal to this hypodense area.

The most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder. This is supported by the patient's history, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. The white blood cell count is elevated, which is a sign of inflammation. The alkaline phosphatase is elevated, which is a sign of liver damage. The ultrasonography shows a large hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver, which is consistent with a gallstone. The CECT scan shows a large hypodense area measuring 16 × 11.8 × 12.4 cm, involving segments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, along with a gallstone. This is consistent with a perforated gallbladder.

The differential diagnosis includes liver abscess, gallbladder cancer with contiguous liver infiltration, and necrotic liver tumor. Liver abscess is a collection of pus in the liver. Gallbladder cancer is a malignant tumor of the gallbladder. Necrotic liver tumor is a tumor of the liver that has undergone necrosis. These conditions can all present with similar symptoms, but the imaging studies in this case are most consistent with acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.

She had good exercise tolerance, and the results of cardiopulmonary investigations, as a part of preanesthesia workup, were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is a cecal diverticulum. Cecal diverticula are the most common type of colonic diverticulum, accounting for approximately 70% of all colonic diverticula. They are typically acquired lesions that occur as a result of increased intraluminal pressure, which can be caused by chronic constipation, straining at stool, and a low-fiber diet. Cecal diverticula are usually asymptomatic, but they can become inflamed or infected, leading to diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a common condition, affecting approximately 20% of adults in the United States. It is more common in older adults, and it is more common in men than women. The most common symptoms of diverticulitis are abdominal pain, fever, and nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, diverticulitis can lead to perforation of the colon, peritonitis, and sepsis.

The diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and assessing the extent of the disease. Treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis is usually conservative, with antibiotics and bowel rest. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to drain an abscess or repair a perforation.

The prognosis for patients with cecal diverticulitis is generally good. However, the condition can be recurrent, and it can lead to complications such as perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.

Title: Large Epigastric Cystic Lesion in a Pregnant Woman Case is: A primigravid woman in her 20s who had been pregnant for 16 weeks presented with significant abdominal pain. A noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 15 × 13 × 11-cm heterogeneous cystic mass that appeared to originate from the body of the pancreas and protrude into the gastric wall (Figure 1, A). Results of CT scan also revealed a 3-cm hypodense lesion on the left lobe of the liver, ascites, and splenomegaly. Further evaluation with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed extrinsic compression of the gastric wall from a large mixed solid/cystic lesion with septations and well-defined margins with no clear involvement of the gastric wall. A thin, reddish-brown fluid (700 mL) was aspirated from the cystic component. Analysis of the aspirate showed no tumor cells or mucinous material, and normal carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, and amylase. Fine-needle aspiration was performed on the solid component of the cystic tumor (Figure 1, B-E).A, Coronal view CT scan showing a 15 × 13 × 11-cm complex heterogeneous mass originating from the body of the pancreas (white arrowhead) and protruding into the gastric wall.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a primigravid woman in her 20s who had been pregnant for 16 weeks and presented with significant abdominal pain. A noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 15 × 13 × 11-cm heterogeneous cystic mass that appeared to originate from the body of the pancreas and protrude into the gastric wall. Results of CT scan also revealed a 3-cm hypodense lesion on the left lobe of the liver, ascites, and splenomegaly. Further evaluation with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed extrinsic compression of the gastric wall from a large mixed solid/cystic lesion with septations and well-defined margins with no clear involvement of the gastric wall. A thin, reddish-brown fluid (700 mL) was aspirated from the cystic component. Analysis of the aspirate showed no tumor cells or mucinous material, and normal carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, and amylase. Fine-needle aspiration was performed on the solid component of the cystic tumor (Figure 1, B-E).

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas (SPNET). SPNET is a rare, benign tumor of the pancreas that typically presents in young women. It is characterized by a cystic component with a solid component that is composed of spindle cells with a pseudopapillary architecture. SPNETs are typically not associated with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CA19-9 levels. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is often used to make the diagnosis, and the tumor cells typically show positive staining for α-smooth muscle actin and CD117.

The differential diagnosis for a large cystic lesion in the pancreas includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors, as well as pseudocysts. Benign tumors that can present as a cystic lesion in the pancreas include SPNET, mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Malignant tumors that can present as a cystic lesion in the pancreas include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Pseudocysts are fluid-filled collections that can form in the pancreas after pancreatitis.

The treatment of SPNET is surgical excision. The tumor is typically well-demarcated and can be easily removed with minimal pancreatic parenchymal resection. The prognosis for patients with SPNET is excellent, with a 5-year survival rate of 95%.

Title: A Tender Rash on the Hand Case is: A healthy 36-year-old man was referred to the dermatology clinic for a 5-day history of an exquisitely tender rash at the base of his left thumb. One day prior to presentation, he went to a local emergency department, where he was prescribed clindamycin and valacyclovir. The patient works as a plumber and attributed his tender rash to a “spider bite” he had incurred while working in an old building. The patient was afebrile, and physical examination revealed several vesicles with purulent fluid on an erythematous base, at the base of the left thumb (Figure). There was no lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or mucous membrane involvement. The rash was not found elsewhere on the body. Vesicular fluid was collected and sent for further analysis.Admit to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapyInstruct the patient to take only the valacyclovirInstruct the patient to take only the clindamycinWhat Would You Do Next?

There was no lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or mucous membrane involvement. The rash was not found elsewhere on the body. Vesicular fluid was collected and sent for further analysis.

The differential diagnosis for a tender rash on the hand includes:

* Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection
* Bacterial infection (e.g., cellulitis)
* Spider bite
* Contact dermatitis
* Psoriasis

The most likely diagnosis in this case is HSV infection. This is supported by the patient's history of a “spider bite” (which is a common history in patients with HSV infection), the presence of vesicles with purulent fluid, and the lack of lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or mucous membrane involvement.

The treatment for HSV infection is oral antiviral therapy with valacyclovir or acyclovir. The patient in this case was already prescribed valacyclovir, so I would instruct him to continue taking that medication as prescribed. I would also recommend that he keep the area clean and dry, and avoid scratching the rash.

Title: Increasing Hypoxemia and Dyspnea in Mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Case is: A man with a 3-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion, requiring increasing flow rates of oxygen. He was a former smoker with a 50–pack-year history. He had been diagnosed with stage I low-grade prostate cancer several years previously.Lung examination showed no wheezing. Cardiac examination showed a prominent pulmonary component (P2) of the second heart sound. Noncontrast computed tomography of the chest was unremarkable.An echocardiogram revealed dilated right atrium and ventricle. Spirometry showed mild airway obstruction. Duplex ultrasound showed a nonocclusive thrombus in the left femoral and popliteal veins. Catheterization of the right side of the heart showed a pulmonary arterial pressure of 79/32 mm Hg (mean, 48 mm Hg) with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a 3-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion, requiring increasing flow rates of oxygen. He was a former smoker with a 50-pack-year history. He had been diagnosed with stage I low-grade prostate cancer several years previously.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE). The V/Q scan shows multiple mismatched perfusion defects, which is suggestive of PE. The pulmonary angiography confirms the diagnosis of PE.

The treatment for PE is anticoagulation with either heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by warfarin for 6 months. In patients with massive PE or hemodynamic instability, surgical embolectomy may be necessary.

In this patient, the PE is small and non-massive, so anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH followed by warfarin for 6 months is the appropriate treatment. There is no indication for surgical embolectomy or pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

Title: Bullae and Erosions on Sun-Exposed Skin Case is: A man in his 60s presented with new-onset bullae and erosions over sun-exposed areas and bony prominences. His medical history was relevant for acute myeloid leukemia, for which he had received an allogeneic stem cell transplant that was complicated by biopsy-proven grade 3 cutaneous and grade 2 gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease. As part of his posttransplant infectious prophylaxis, the patient had been prescribed valacyclovir hydrochloride, voriconazole, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. He was also taking tacrolimus hydrate and prednisone for treatment of his graft-vs-host disease. The patient reported fishing outdoors on a sunny day a few days prior to the onset of these skin lesions. On physical examination, the patient’s skin was diffusely tan and there were flaccid bullae and erosions on the bilateral dorsal hands, elbows, and knees (Figure, A). A punch biopsy specimen from a bulla from the upper extremity was obtained (Figure, B).A, Flaccid bulla and erosions on the left dorsal hand at presentation.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is an African American male in his 50s with a longstanding history of atopic dermatitis. He presents with a 20- to 30-year medical history of occasionally pruritic erythematous papules involving the trunk and extremities. He denies associated fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, cough, difficulty breathing, or chest pain.

The physical examination reveals red-brown monomorphic papules coalescing into plaques on the face, trunk, and extremities. There are thin erythematous plaques with overlying scale on bilateral extensor upper and lower extremities. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen from his right upper extremity was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathologic analysis. Periodic acid–Schiff and acid-fast bacilli stains were also performed.

The histopathologic findings show a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional multinucleated giant cells. The periodic acid–Schiff and acid-fast bacilli stains are negative.

The differential diagnosis includes disseminated granuloma annulare, erythrodermic sarcoidosis, mycosis fungoides, and tuberculid.

Disseminated granuloma annulare is a chronic skin disease characterized by the formation of small, red or brown papules that often coalesce into rings or arcs. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities, and they may be pruritic. The histopathologic findings of disseminated granuloma annulare show a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional multinucleated giant cells.

Erythrodermic sarcoidosis is a rare form of sarcoidosis that is characterized by widespread inflammation of the skin. The lesions are typically red, scaling, and confluent, and they may be associated with fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The histopathologic findings of erythrodermic sarcoidosis show a non-caseating granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis.

Mycosis fungoides is a rare type of T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques of eczema-like skin lesions. The lesions may be pruritic, and they may eventually progress to form tumors. The histopathologic findings of mycosis fungoides show a clonal proliferation of T-cells in the skin.

Tuberculid is a group of skin diseases that are caused by an infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The lesions are typically red, scaling, and confluent, and they may be associated with fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The histopathologic findings of tuberculid show a non-caseating granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis.

Based on the history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated granuloma annulare.

Title: Painful Papulonodule on the Foot of a Patient With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Case is: A man in his 50s with diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, and latent tuberculosis presented with a slow-growing nodule on the left foot. The lesion started 1 year prior as a tender red nodule on the medial aspect of his first metatarsophalangeal joint, which would enlarge and become painful approximately once a month (Figure, A). The patient reported that with manipulation, a clear-to-yellow material drained from the lesion. The patient denied any purulent drainage, additional skin lesions, fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms. His medications included efavirenz–emtricitabine–tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for his HIV, with the most recent absolute CD4-positive cell count of 341 cells/mm3 (reference range, 263-2045 cells/mm3), and recent completion of an 8-month course of isoniazid treatment after being exposed to tuberculosis.

Physical examination demonstrated an erythematous papulonodule without warmth or drainage on the dorsal left great toe. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. A punch biopsy was performed to help establish the diagnosis.

The biopsy showed acral skin with acute and chronic inflammation within the deep dermis. Higher magnification highlighted eosinophilic material surrounding small cocci. Gram staining of the biopsy supported the diagnosis.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous tuberculosis. Cutaneous tuberculosis is a common manifestation of systemic tuberculosis, particularly in patients with HIV infection. The most common presentation is a papulonodule that slowly enlarges over time. The lesion may be painful, and it may drain a clear or yellow fluid. Cutaneous tuberculosis is diagnosed with a biopsy that shows granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast bacilli on staining.

The differential diagnosis for cutaneous tuberculosis includes botryomycosis, digital mucous cyst, and foreign-body reaction. Botryomycosis is a rare infection caused by Actinomyces species. It typically presents as a single, painful nodule that drains a purulent fluid. Digital mucous cyst is a benign condition that is caused by obstruction of a mucous gland. It typically presents as a small, painless nodule on the finger or toe. Foreign-body reaction is a common reaction to a foreign body in the skin. It typically presents as a small, red, painful nodule.

The treatment for cutaneous tuberculosis is isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. These medications are typically given for 6-9 months. The patient should also be treated for any underlying HIV infection.

Title: Improved Muscular Weakness During Asthma Exacerbation Case is: A 48-year-old man attended the outpatient clinic for muscular weakness and restricted ability to walk, which had slowly increased since infancy. Medical history revealed muscle weakness noticeable since birth, but normal cognitive development. He first walked at age 18 months, but always had a waddling gait and hyperlordosis. The patient was examined at 3 neuromuscular centers. Electromyography (EMG), creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle tomodensitometry, and 3 muscle biopsies were normal. Results for acetylcholinesterase antibodies were negative. At age 48 years, the patient had increasing axial and proximal weakness, hyperlordosis (Figure, A), and difficulties rising from the floor. He was only able to walk 181 m in a 6-minute walking test. Peripheral facial weakness and bilateral eyelid ptosis were prominent. Clinical history also included asthma with several episodes of decompensation. During these episodes, the patient received oral albuterol, 2.5 mg every 6 hours, and inhaled steroids, 250 µg twice a day. Surprisingly, during an asthma attack, the patient was able to climb the stairs, rise from the floor, and walk several kilometers. His neuromuscular condition resumed to the initial level of weakness some weeks after the asthma attack.Clinical features before and after salbutamol treatment.

Surprisingly, during an asthma attack, the patient was able to climb the stairs, rise from the floor, and walk several kilometers. His neuromuscular condition resumed to the initial level of weakness some weeks after the asthma attack.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with **Becker muscular dystrophy** (BMD). BMD is a form of muscular dystrophy caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. The dystrophin protein is essential for the structural integrity of muscle fibers, and its absence or dysfunction leads to muscle weakness. The symptoms of BMD typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood, and they progress slowly over time. The most common symptoms are muscle weakness in the legs, hips, and shoulders. Other symptoms may include fatigue, difficulty walking, and respiratory problems. There is no cure for BMD, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. Treatment options include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medications to improve muscle strength and endurance.

The patient's improvement during an asthma attack is likely due to the bronchodilatory effects of albuterol. Albuterol is a medication that relaxes the muscles in the airways, which can help to improve breathing. It is possible that albuterol also has a direct effect on muscle fibers, which could explain the patient's improvement in muscle strength.

The patient's EMG, creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle tomodensitometry, and muscle biopsies were all normal, which makes it unlikely that he has Pompe disease, spinal muscular atrophy, or seronegative myasthenia gravis.

**Answer:** The patient's diagnosis is **Becker muscular dystrophy** (BMD).
Answer not found by re
Answer not available
Reasoning:

The patient's history of slowly progressive muscular weakness since infancy, normal cognitive development, and waddling gait and hyperlordosis are all consistent with a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a genetic disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. This leads to progressive muscle weakness, which can eventually affect the muscles used for breathing and swallowing.

The patient's EMG, creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle tomodensitometry, and 3 muscle biopsies were all normal. This is consistent with the diagnosis of SMA, as these tests are typically normal in patients with this condition.

The patient's results for acetylcholinesterase antibodies were negative. This is also consistent with the diagnosis of SMA, as these antibodies are typically present in patients with myasthenia gravis.

The patient's clinical history also included asthma with several episodes of decompensation. During these episodes, the patient received oral albuterol, 2.5 mg every 6 hours, and inhaled steroids, 250 µg twice a day. Surprisingly, during an asthma attack, the patient was able to climb the stairs, rise from the floor, and walk several kilometers. His neuromuscular condition resumed to the initial level of weakness some weeks after the asthma attack.

This is an unusual finding, but it is consistent with the diagnosis of SMA. In some cases, patients with SMA may experience a temporary improvement in their muscle strength during an asthma attack. This is thought to be due to the release of epinephrine, a hormone that can increase muscle strength.

Answer:

The correct answer is B: Spinal muscular atrophy.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of SMA. The patient's temporary improvement in muscle strength during an asthma attack is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Title: Teenager With Hip Pain and Limp Case is: A 13-year-old girl presented to an emergency department with bilateral hip pain for several months and acute worsening with left-sided limp following a school field trip to a large museum. She stated that her pain worsened with walking and was minimally relieved with salicylic acid. Her parents tried to schedule an outpatient appointment for evaluation of her hip pain but had difficulty owing to a lack of a primary care physician. Review of systems was significant for heavy periods since menarche 6 months ago. It was negative for easy bruising or bleeding. The patient described normal stooling and voiding habits. The patient was described as a shy eighth grader who earns A’s and B’s in school. She was not physically active. On physical examination, the patient was noted to be short for her age (1.3 m [4.4 ft]; height in <third percentile), weight (62.5 kg; 87th percentile), and body mass index (35 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]; 99th percentile). She had a relatively short, thick neck with acanthosis nigricans, dry skin, Tanner stage II breasts, and nonpitting edema of her hands (Figure 1A). Her family history was significant for hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease in the father, type 2 diabetes mellitus in the maternal great grandmother, and hypothyroidism in the maternal grandmother.

Title: A Woman in Emotional Distress With Chest Pain Case is: A woman in her late 50s with a history of multiple sclerosis, without traditional atherosclerosis risk factors and not taking medications, presented to the emergency department after having 30 minutes of pain in her left shoulder and vague chest pressure that had already resolved. There were no associated symptoms. Her daughter had died unexpectedly a few days before presentation, and the burial service was scheduled for that day. Except for the patient appearing struck with severe grief, the results of an initial physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and radiography of the chest and her initial laboratory results were all unremarkable. Her serial troponin T levels were less than 0.01, 0.04, and 0.1 ng/mL (normal range, <0.01 ng/mL [to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0]). An emergency transthoracic echocardiographic biplane volumetric assessment of left ventricular (LV) function is shown in Figure 1 (Video 1 and Video 2). She received aspirin, high-intensity statin, and low-dose β-blocker and was given a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin subcutaneously. Serial ECGs were unchanged, and the patient was completely asymptomatic; thus, she was permitted to briefly attend her daughter’s burial service as long as she returned immediately for direct hospital admission. Twelve hours after readmission, she was asymptomatic, her troponin level had increased to 2.0 ng/mL, and she again underwent ECG (Figure 1).Transthoracic echo biplane volumetric left ventricular function assessment (A-E).

Reasoning: The patient's history and presentation are consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a stress-induced cardiomyopathy that can present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for diagnosing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as it can show the characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle. Echocardiography can also be helpful in diagnosing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, but it is not as sensitive as MRI. Coronary angiography is not necessary to diagnose Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as it is a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) is a newer imaging modality that can be used to diagnose coronary artery disease. However, it is not as sensitive as MRI for diagnosing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Title: A Young Man With Enlarging Unilateral Tonsil Mass Case is: A young man in his late teens presented to a pediatric otolaryngologist for evaluation of enlarged tonsils and recurrent tonsillitis. The patient reported 2 episodes of streptococcal tonsillitis and infectious mononucleosis over the past 8 months, as well as frequent throat soreness and associated difficulty swallowing throughout the past year. Results from a review of systems were negative for weight loss, fevers, and malaise. On physical examination, he appeared well and had 2+ cryptic tonsils. A lobular mass was noted to be extending from the inferior pole of the right tonsil. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient was scheduled for tonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar asymmetry. His surgery was delayed for several months to accommodate his college schedule. In the operating room, the tonsils were noted to be 3+ bilaterally. The right tonsil had a smooth, pedunculated, flesh-colored mass extending inferiorly. The mass had enlarged since the prior examination. Both tonsils were removed without complication. The right tonsil with the attached mass was submitted to the pathology service fresh to allow evaluation by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry revealed no lymphoid abnormality. Grossly, the polypoid oval mass measured 2 × 1 × 1 cm, weighed 8.7 g, and had a narrow 0.4-cm-long stalk connecting it to the tonsil (Figure, A). Histologic sections revealed a polypoid structure composed of a fibrovascular core covered by stratified squamous epithelium (Figure, B). A subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue was noted (Figure, C) as well as lymphatic channels accentuated by D2-40 antibody (Figure, D). No cellular atypia was identified.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The most likely diagnosis is a lymphangiomatous polyp. Lymphangiomatous polyps are benign tumors that arise from lymphatic tissue. They are most common in children and young adults. The typical presentation is a painless, pedunculated mass on the tonsil. Lymphangiomatous polyps can be diagnosed on clinical grounds, but biopsy is often performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes, such as a juvenile angiofibroma. Treatment is typically surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent.

Title: Protruding Glistening Mass on the Posterior Surface of the Auricle Case is: A man in his 50s presented with a 5-year history of a slow-growing mass on the posterior surface of the left auricle. He denied any history of trauma or surgery around the ear, and reported only a cosmetic problem without pain or discharge. His medical history was positive for hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hyperthyroidism, and negative for unusual skin pigmentation or cardiac problems. A laboratory examination revealed only slightly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (4.80 µU/mL). A physical examination showed a solitary, 1-cm, dome-shaped, glistening, flesh-colored mass adherent to the posterior groove of the concha ridge (Figure, A and B). There were no abnormal pigmented skin lesions on the rest of his body, including the face, trunk, and extremities. Neither a palpable thyroid nodule nor enlargement of hands and feet was identified. Surgical excision was performed. Gross total extirpation of the mass from the surrounding tissues was enabled by meticulous dissection. Intraoperatively, the 1-cm mass was noted to be gelatinous and glossy with well-demarcated and smooth border. It was attached to the posterior surface of the concha cartilage but easily separated using blunt dissection. Unexpectedly, low-viscosity mucoid fluid had smeared on the surface. The histopathological examination revealed the tumor to be overall hypocellular and composed of bland spindle cells with no mitotic activity in a slightly basophilic myxoid matrix (Figure, C). The surgical wound uneventfully healed, and no recurrence was noted during the 6-month follow-up period.A, Photograph of a protruding mass on the posterior surface of the auricle. B, A preoperative close-up of the solitary lesion. C, Histopathological image showing overall hypocellular stroma with scattered bland spindle cells in slightly basophilic myxoid matrix without mitotic activity.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is solitary cutaneous myxoma. This is a benign tumor that is composed of myxoid connective tissue. It is most commonly found in the head and neck region, and can occur at any age. The lesion is typically slow-growing and painless, and may be asymptomatic or present with a cosmetic concern. On physical examination, it is a solitary, dome-shaped, glistening, flesh-colored mass. Histopathologically, it is composed of bland spindle cells in a slightly basophilic myxoid matrix. There is no mitotic activity or necrosis. Treatment is surgical excision, and the prognosis is excellent.

Answer:
D. Solitary cutaneous myxoma

Title: A Young Man With Hypercalcemia Case is: A well-developed man in his 20s presented to our hospital with a clinically significant elevation in serum calcium level to (14.1 mg/dL [reference range, 8.6-10.2 mg/dL]) found on routine laboratory tests. He was highly functional and denied abdominal pain, dysuria, anxiety, lethargy, and constipation. Findings from his physical examination were within normal limits. He did not have any palpable thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy. Given his elevated calcium level, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was drawn, and results returned significantly elevated at 1377 pg/mL (reference range, 10-65 pg/mL). Because of the extremely elevated PTH level, a technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan was obtained, which identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, measured at 2.2 cm (Figure, A). In addition, CT showed associated lytic bone lesions of the left mandibular ramus, left scapula, and C5 vertebra (Figure, B).Preoperative imaging of the neck.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is a young man with a clinically significant elevation in serum calcium level to 14.1 mg/dL. He is highly functional and denies abdominal pain, dysuria, anxiety, lethargy, and constipation. Findings from his physical examination were within normal limits. He did not have any palpable thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy. Given his elevated calcium level, parathyroid hormone (PTH) was drawn, and results returned significantly elevated at 1377 pg/mL. Because of the extremely elevated PTH level, a technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan was obtained, which identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, measured at 2.2 cm. In addition, CT showed associated lytic bone lesions of the left mandibular ramus, left scapula, and C5 vertebra.

The most likely diagnosis is parathyroid adenoma. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by an elevated serum calcium level due to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. The elevated PTH level in this patient is likely due to a parathyroid adenoma that is secreting excessive amounts of PTH. The lytic bone lesions on the CT scan are consistent with the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.

Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. It is not a likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any of the typical symptoms of multiple myeloma, such as bone pain, fatigue, anemia, and renal failure.

Primary bone tumors are a group of tumors that arise from the bones. They are not a likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any of the typical symptoms of primary bone tumors, such as bone pain, swelling, and tenderness.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a bone disorder that is characterized by the formation of fibrous tissue and cysts in the bones. It is not a likely diagnosis in this patient because he does not have any of the typical symptoms of osteitis fibrosa cystica, such as bone pain, weakness, and fractures.

**Answer:**

The diagnosis is parathyroid adenoma.

Answer not available
Reasoning:
The patient is a young man with a clinically significant elevation in serum calcium level (14.1 mg/dL) and a significantly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (1377 pg/mL). These findings are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the general population.

The technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan shows a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, which is a characteristic finding in primary hyperparathyroidism.

The CT scan shows associated lytic bone lesions of the left mandibular ramus, left scapula, and C5 vertebra. These findings are also consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, as hyperparathyroidism can lead to bone demineralization and fractures.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary hyperparathyroidism.

Title: A Young Boy With Progressive Dysphonia Case is: A young boy referred by his local otolaryngologist presented with dysphonia and abnormal laryngeal examination results. His voice quality had always been husky, with recent mild exacerbation. No stridor or shortness of breath was reported, but he admittedly “hated to run” and was relatively sedentary. His parents noted intermittent stertor while he was sleeping but no apnea. He had no dysphagia or aspiration manifestations. He was overweight (body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, 27.2); breathed comfortably at rest; and had a dysphonic, breathy voice. Findings from an otolaryngologic examination were normal other than those from flexible laryngoscopy, which demonstrated 2 laryngeal lesions, 1 in the postcricoid interarytenoid region and 1 at the anterior commissure, the latter of which compromised vocal fold approximation. Vocal fold mobility otherwise appeared normal. Operative laryngoscopy confirmed a midline, firm, posterior cricoid mass (Figure, A), and a midline, firm, anterior subglottic mass extending into the anterior commissure (Figure, A). Tracheobronchoscopy revealed a distal tracheal submucosal mass partially obstructing the left mainstem bronchus (Figure, B). Excisional biopsy of the postcricoid and subglottic masses with the carbon dioxide laser was performed (Figure, C). Histopathologic examination demonstrated mucosal infiltration by a monotonous population of cells with round nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm (Figure, D), positive for S-100 and lightly positive for CD68, with occasional interspersed more darkly staining cells, consistent with histiocytes and giant cells. Sections stained negative for epithelial, muscle, endothelial, and glial cell immunohistologic markers.A, Direct laryngoscopy of the larynx. B, Rigid bronchoscopy of the larynx.

Sections stained negative for epithelial, muscle, endothelial, and glial cell immunohistologic markers.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is **multifocal granular cell tumor**. Granular cell tumors are benign neoplasms that most commonly occur in the head and neck, including the larynx. They are typically seen in adults, but can occur in children. The cause of granular cell tumors is unknown, but they are thought to arise from Schwann cells. Granular cell tumors are usually asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms such as dysphonia, dysphagia, and stridor. The diagnosis is made with biopsy. Treatment is typically surgical excision, with good long-term outcomes.

Title: Recurrent Pneumonia in an Infant Case is: A full-term 2719-g female infant was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on day 1 of life after developing respiratory distress requiring endotracheal intubation. Gestation was complicated by polyhydramnios and gestational diabetes. In the NICU, choking and desaturation were noted with oral feeding. Videofluoroscopic swallow study demonstrated aspiration with all consistencies. Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were conducted, and the patient was diagnosed as having a type II laryngeal cleft. At 2 weeks of age, she decompensated secondary to Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis and was intubated for persistent left lung collapse. At that time, computed tomographic (CT) imaging was performed, revealing the etiology of her respiratory decompensation (Figure 1).Coronal computed tomographic image of the chest with contrast.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:

The patient is a full-term 2719-g female infant who was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on day 1 of life after developing respiratory distress requiring endotracheal intubation. Gestation was complicated by polyhydramnios and gestational diabetes. In the NICU, choking and desaturation were noted with oral feeding. Videofluoroscopic swallow study demonstrated aspiration with all consistencies. Microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were conducted, and the patient was diagnosed as having a type II laryngeal cleft. At 2 weeks of age, she decompensated secondary to Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis and was intubated for persistent left lung collapse. At that time, computed tomographic (CT) imaging was performed, revealing the etiology of her respiratory decompensation.

The CT image shows a large cystic mass in the left upper lobe of the lung. This mass is likely a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM). CCAMs are hamartomatous lesions that are thought to arise from abnormal development of the lung bud. They are usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood, and they can cause respiratory symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and recurrent pneumonia. Treatment for CCAMs depends on the size and location of the lesion. Small lesions may be monitored without treatment, while larger lesions may require surgery.

In this case, the patient has a large CCAM in the left upper lobe of the lung. This lesion is causing respiratory symptoms, and it is likely to continue to grow. Therefore, the patient should undergo surgery to remove the CCAM.

Answer:

The answer is (B), Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM).

Title: Recalcitrant Orbital Pain in a 50-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for 3 months of right orbital pain. Her medical history was noncontributory. Examination revealed a right afferent pupillary defect, visual acuity of hand motion OD and 20/30 OS, full extraocular movements, and bilateral retinal dot blot hemorrhages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhancement along the right intracanalicular optic nerve and adjacent sinuses (Figure). Glycosylated hemoglobin level was elevated at 10.3% (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). Workup results for sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, seropositive and seronegative arthropathies, human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, syphilis, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 were negative.T1 fat-suppressed postgadolinium magnetic resonance imaging. A, Contrast enhancement centered on the right intracanalicular optic nerve (blue arrowhead), involving right orbital apex and posterior ethmoidal sinus (white arrowhead). B, Enhancement encircling right optic nerve (arrowhead).Orbital apex and sinus biopsy revealed acute and chronic inflammation without neoplasm or microorganisms. Specimen cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient was diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes and MSSA sino-orbital infection. She was discharged 10 days later with intravenous (IV) antibacterials, sitagliptin, insulin, and oral opiates.The patient returned to the emergency department 2 weeks later with recurrent orbital pain. Although examination was stable, MRI showed increased apical enhancement. The diagnosis was revised to nonspecific orbital inflammation and the neurology department initiated a 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone. Pain rapidly resolved, repeated MRI showed reduced enhancement, and she was discharged with a prednisone taper.Ten days later, the patient returned once again to the emergency department with pain. Although imaging was stable, examination revealed visual acuity of no light perception OD and new-onset right-sided third, fourth, and sixth cranial neuropathies.What Would You Do Next? A: Repeat IV methyprednisolone with slower taper , B: Initiate steroid-sparing immunomodulator , C: Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibacterials , D: Repeat biopsy of orbital apex and sinuses. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of orbital pain, which was initially diagnosed as a sino-orbital infection. She was treated with IV antibacterials and discharged with a prednisone taper. However, she returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain and new-onset visual loss. Imaging showed no change, but examination revealed third, fourth, and sixth cranial neuropathies. This suggests that the patient may have a compressive optic neuropathy, which is a medical emergency. The most likely cause of a compressive optic neuropathy in this patient is an orbital apex tumor. Other possible causes include an inflammatory process, such as sarcoidosis, or a vascular lesion, such as an arteriovenous malformation.

Answer: The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the orbital apex to determine the underlying cause of the compressive optic neuropathy. This will guide further management, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. The other options are not appropriate in this situation.

A. Repeat IV methyprednisolone with slower taper is not appropriate because the patient has already been treated with steroids and her condition has worsened.

B. Initiate steroid-sparing immunomodulator is not appropriate because the patient does not have a systemic inflammatory disease.

C. Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibacterials is not appropriate because the patient does not have an infection.

D. Repeat biopsy of orbital apex and sinuses is the correct answer because it is the only option that will help to determine the underlying cause of the compressive optic neuropathy.

Title: Hemorrhagic Descemet Membrane Detachment After Canaloplasty Case is: A man in his 50s presented with primary open-angle glaucoma and a visually significant cataract, causing a 4-diopter myopic shift. The patient elected to proceed with cataract extraction and a lens implant followed by canaloplasty. The cataract extraction and lens implant went routinely, but during the canaloplasty, a hard-stop obstruction was encountered at the 7-o’clock position during the passage of the illuminated catheter. A viscoelastic material was injected into the Schlemm canal to attempt to break the obstruction. This resulted in a large inferior nasal Descemet membrane detachment. A washout was not performed because of concerns of further exacerbating the detachment or inducing a hemorrhage. The procedure was aborted, a 50% air bubble was injected into the eye, and the physicians recommended that the patient maintain a face-up position. The patient had a persistent Descemet membrane detachment at the 1-day postoperative visit (Figure). By the 1-week postoperative visit, the patient began to develop blood in the interface, which had not resolved by the 1-month postoperative visit with a visual acuity of 20/50 (Figure).Hemorrhagic Descemet membrane detachment after canaloplasty. A, At postoperative day 1, a persistent Descemet membrane detachment was observed with no blood in the detachment interface. B, At postoperative month 1, blood was observed in the interface, which appeared by the postoperative week 1 visit. The arrowheads indicate the area of detachment.Take the patient to the operating room for a saline washout with an air bubbleTake the patient to the operating room for an alteplase washout with an air bubbleWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient has a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface. This is a serious complication of canaloplasty, and it is important to take steps to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

There are several options for treating a Descemet membrane detachment. One option is to perform a saline washout. This involves injecting a solution of saline into the eye to remove the blood and debris from the interface. Another option is to perform an alteplase washout. This involves injecting a solution of alteplase, a drug that helps to dissolve blood clots, into the eye.

In this case, I would recommend performing a saline washout. This is a relatively simple procedure that has a high success rate. Alteplase washout is a more complex procedure with a higher risk of complications. In addition, the patient's visual acuity is already significantly reduced, so it is important to avoid any further risk of complications.

Title: Acute Eye Pain Following Prolonged Face-Down Positioning in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome Case is: A woman in her late teens with Marfan syndrome and a history of dislocated lenses presented with blurry vision, pain, and photophobia in her right eye. Her symptoms began 6 hours before presentation after she had been napping face-down on her desk for 30 minutes. Her medical history included aortic repair and cervical spine abnormalities. Her ocular history was pertinent for high myopia and contact lens wear, a posteriorly dislocated crystalline lens suspended in the vitreous cavity in her right eye, and a superotemporally subluxated crystalline lens in her left eye. Her lenses had been observed for years without intervention. The patient’s family history was unknown because she was adopted. Her medications included oral aspirin and irbesartan.Visual acuity was counting fingers OD (without correction) and 20/30 OS (with correction). The right pupil was corectopic and fixed at 5 mm while the left pupil was round and reactive; no afferent pupillary defect was seen. Extraocular motility was normal. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 43 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Examination of the right eye revealed conjunctival injection, corneal stromal edema with Descemet folds and lenticulocorneal touch, a shallowed anterior chamber, and a lens protruding through the pupil with the superior edge in the anterior chamber (Figure 1A). The posterior view was limited to red reflex. The left eye was unremarkable except for a superotemporally subluxated lens (Figure 1B).Slitlamp photography. A, Right eye demonstrates dislocation of the superior crystalline lens into the anterior chamber. B, Left eye shows superotemporal subluxation of the crystalline lens.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a posteriorly dislocated crystalline lens suspended in the vitreous cavity in her right eye. This is a complication of Marfan syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, pain, and photophobia are consistent with acute angle closure glaucoma. This is a condition in which the angle between the iris and cornea narrows, obstructing the flow of aqueous humor out of the eye. Aqueous humor is a clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye and helps to maintain intraocular pressure. If the intraocular pressure rises too high, it can damage the optic nerve and lead to blindness.

The first step in treating acute angle closure glaucoma is to lower the intraocular pressure. This can be done with medications, such as beta-blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to open the angle and restore the flow of aqueous humor.

In this case, the patient should be treated with atropine and IOP-lowering drops. Atropine is a medication that dilates the pupil and helps to open the angle. IOP-lowering drops are medications that reduce the production of aqueous humor or increase its drainage. The patient should also be placed in a supine position to further reduce the intraocular pressure.

If the patient's symptoms do not improve with medical treatment, she may need to undergo surgery. A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous humor from the eye. The vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that fills the back of the eye. Removing the vitreous humor can help to open the angle and restore the flow of aqueous humor.

A lensectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the lens from the eye. The lens is a clear structure that focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye. Removing the lens can help to lower the intraocular pressure and improve the patient's vision.

Title: Diffuse Retinal Hemorrhages After Uncomplicated Glaucoma Drainage Implantation Case is: A healthy adolescent Latino man with juvenile open-angle glaucoma underwent Ahmed valve placement in the left eye via uncomplicated surgery. Preoperative Snellen visual acuity was 20/40 and intraocular pressure (IOP) was 36 mm Hg; on postoperative day 1, IOP was 10 mm Hg and visual acuity fell to count fingers. Slitlamp examination of the left eye revealed an elevated bleb over the Ahmed plate with no leakage. The cornea was clear and compact, and there was a well-positioned tube overlying the iris superotemporally. The anterior chamber was deep with trace inflammation. Dilated fundus examination revealed disc edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages throughout the posterior pole and periphery (Figure 1). Spontaneous venous pulsations were not appreciated. Slitlamp examination of the right eye revealed a normal anterior and posterior segment, with no retinal vascular abnormality or hemorrhage.The fundus of the left eye showed peripapillary hemorrhages, nasal disc edema, and diffuse retinal and preretinal hemorrhages throughout the posterior pole and periphery; a white-centered hemorrhage is found within the superior macula.Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testingWhat Would You Do Next?

Title: An Unusual Cause of Small-Bowel Obstruction Case is: A 43-year-old man with generally good health presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of cramps and abdominal pain. For the past year, the patient had been investigated for hypochromic microcytic anemia. As part of the investigation, he underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and a colonoscopy, which revealed a normal-looking bowel with no obvious source of bleeding visualized. Further investigation involved capsule endoscopy, which was ingested 3 days prior to his emergency department admission. The patient claimed not to have passed a bowel movement containing the capsule. Physical examination results were normal except for a nontender distended and tympanic abdomen. Results of routine laboratory testing were essentially normal except for a low level of hemoglobin (8.1 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]), with no leukocytosis noted. Contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography demonstrated a small-bowel obstruction, with a transition zone located at the mid-jejunum. An intraluminal hypodense mass was demonstrated in this area and appeared to be the cause of the obstruction. Adjacent to this area, the capsule was clearly demonstrated in a dilated proximal loop of the small bowel (Figure 1).Computed tomographic scan showing an intraluminal hypodense mass (pink arrowhead) causing a small-bowel obstruction. Adjacent to this area, the endoscopic capsule (asterisk) is demonstrated in a proximal dilated loop of the small bowel.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient presents with a sudden onset of cramps and abdominal pain, which is consistent with small-bowel obstruction. The patient has a history of hypochromic microcytic anemia, which could be caused by a number of factors, including small-bowel tumors. The patient underwent capsule endoscopy, which revealed a normal-looking bowel with no obvious source of bleeding visualized. However, the capsule was not passed in a bowel movement, which suggests that it may have been trapped in the small bowel. The patient's physical examination results were normal except for a nontender distended and tympanic abdomen. This is consistent with small-bowel obstruction. The patient's laboratory results were essentially normal except for a low level of hemoglobin (8.1 g/dL). This is consistent with anemia, which could be caused by a number of factors, including small-bowel tumors. The patient's contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography demonstrated a small-bowel obstruction, with a transition zone located at the mid-jejunum. An intraluminal hypodense mass was demonstrated in this area and appeared to be the cause of the obstruction. Adjacent to this area, the capsule was clearly demonstrated in a dilated proximal loop of the small bowel. This is consistent with a small-bowel tumor causing small-bowel obstruction.

Answer:
The most likely diagnosis is a small-bowel tumor. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory results, and imaging studies. The patient's history of hypochromic microcytic anemia could be caused by a number of factors, including small-bowel tumors. The patient's physical examination results were normal except for a nontender distended and tympanic abdomen. This is consistent with small-bowel obstruction. The patient's laboratory results were essentially normal except for a low level of hemoglobin (8.1 g/dL).

An intraluminal hypodense mass was demonstrated in this area and appeared to be the cause of the obstruction. Adjacent to this area, the capsule was clearly demonstrated in a dilated proximal loop of the small bowel.

The differential diagnosis for a small-bowel obstruction includes:

* Adhesions
* Hernia
* Intussusception
* Volvulus
* Neoplasm

In this case, the patient's history of hypochromic microcytic anemia is concerning for a neoplasm. The capsule endoscopy findings are also concerning for a neoplasm, as the intraluminal hypodense mass could represent a tumor. The patient's age and lack of other risk factors for lymphoma make lymphoma less likely. Carcinoid tumors are typically small and often do not cause obstruction. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the small bowel and can cause obstruction.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a GIST.

Although previously healthy, he reported some hospitalizations for nonspecific abdominal pain during his infancy. Colicky abdominal pain started after eating cornflakes in the morning, then regressed spontaneously during the day. A relapse of the symptoms occurred the morning after and worsened during the day, with the onset of nausea as well. For this reason, the patient autonomously took 2 tablets of hyoscine butyl bromide without any benefit. His bowel was initially open to gas and normal stools but, afterward, only to gas. A physical examination revealed a soft and nondistended abdomen, with localized tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region and in the right lower quadrant. Hyperactive bowel sounds could be heard. The results of a digital rectal examination were normal. His vital signs were as follows: an axillary temperature of 37.3°C, a pulse rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg. The results of a urinalysis were negative; blood test results were within the normal limits, except for an elevated white blood cell count of 13 000/μL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), an unconjugated bilirubin level of 1.2 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 17.104), an increased aspartate aminotransferase level of 52 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167), and an alanine aminotransferase level of 136 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167). His C-reactive protein level was 10 mg/L (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524). A plain radiograph of his abdomen was negative for air-fluid levels and for signs of perforation. Further evaluation of his abdomen using ultrasonography revealed hepatic steatosis and, in the right lower quadrant, thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins (Figure 1).Ultrasonographic images of the right iliac fossa (A) and the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (B) with thickened cecal wall (a) and hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins (b).What Is Your Diagnosis?

His C-reactive protein level was 10 mg/L. A plain radiograph of his abdomen was negative for air-fluid levels and for signs of perforation. Further evaluation of his abdomen using ultrasonography revealed hepatic steatosis and, in the right lower quadrant, thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins.

The most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with appendicitis, and the ultrasonographic findings are highly suggestive of the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of right lower quadrant pain, such as cecal carcinoma, cecal diverticulitis, and terminal ileitis. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. The diagnosis is usually made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The treatment is appendectomy.

Title: A Rapidly Expanding Scalp Mass Case is: A woman in her 80s presented to the emergency room (ER) with a 2-week history of enlarging left parietal scalp mass. She initially was seen by her primary care practitioner, where neurological examination was nonfocal. The mass continued to enlarge and she developed progressive generalized weakness, slowed speech, and focal right-handed weakness. Acute onset of headache and decline in mental status prompted presentation to the ER. On examination an 8-cm left parietal mass was tender to palpation. Treatment with 4 mg of dexamethasone was initiated intravenously. All biochemical laboratory results were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a large enhancing left frontal-parietal mass extending both extracranially and intracranially into the superior sagittal sinus (Figure). There was left frontal, parietal, and temporal bone involvement, and left dural thickening. Intracranially, there was adjacent vasogenic edema and associated mass effect. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a ground-glass sclerotic lesion of the right sacrum. Owing to involvement of the superior sagittal sinus and progressive growth, an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was performed.Large extracranial and intracranial mass extending into the superior sagittal sinus, brain, soft tissue, and bone, with left dural thickening as visualized on T1 postcontrast imaging coronal (A) and sagittal (B) views.

Reasoning:
The patient is an elderly woman with a rapidly expanding scalp mass. The mass is tender to palpation, and the patient has developed progressive generalized weakness, slowed speech, and focal right-handed weakness. The patient also has headache and decline in mental status. The brain magnetic resonance imaging shows a large enhancing left frontal-parietal mass extending both extracranially and intracranially into the superior sagittal sinus. There is left frontal, parietal, and temporal bone involvement, and left dural thickening. Intracranially, there is adjacent vasogenic edema and associated mass effect. The computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis reveal a ground-glass sclerotic lesion of the right sacrum.

The differential diagnosis for a rapidly expanding scalp mass includes meningioma, glioblastoma multiforme, meningeal sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and they are typically slow-growing. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive primary brain tumor, and it is typically seen in younger patients. Meningeal sarcomas are rare, and they are typically seen in patients with a history of cancer. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can involve the brain, but it is typically seen in patients with a history of lymphoma.

The patient's age, rapid tumor growth, and involvement of the superior sagittal sinus suggest a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. The ground-glass sclerotic lesion of the right sacrum is a characteristic finding of glioblastoma multiforme.

Title: A 55-Year-Old Man With a Painful Rash on the Sole of His Foot Case is: A 55-year-old man with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia presented to the clinic with a 6-day history of a painful rash on the sole of his right foot. He described the pain as akin to stepping on a sharp object and characterized it as moderately intense, sharp, continuous, and without radiation. After first noticing the pain, he had examined the inside of his boot but did not identify anything that would account for the tenderness. He reported no fevers, chills, or malaise. He denied history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, chickenpox, or recurrent infections. His medications included amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and ezetimibe. He worked outdoors for an oil drilling company. He denied recent travel out of the country. Physical examination revealed 2- to 3-mm grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a discrete area of the sole of the right foot (Figure) and no additional rashes elsewhere on the body. Vesicular fluid was sent for analysis.Left, Grouped vesicles on sole of patient’s right foot. Right, Closer view of vesicles.What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's rash is most consistent with herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Shingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person has chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body's nerve cells. In some people, the virus can reactivate years later, causing shingles.

Shingles is characterized by a painful rash that typically appears on one side of the body, often in a band-like pattern. The rash may also be accompanied by fever, headache, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of shingles is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. Antiviral medications, such as valacyclovir, can be used to treat shingles and shorten the duration of the rash and pain.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with shingles. The patient's rash is a painful, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a discrete area of the sole of the right foot. The patient also has no fevers, chills, or malaise.

The most appropriate next step is to initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir. Valacyclovir is a prescription medication that is used to treat herpes zoster. It works by preventing the virus from multiplying and causing further damage. Valacyclovir is usually taken for 7 to 10 days.

Title: Fever and a Pustular Rash Case is: A previously healthy man in his 40s presented with 4 days of fever and a rash. He noticed multiple acneiform papules and pustules around the neckline that progressed to involve the face, torso, and limbs. He took no prescribed medications but had taken an ibuprofen pill a week prior for a mild headache; his symptoms started 3 days after that. He had no sick contacts or recent travel and reported no use of alcohol or tobacco.On examination, he was febrile (38.9°C) and tachycardic but normotensive. Clusters of pustules, approximately 1 mm in diameter, were present over an erythematous base overlying the face, neck, chest, back, and arms (Figure). Laboratory analysis revealed values within normal ranges for hemoglobin (13.1 g/dL) and platelet count (186 ×109/L); an elevated white blood cell count (22.3 x109/L; 82% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 5% eosinophils, 4% monocytes); erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 58 mm/h (reference range, 0-20); C-reactive protein level of 232 mg/L (2210 nmol/L) (reference, <5 mg/dL [48 nmol/L]); and normal renal and hepatic function. Gram stain of the pustule fluid revealed no organisms, and cultures of the blood and pustule fluid were without growth. A punch biopsy of the skin lesions showed subcorneal pustules containing neutrophils and eosinophils, with epidermal spongiosis.Avoid further ibuprofen use and prescribe a topical steroidWhat Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a rare but self-limited inflammatory skin condition that typically occurs in healthy individuals after taking certain medications, such as ibuprofen. The most common laboratory findings in AGEP are leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein. A punch biopsy of the skin lesions is often diagnostic, showing subcorneal pustules containing neutrophils and eosinophils, with epidermal spongiosis.

Treatment of AGEP is typically supportive, with avoidance of the inciting medication and administration of topical steroids. In severe cases, systemic corticosteroids may be necessary.

Title: A 24-Year-Old Man With a Left Frontal Brain Mass Case is: A healthy 24-year-old man presented with 1 week of headache, gait imbalance, and coordination difficulties. His mother reported that he had experienced personality changes. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. He reported smoking marijuana and denied tobacco and intravenous drug use. He is sexually active, with multiple male partners.On examination, he was alert and oriented, with a temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure of 131/90 mm Hg, heart rate of 94/min, respiratory rate of 18/min with pulse oximetry of 98% on ambient air, and a body mass index of 28.1 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Neurologic examination was significant for hyperreflexia in all extremities, bilateral shoulder weakness, and right-sided pronator drift. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 3600/μL (73.5% neutrophils, 16.4% lymphocytes, 7.8% monocytes, 1.4% eosinophils, 0.6% basophils); the remainder of the complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable. The result of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 antibody test was positive, and CD4 cell count was 73/mm3. Results of serologic testing for Toxoplasma gondii IgG were negative. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the brain showed a left caudate nucleus and lentiform nucleus lesion with mass effect on the left lateral ventricle (Figure, left panel). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain confirmed the presence of an aggressive mass lesion extending through the corpus callosum (Figure, right panel). CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and spinal MRI were unremarkable.Left, Computed tomography scan of the brain, axial view, with contrast.

Reasoning:
The patient is a 24-year-old man with a left frontal brain mass. He is HIV-positive and has a CD4 cell count of 73/mm3. He has a history of smoking marijuana and is sexually active with multiple male partners. His mother reports that he has experienced personality changes.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a toxoplasma encephalitis. Toxoplasma encephalitis is a rare but serious infection of the brain that can occur in people with HIV. It is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which is most commonly transmitted through contact with cat feces.

The patient's risk factors for toxoplasma encephalitis include his HIV infection, his low CD4 cell count, and his history of smoking marijuana. Marijuana use can suppress the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infections such as toxoplasma encephalitis.

The patient's presentation is also concerning for a primary CNS lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the brain or spinal cord. It is more common in people with HIV.

The patient's risk factors for primary CNS lymphoma include his HIV infection, his low CD4 cell count, and his history of smoking marijuana. Marijuana use can suppress the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infections such as primary CNS lymphoma.

The patient's imaging studies show a left frontal brain mass. This could be a toxoplasma abscess, a primary CNS lymphoma, or another type of brain tumor.

The next step in the patient's management is to obtain a brain biopsy. A brain biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the brain and examined under a microscope. This will help to determine the cause of the patient's brain mass.

Title: Painful Ulcerative Lesions on Bilateral Lower Extremities Case is: A young black woman with a history of Graves disease presented with painful lesions on both legs. She reported chills, bilateral lower extremity swelling, and several small, painful, “pimple-like bumps” appearing on her bilateral lower legs, which ulcerated several days later. The ulcers progressed despite a recent course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for cultures growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient’s medications included methimazole and atenolol, which she had been taking since her diagnosis of Graves disease 1 year prior. She had not taken other over-the-counter medications or supplements. Physical examination of her bilateral lower extremities revealed pitting edema and multiple discrete, round, dry ulcers, most with central eschars, dusky gray borders, and collarettes of scale (Figure, A). Results from the initial laboratory workup revealed elevated levels of C-reactive protein and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A punch biopsy specimen of an ulcer edge demonstrated a mid- and deep dermal marked lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and focal abscess, suggesting a nonspecific infection. The patient was initially treated with cephalexin, mupirocin, and conservative wound care, but the eruption later worsened, with new lesions appearing on her right leg. During follow-up, an intact 4-mm papular lesion was identified on her lower right leg (Figure, B). No pathergy at the previous punch biopsy site was observed. A biopsy of the new intact papule was performed (Figure, C and D).A, Discrete, round, dry ulcers with central eschar and raised borders on left lateral lower leg.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, neutrophilic dermatosis that is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic malignancies. The characteristic lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum are painful, necrotic ulcers that typically begin as small, erythematous papules or nodules. The ulcers often have a violaceous border and a central eschar. They may be associated with fever, chills, and malaise.

The patient's biopsy findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The histopathologic features of pyoderma gangrenosum include a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis, with associated ulceration and necrosis. The infiltrate may also extend into the subcutaneous tissue.

The patient's initial treatment with cephalexin, mupirocin, and conservative wound care was unsuccessful. This is not surprising, as pyoderma gangrenosum is often resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy. The patient's condition subsequently worsened, with new lesions appearing on her right leg.

The patient's diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was confirmed by a biopsy of the new intact papule. The histopathologic findings were consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.

The patient was treated with a course of systemic corticosteroids, which resulted in significant improvement in her condition. The ulcers healed, and the patient's fever, chills, and malaise resolved.

The patient's case illustrates the clinical features, histopathologic findings, and treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

**Reasoning:** The patient is a middle-aged man with a 7-year history of a progressive pruritic eruption involving the nose and dorsal hands. He had no improvement following treatment with class 1 topical corticosteroids and keratolytic emollients. On review of systems, he endorsed photosensitivity during childhood only. He denied any history of blistering, angioedema, dysphagia, hoarseness, dyspnea, or weight loss. Physical examination revealed multiple skin-colored, waxy, smooth and variably verrucous papules and plaques on the dorsum of the nose and hands. Initial laboratory evaluation, including complete blood cell count, blood chemistry panel, liver function tests, serum/urine protein electrophoresis, and urine porphyrins, had unremarkable results. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained from the left dorsal hand for further evaluation.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes nodular amyloidosis, erythropoietic protoporphyria, colloid milium, and lipoid proteinosis. Nodular amyloidosis is a rare, systemic disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the skin, kidneys, heart, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in patients with multiple myeloma or Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is an inherited disorder of heme biosynthesis that is characterized by photosensitivity, skin fragility, and blistering. It is caused by a mutation in the ferrochelatase gene. Colloid milium is a benign, non-inflammatory condition characterized by the accumulation of small, white papules in the skin. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women. Lipoid proteinosis is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich material in the skin, eyes, and other organs. It is caused by a mutation in the extracellular matrix protein 1 gene.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of nodular amyloidosis. The patient's history of progressive pruritic eruption involving the nose and dorsal hands is typical of nodular amyloidosis. The patient's physical examination findings of multiple skin-colored, waxy, smooth and variably verrucous papules and plaques on the dorsum of the nose and hands are also typical of nodular amyloidosis. The patient's laboratory evaluation results were unremarkable, which is consistent with nodular amyloidosis. The patient's punch biopsy specimen showed nodular deposits of amyloid in the dermis, which is diagnostic of nodular amyloidosis.

Title: Diffuse Vesicular Eruption Case is: A man in his 70s with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and prescribed cyclosporine, 100 mg twice daily, for pure red cell aplasia was admitted for spreading painful blisters on the hands and feet. He had initially developed rhinorrhea, cough, and low-grade fever 2 weeks prior. The patient was treated with azithromycin and subsequently developed few small, pruritic blisters on the hands and feet. He went to an urgent care facility and was diagnosed as having bronchitis and prescribed doxycycline and diphenhydramine. Over the next several days, he developed worsening fever, chills, and blisters and bullae on the arms, legs, and face. He was admitted to the hospital, and the dermatology service was consulted. Physical examination revealed numerous pink to violaceous macules, papules, and patches on the palms, dorsal hands, forearms, elbows, feet, and distal lower extremities (Figure, A and B). Fewer, scattered macules were on the face, neck, trunk, upper legs, upper arms, and scrotum. Dusky bullae were seen on the bilateral dorsal aspect of the hands, fingers, toes, and heels. In the oral cavity, there was 1 violaceous macule on the right buccal mucosa and a few linear, horizontal, white lines on the left buccal mucosa. Laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell count of 25 600/μL (reference range, 3700-10 500/μL) and a platelet count of 12 400/μL (reference range, 15 000-40 000/μL). Results from a Tzanck smear from the initial lesion on the right dorsal aspects of the third finger were negative for multinucleated giant cells.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 70s with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and prescribed cyclosporine, 100 mg twice daily, for pure red cell aplasia. He had initially developed rhinorrhea, cough, and low-grade fever 2 weeks prior. The patient was treated with azithromycin and subsequently developed few small, pruritic blisters on the hands and feet. He went to an urgent care facility and was diagnosed as having bronchitis and prescribed doxycycline and diphenhydramine. Over the next several days, he developed worsening fever, chills, and blisters and bullae on the arms, legs, and face. He was admitted to the hospital, and the dermatology service was consulted. Physical examination revealed numerous pink to violaceous macules, papules, and patches on the palms, dorsal hands, forearms, elbows, feet, and distal lower extremities (Figure, A and B). Fewer, scattered macules were on the face, neck, trunk, upper legs, upper arms, and scrotum. Dusky bullae were seen on the bilateral dorsal aspect of the hands, fingers, toes, and heels. In the oral cavity, there was 1 violaceous macule on the right buccal mucosa and a few linear, horizontal, white lines on the left buccal mucosa.

Results from a Tzanck smear from the initial lesion on the right dorsal aspects of the third finger were negative for multinucleated giant cells. A punch biopsy was performed on the anterior side of the thigh (Figure, C and D).

The most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme (EM). EM is a type of skin rash that can be caused by a number of different things, including infections, medications, and autoimmune diseases. The rash typically starts with small, red spots that may blister or ooze. The spots often form a target-like pattern, with a red center and a pale ring around it. EM can be a serious condition, but it is usually not life-threatening. The treatment for EM depends on the underlying cause. In most cases, the rash will go away on its own within a few weeks. However, in some cases, treatment with steroids or other medications may be necessary.

In this case, the patient has a number of risk factors for developing EM, including his age, his history of CLL, and his use of cyclosporine. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are also consistent with EM. The Tzanck smear was negative for multinucleated giant cells, which helps to rule out herpes zoster. The punch biopsy showed findings that are consistent with EM, including subepidermal bullae, a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and necrotic keratinocytes.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme.

Title: Cerebellar Ataxia and Hearing Impairment Case is: A 51-year-old man presented with progressive difficulty walking that developed over 1 month shortly after he ran a marathon. He frequently fell and had difficulty climbing the stairs. He stated he had hearing problems, but with further questioning, it was discovered he actually had difficulty deciphering speech. He did not have dizziness on standing nor bowel or bladder incontinence. He did not take medications, and he drank socially. He had no family history of imbalance problems. He still worked full-time as a lawyer. His neurological examination showed mild cerebellar ataxia without myoclonus or parkinsonism. His Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 28 of 30 points (2 points deducted from “delayed recall”). Pure tone audiometry showed no conductive or sensorineural hearing loss. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormal signal, including from the pons and cerebellum. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no malignancy. Results from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing were normal without oligoclonal bands and a normal level of protein 14-3-3. He had no paraneoplastic antibodies in his serum or CSF. Results from electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. One month later, his condition progressed; he required a wheelchair, declined cognitively, and developed personality changes. Neurological examination showed slurred speech, worsened cerebellar ataxia, and impaired postural reflex without myoclonus/asterixis. He developed seizures and was admitted to a hospital. His mental status continued to progressively decline, and he became completely mute; he could only open his eyes and follow commands to protrude his tongue but was unable to move his eyes or any limbs. Electroencephalogram showed diffuse slowing.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:

The patient presented with progressive difficulty walking, hearing problems, and cognitive decline. The neurological examination showed mild cerebellar ataxia without myoclonus or parkinsonism. Brain MRI revealed no abnormal signal, including from the pons and cerebellum. A computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no malignancy. Results from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing were normal without oligoclonal bands and a normal level of protein 14-3-3. He had no paraneoplastic antibodies in his serum or CSF. Results from electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome (AOA-PCAS). AOA-PCAS is a rare, inherited disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, optic nerves, and peripheral nerves. The disease typically begins in adulthood and affects men and women equally. The symptoms of AOA-PCAS vary from person to person, but may include cerebellar ataxia (loss of coordination), optic atrophy (loss of vision), hearing loss, pes cavus (high-arched feet), and areflexia (loss of reflexes). There is no cure for AOA-PCAS, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life for those affected by the disease.

Answer:

The correct answer is B. Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome.

Title: Personality Changes, Executive Dysfunction, and Motor and Memory Impairment Case is: A 21-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of progressive depression, bradyphrenia, dyscalculia, and fatigue, necessitating withdrawal from college. She had an ovarian cyst, but her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. There was no history of recreational drug use, tobacco or alcohol consumption, or sexually transmitted diseases. Her mother had died at 32 years of age, after having a chronic neuropsychiatric illness, culminating in a rapidly progressive dementia. A postmortem brain examination reported the presence of multitudinous corpora amylacea, but no specific neuropathological diagnosis was made.Neurologic examination of the patient during the initial consultation revealed a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 of 30 (points were missed on attention, calculation, and abstraction), and the patient was abulic, but it was otherwise unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter affecting the corpus callosum, bifrontal, and biparietal regions, associated with bifrontal and bitemporal atrophy (Figure1A). No lesions were identified in the cerebellum or brainstem. There was no abnormal enhancement. Laboratory investigations including complete blood cell count with differential; electrolytes; liver, renal, and thyroid function tests; vitamin B12 and folate levels; vitamin E; cholesterol and triglycerides; amino acids (serum and urine); syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus serologies; a paraneoplastic panel; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were unrevealing. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a slight protein elevation, but no pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands, or elevated immunoglobulin G synthesis rate. Arylsulfatase activity was normal.A, Axial T2 sequence showing bifrontal cerebral convexity sulcal enlargement greater than expected for patient's age, punctate bifrontal subcortical fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense foci (right greater than left) are noted.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's presentation is consistent with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is a rare, inherited disorder that causes progressive damage to the small blood vessels in the brain. This damage can lead to a variety of symptoms, including personality changes, executive dysfunction, motor and memory impairment, and seizures. The patient's family history is also consistent with CADASIL, as her mother had a similar illness. The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with CADASIL, as they show scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter affecting the corpus callosum, bifrontal, and biparietal regions, associated with bifrontal and bitemporal atrophy. The patient's laboratory investigations and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were unrevealing, which is also consistent with CADASIL.

Multiple ill-defined 1-cm blue-gray macules, a few of which contain a central 2-mm dome-shaped pink papule (black arrowhead) on the chest and abdomen.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's rash includes drug rash, pediculosis corporis, leukemia cutis, and varicella-zoster virus infection.

Drug rash is a common cause of skin rash in hospitalized patients. It can be caused by any medication, but is most commonly seen with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and chemotherapy drugs. The rash is usually characterized by a widespread eruption of erythematous macules and papules, which may be pruritic. In some cases, the rash may be more severe and can involve bullae, desquamation, and systemic symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy.

Pediculosis corporis is an infestation of the skin by head lice. The lice lay eggs (nits) on the hair shafts, which attach to the hair with a sticky glue-like substance. The nits are difficult to remove and can remain on the hair for up to 3 weeks. The main symptom of pediculosis corporis is itching, which may be severe. The rash may also be associated with excoriation, secondary infection, and lymphadenopathy.

Leukemia cutis is a skin manifestation of leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of purpuric or ecchymotic macules and papules, which may be associated with petechiae and ecchymoses. The rash is usually widespread and may involve the trunk, extremities, and mucous membranes. Leukemia cutis is a sign of advanced disease and is often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Varicella-zoster virus infection is a common viral infection that causes chicken pox. The rash is characterized by a widespread eruption of erythematous macules and papules, which rapidly become vesicular. The vesicles are then crusted over and resolve over a period of 1-2 weeks. The rash is usually pruritic and may be associated with fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy.

In this case, the patient's rash is most consistent with varicella-zoster virus infection. The patient has a history of exposure to chicken pox, the rash is widespread and vesicular, and the patient is febrile. The other possible diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

Title: A 51-Year-Old Man With Exercise-Induced Syncope Case is: A 51-year-old man who experienced syncope while exercising on the treadmill at the gym presented for further evaluation. He had no significant medical history. Results from basic laboratory testing, including serum electrolytes, troponin, and complete blood cell counts, were unremarkable. Routine electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation (Figure 1A) revealed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, borderline right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. The patient was sent for exercise stress echocardiography. Resting echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular size and function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and no significant valvular abnormalities. Shortly after the patient reached a peak heart rate of 130 beats per minute at 9 minutes 28 seconds of exercise (Figure 1B), his heart rate abruptly decreased to 95 beats per minute, with evidence of AV block (Figure 1C). Subsequent coronary angiogram revealed no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease.A, Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) shows first-degree atrioventricular block and right bundle branch block.

Subsequent coronary angiogram revealed no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a tilt table test. A tilt table test is a procedure that is used to evaluate patients with syncope. The test is performed by placing the patient in a supine position and then tilting the table to a 60-degree angle. The patient is then monitored for signs and symptoms of syncope. A positive tilt table test is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a heart rate decrease of at least 30 beats per minute, accompanied by symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope.

The patient in this case has a history of exercise-induced syncope and a positive exercise stress echocardiography. These findings are suggestive of vasovagal syncope. A tilt table test is the next step in the evaluation of this patient. If the tilt table test is positive, the patient may be treated with a beta-blocker or an alpha-blocker.

Reasoning:

A tilt table test is the next step in the evaluation of this patient because it is the most specific test for vasovagal syncope. A positive tilt table test would confirm the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and would allow for the initiation of treatment.

Title: A Toddler With Nasal Congestion and a Limp Case is: A toddler presented with recent onset of nasal congestion, constant rhinorrhea, and difficulty hearing. Previous treatment with montelukast provided symptomatic relief; however, this was discontinued owing to behavioral changes. His medical history was significant for an unusual gait with anterior displacement of the pelvis and hips since he began walking at 10 months of age. Since then he had experienced intermittent episodes of limping accompanied by pain in both femurs. Radiographs revealed no active fractures but did show extensive bony changes in the long bones and the skull. On examination, mild asymmetry of the head was noted on palpation with prominence of the right temporal and parietal area. On limited endoscopic examination, mucosal edema and mucopurulent discharge were observed in the left more than the right naris. An endoscope could not be advanced posteriorly owing to patient discomfort and right-sided sinonasal obstruction. Multiple macules with irregular borders were observed on the lower back, upper buttock, upper chest, upper neck, and right postauricular area. There was also a varus deformity of the lower extremities with mild discrepancy in leg length. An audiogram showed bilateral conductive hearing loss with a flat tympanogram. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head and neck revealed heterogenous opacification of the right ethmoid and maxillary sinuses with fluid accumulation within the bilateral mastoid bones and middle ears. His thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 0.19 mIU/mL (reference range, 0.5-2.4 mIU/mL), free thyroxine level was 1.3 ng/dL (0.9-1.6 ng/dL), and free triiodothyronine levelwas 4.6 pg/mL (3.4-5.1 pg/mL) (Figure).Computed tomographic images; bone windows.

The most likely diagnosis is McCune-Albright syndrome. McCune-Albright syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple endocrine glands, including the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands. It is characterized by the triad of café au lait spots, fibrous dysplasia, and precocious puberty. Café au lait spots are flat, brown patches that can occur anywhere on the body. Fibrous dysplasia is a disorder of bone growth that can cause bone deformities and pain. Precocious puberty is the onset of puberty at an early age.

The patient in this case has multiple café au lait spots, fibrous dysplasia of the skull, and hearing loss. These findings are consistent with McCune-Albright syndrome. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone level is low, which suggests that his thyroid gland is overactive. This is also consistent with McCune-Albright syndrome.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are Langerhans cell histiocytosis, juvenile Paget disease, and ossifying fibromas. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder of the immune system that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, bone, and liver. Juvenile Paget disease is a rare disorder of bone growth that can cause bone deformities and pain. Ossifying fibromas are benign tumors that can occur in the bone.

The patient in this case does not have any of the typical features of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, juvenile Paget disease, or ossifying fibromas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is McCune-Albright syndrome.

**Answer:**
The answer is B. McCune-Albright syndrome.

Title: Nasal Dorsum Mass in an Infant Case is: An infant girl who was initially seen in the neurosurgical clinic at 7 weeks of age for a left parietal scalp cyst was referred to our clinic after the neurosurgeon discovered a new nasal midline mass  on follow-up examination. Her perinatal and medical histories were otherwise unremarkable. On examination, a 1-cm mobile, well-defined, nontender mass over the nasal dorsum was noted. Findings from the rest of the otolaryngologic examination were normal. Given the superficial nature of the nasal cyst on examination and in an effort to minimize radiation and anesthetic exposure for the patient, computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging were deferred. The preoperative plan was to excise the nasal dermal lesion and carefully inspect for any tracts extending intracranially, which would then warrant imaging and a revised intracranial approach. Intraoperatively, an incision was made above the mass and carried through the subcutaneous tissue to expose a mass with a white wall and pink tissue within. The 0.8 × 0.5 × 0.3-cm mass was freed from the surrounding tissue and excised down to the nasal bone. Careful inspection and palpation after excision revealed no bone involvement or intracranial extension. The neurosurgical team removed the superficial scalp cyst, which was found to be an epidermoid cyst. Histopathologic images of the excised nasal mass are shown in the Figure.Histopathologic images (hematoxylin-eosin) from the nasal mass, showing a disordered admixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient is an infant girl with a 1-cm mobile, well-defined, nontender mass over the nasal dorsum. The mass was not present at birth and was first noted at 7 weeks of age. The patient's perinatal and medical histories are otherwise unremarkable. On examination, the mass is found to be superficial and nontender. There is no evidence of bone involvement or intracranial extension. The histopathologic images show a disordered admixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma. Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartomas are rare benign tumors that occur in children. They are composed of a mixture of mature skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures. They are typically located in the head and neck region, and they are usually asymptomatic. The treatment of rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartomas is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent.

Title: Chalky Vocal Fold Lesions Case is: A man in his 60s was admitted to the hospital for a myocardial infarction. Several days into his stay, he complained of having a hoarse voice for the past year. He denied dyspnea, dysphagia, and reported no weight loss. His medical history was notable for congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and gout. He noted a 10-pack-year smoking history and Agent Orange exposure. On examination, he had no palpable neck masses. The cranial nerves were grossly intact. His voice was rough. He underwent a flexible laryngoscopy, which showed an exophytic yellow-white mid-membranous subepithelial lesion on the bilateral true vocal folds (Figure, A). On stroboscopy, there was decreased vibratory amplitude bilaterally and moderate phase asymmetry. Several weeks later, he underwent an indirect laryngoscopy and vocal fold biopsy in the office. Grossly, pathologic findings showed a chalky white lesion. Histopathologic review showed submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material (Figure, B). The amorphous material was negative for Congo red (Figure, C). Examination of an unstained slide showed needle-shaped birefringent crystals (Figure, D). With this nonspecific but benign diagnosis, and an inability for the patient to go to the operating room secondary to his comorbidities, he agreed to undergo office potassium titanyl phosphate laser photoangiolysis of the lesions to improve vocal fold contour and vibration. More of the chalky material was expressed as the overlying mucosa ablated with very little energy delivered. On follow-up, the lesions persisted but were less bulky.A, Indirect laryngoscopy showing exophytic yellow-white mid-membranous subepithelial lesion on the bilateral true vocal folds.

Grossly, pathologic findings show a chalky white lesion. Histopathologic review shows submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material. The amorphous material is negative for Congo red. Examination of an unstained slide shows needle-shaped birefringent crystals.

The differential diagnosis for a chalky white lesion on the vocal folds includes amyloidosis, laryngeal gout, rheumatoid nodules, and squamous cell carcinoma. Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in the body's tissues. Laryngeal gout is a condition that occurs when uric acid crystals deposit in the vocal folds. Rheumatoid nodules are small, firm lumps that can form on the vocal folds in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the vocal folds.

The patient's history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease suggests that he has a systemic disease, such as amyloidosis. The fact that the lesion is located on the vocal folds suggests that it is a laryngeal condition. The negative result for Congo red stain makes amyloidosis less likely. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals on an unstained slide is consistent with laryngeal gout.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal gout.

Title: Enlarging Floor of Mouth Mass Case is: A man in his 50s presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of swelling in the sublingual area. The swelling had been progressively increasing over the first 3 days but had remained stable over the past week. He denied any history of similar symptoms, pain, fever, odynophagia, or difficulty breathing. He complained of some difficulty swallowing owing to the swelling. He had a history of hypertension and had been prescribed a blood pressure medication (the name of which he could not remember), but he had not been taking it for weeks. He had no other pertinent medical history. Physical examination revealed significant, soft, nontender swelling of the floor of mouth bilaterally causing elevation of the tongue (Figure, A). There was no edema of the tongue or lips. The neck was soft, nontender to palpation, and without palpable lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the soft tissues of the neck with intravenous contrast showed a 6.3-cm anteroposterior × 6.9-cm cranial caudal × 4.8-cm transverse cystic nonenhancing mass centered in the root of the tongue, with elevation of the oral aspect of the tongue and some downward displacement of the floor of mouth (Figure, B and C). The sublingual glands were compressed but otherwise appeared normal, and the sublingual spaces were effaced. Surgical excision via an intraoral approach yielded a smooth, well-circumscribed mass. Histologic examination showed keratinizing squamous epithelium.What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Foregut duplication cyst , B: Dermoid cyst , C: Sublingual abscess , D: Thyroglossal duct cyst.

The sublingual glands were compressed but otherwise appeared normal, and the sublingual spaces were effaced. Surgical excision via an intraoral approach yielded a smooth, well-circumscribed mass. Histologic examination showed keratinizing squamous epithelium.

The most likely diagnosis is a sublingual cyst. Sublingual cysts are the most common type of salivary gland cyst, accounting for approximately 50% of all salivary gland cysts. They are typically lined by keratinizing squamous epithelium and are filled with a serous or mucoid fluid. Sublingual cysts can occur at any age, but they are most common in adults between the ages of 20 and 40. They are more common in women than men.

The exact cause of sublingual cysts is unknown, but they are thought to arise from developmental abnormalities of the salivary glands. They may also be caused by trauma to the sublingual glands.

Sublingual cysts are typically asymptomatic. However, they can cause swelling and discomfort in the floor of the mouth. They can also cause difficulty swallowing and speaking.

The diagnosis of a sublingual cyst is made based on clinical examination and imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment of a sublingual cyst is surgical excision. The cyst is typically removed through an incision in the floor of the mouth. The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia.

The prognosis for patients with sublingual cysts is excellent. The surgery is usually curative, and there is a low risk of recurrence.

Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is a sublingual cyst because it is the most common type of salivary gland cyst. The patient is a man in his 50s, which is the age group in which sublingual cysts are most common. The patient has a history of swelling in the sublingual area that has been progressively increasing over the past 10 days. The swelling is soft and nontender, which is consistent with a cyst. The CT scan shows a cystic mass in the sublingual area, which is further evidence of a cyst. The surgical excision of the mass and the histologic examination showing keratinizing squamous epithelium confirm the diagnosis of a sublingual cyst.

Answer:
The answer is (C), sublingual cyst.

The differential diagnosis for a dark retinal lesion in a young, asymptomatic man includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. Benign conditions include choroidal nevi, choroidal hemangiomas, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) hamartomas. Malignant conditions include choroidal melanomas and metastatic tumors.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a choroidal nevus. Choroidal nevi are common, benign tumors of the choroid. They are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, choroidal nevi can sometimes become cancerous, so it is important to monitor them closely.

In this case, the patient has a stable, asymptomatic choroidal nevus. There is no evidence of tumor growth or metastasis. Therefore, the best course of action is to continue to monitor the lesion with regular eye exams.

Reasoning:
The patient is a preadolescent girl with bilateral optic nerve head changes, including 360° nerve hyperemia with elevation of nasal disc borders bilaterally. She has no significant ocular, medical, or family history. She denies any change in vision, scotomas, transient visual obscurations, dimming of light, photophobia, or pain. She denies headache, pulsatile tinnitus, weight gain, joint pain, lethargy, decreased appetite, fever, or chills. The patient is not taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines; however, she had recently used a short-term course of oral antibiotics for a tooth infection.

The most likely cause of the patient's optic nerve head changes is papilledema, which is swelling of the optic nerve head. Papilledema is a sign of increased intracranial pressure, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including brain tumors, hydrocephalus, and meningitis.

The next step in the evaluation of the patient should be to rule out any serious underlying conditions. This includes a lumbar puncture to measure the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, a brain MRI to look for structural abnormalities, and serum and urine testing to look for evidence of infection or inflammation.

If the patient's evaluation is negative for any serious underlying conditions, then she can be observed with close follow-up. The patient should be instructed to return to the clinic if she develops any new symptoms, such as changes in vision, headache, or nausea.

Reasoning: The patient presents with unilateral optic nerve edema with preserved visual function. The most common causes of optic nerve edema are optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Optic neuritis is most commonly caused by multiple sclerosis, but it can also be caused by viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and toxins. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve, and it is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the posterior part of the optic nerve, and it is most commonly seen in patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with optic neuritis. The patient has a history of intermittent blurry vision in the right eye, which is a common symptom of optic neuritis. The patient also has a skin rash, which can be a sign of multiple sclerosis. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 OU, which is normal. There is a barely perceptible right relative afferent pupillary defect, which is a sign of optic nerve dysfunction. The anterior segment examination is normal. On ophthalmoscopy, there are few vitreous cells with no detectable haze and optic nerve head edema grade IV on the Frisén scale, with peripapillary flame hemorrhages in the right eye. The optic nerve is normal on the left. Automated perimetry using the 24-2 pattern and Swedish interactive threshold algorithm strategy (Humphrey Field Analyzer; Carl Zeiss Meditec) was normal in each eye. Optical coherence tomography showed marked elevation of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer on the right. The remainder of the neurological examination is normal.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's unilateral optic nerve edema includes optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with optic neuritis. The next step in the evaluation of the patient is to order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. The bloodwork will help to rule out other causes of optic nerve edema, such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, and toxins. The magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits will help to rule out other causes of optic nerve edema, such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This will help to rule out some of the possible causes of the patient's optic nerve edema, such as optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, and NMO. The magnetic resonance imaging will also help to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain or orbits that could be causing the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B

**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case presents with unilateral optic nerve edema with preserved visual function. The most common causes of optic nerve edema are optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that is typically caused by multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by a blockage of the blood supply to the optic nerve head, while posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by a blockage of the blood supply to the optic nerve posterior to the optic chiasm.

The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of optic neuritis, such as pain with eye movement or visual field defects. The patient also does not have any risk factors for anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, such as hypertension, diabetes, or atherosclerosis. The patient's skin rash is concerning for neuromyelitis optica, but the patient does not have any other symptoms of this condition, such as weakness or numbness in the arms or legs.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. This is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it is the diagnosis that remains after all other possible causes have been ruled out. The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. These tests will help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's optic nerve edema, such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and infectious diseases.

Title: An Unusual Cause of Intestinal Perforation Case is: A 52-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency department with gradual onset of severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain over the course of 24 hours. The patient did not have a fever and he was hemodynamically normal. Laboratory workup revealed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11 600/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant without overt signs of peritonitis. The patient reported undergoing an appendectomy when he was 10 years old. Abdominal computed tomography was obtained (Figure 1).Coronal computed tomography scan showing calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis (arrowhead).What Is Your Diagnosis? A: Stump appendicitis , B: Foreign body ingestion , C: Crohn ileitis , D: Carcinoid. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of appendectomy who presents with sudden-onset, severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain. On physical examination, there is tenderness in the right lower quadrant without overt signs of peritonitis. Laboratory workup reveals leukocytosis. Abdominal computed tomography shows calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis.

The most likely diagnosis is Crohn disease. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but is most commonly found in the ileum and colon. The disease is characterized by inflammation, ulceration, and fibrosis of the intestinal mucosa. Symptoms of Crohn disease can vary depending on the location of the disease, but may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and anemia.

The diagnosis of Crohn disease is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Imaging studies, such as abdominal computed tomography, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and identifying the extent of the disease. Treatment of Crohn disease is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing complications. Treatment options include medications, surgery, and dietary changes.

Title: Mobile Intramural Gastroesophageal Junction Mass Case is: A healthy 43-year-old woman presented with weight loss, heartburn, and progressively worsening dysphagia to solid food. Intriguingly, the heartburn was most severe while she was sitting up but lying supine relieved the symptoms. Paradoxically, dysphagia was worse while she was reclining and partially resolved in the upright position. The physical examination was normal while laboratory workup revealed mild anemia. She was administered a trial of acid-suppression therapy for 6 weeks, which transiently alleviated heartburn but the dysphagia persisted. Subsequently, further workup with an esophagram revealed a 2.7-cm filling defect at the gastroesophageal junction, suggestive of extrinsic compression. Computed tomography demonstrated a 2.5-cm low-attenuation ovoid lesion at the gastroesophageal junction (Figure 1A). Considering a diagnosis of gastric tumor, she then underwent upper endoscopy that showed a mobile smooth-surfaced polypoid subepithelial lesion at the posterolateral wall of the gastroesophageal junction. The mass flopped back and forth into the gastroesophageal junction. Mucosal biopsies were performed, which were consistent with normal squamous mucosal epithelium. Following this, endoscopic ultrasonography was performed, which demonstrated an anechoic, loculated, subepithelial lesion located within the submucosa of the distal esophagus (Figure 1B). The endosonographic borders were well defined without invasion into the nearby structures. Manometry and 24-hour pH testing revealed preserved motility but abnormal acid exposure of the distal esophagus. Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas revealed no abnormalities.Diagnostic imaging for the patient.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a healthy 43-year-old woman with a history of heartburn and dysphagia to solid food. She has no history of smoking or alcohol use. Her physical examination is normal. Laboratory workup reveals mild anemia. She was administered a trial of acid-suppression therapy for 6 weeks, which transiently alleviated heartburn but the dysphagia persisted. Subsequently, further workup with an esophagram revealed a 2.7-cm filling defect at the gastroesophageal junction, suggestive of extrinsic compression. Computed tomography demonstrated a 2.5-cm low-attenuation ovoid lesion at the gastroesophageal junction.

The endosonographic borders were well defined without invasion into the nearby structures. Manometry and 24-hour pH testing revealed preserved motility but abnormal acid exposure of the distal esophagus. Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas revealed no abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis is a **inclusion cyst**. Inclusion cysts are the most common type of benign esophageal lesion. They are typically small, asymptomatic, and found incidentally on imaging. They are thought to arise from inclusion of epithelial cells within the submucosa during embryogenesis. Inclusion cysts are usually lined by squamous epithelium and may contain mucus or keratin debris. They are typically unilocular and have smooth, well-defined borders. On endoscopic ultrasonography, inclusion cysts appear as anechoic, loculated lesions within the submucosa. They do not invade the muscularis propria or adjacent structures.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They are typically found in the stomach, but can also occur in the esophagus. GISTs are usually submucosal and may be polypoid or sessile. They are typically well-circumscribed and have a smooth surface. On endoscopic ultrasonography, GISTs appear as hypoechoic lesions with heterogeneous echotexture. They may invade the muscularis propria or adjacent structures.

Esophageal carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. It is the second most common cancer of the esophagus after adenocarcinoma. Esophageal carcinoma is typically diagnosed in older adults and is more common in men than women. Risk factors for esophageal carcinoma include smoking, alcohol use, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Esophageal carcinoma can present with dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, and chest pain. On imaging, esophageal carcinoma may appear as a mass, stricture, or ulceration. On endoscopic ultrasonography, esophageal carcinoma appears as an echogenic lesion with heterogeneous echotexture. It may invade the muscularis propria or adjacent structures.

Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital anomalies that arise from abnormal budding of the foregut. They are typically located in the mediastinum, but can also occur in the neck or abdomen. Bronchogenic cysts are usually unilocular and have a smooth, well-defined border. They are lined by respiratory epithelium and may contain mucus or air. On endoscopic ultrasonography, bronchogenic cysts appear as anechoic, loculated lesions within the submucosa. They do not invade the muscularis propria or adjacent structures.

Title: An Aggressive Mandibular Mass Case is: A woman in her 70s with a history of sarcoidosis presented with progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling of 3 months’ duration. She reported pain with chewing, which led to a 5-kg weight loss, but denied trismus. On examination, there was craniofacial deformity with left facial preauricular swelling. The left parotid was firm and a fixed mass was felt throughout the left preauricular space, expanding into the temporomandibular joint area and zygoma. Soft-mobile lymphadenopathy was palpable in the left neck, and a firm, adherent, immobile right supraclavicular mass extended under the clavicle. Cranial nerve examination findings were normal.Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck showed a 3.2 × 4.4 × 2.8-cm lobulated enhancing paramandibular mass extending into the left masticator space and infratemporal fossa, with frank erosion of the left mandibular condyle (Figure). Several enlarged lymph nodes were noted. Computed tomography of the chest showed a 4.6 × 3.2 × 3.5-cm supraclavicular mass with infiltration of the surrounding fat and scalene muscle and extension into the chest wall and axilla. Positron emission tomography showed a large metabolically active left masticator space mass (standardized uptake value for body weight at maximum counts per pixel [SUVmax], 18.2) and previously mentioned pathologic nodes. The right supraclavicular mass was also metabolically active (SUVmax, 19.4), and metabolically active right axillary, left mediastinal, and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy was also noted.A, Axial computed tomography of the head and neck showing a lobulated paramandibular mass (arrowhead).

The right supraclavicular mass was also metabolically active (SUVmax, 19.4), and metabolically active right axillary, left mediastinal, and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy was also noted.

The most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of all cases. It is a malignant tumor that arises from the squamous cells that line the surface of the skin, mouth, throat, and other organs. Squamous cell carcinoma is typically diagnosed in adults over the age of 50, and it is more common in men than in women. The risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include smoking, alcohol use, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

The clinical presentation of squamous cell carcinoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor. In the case of this patient, the tumor is located in the masticator space, which is a region of the face that contains the muscles used for chewing. The tumor is causing progressive swelling of the face and jaw, and it is also eroding the mandibular condyle. This is consistent with the imaging findings, which show a large, lobulated mass that is enhancing with contrast. The positron emission tomography scan shows that the mass is metabolically active, which is also consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

The treatment for squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, the tumor can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. In more advanced disease, a combination of these treatments may be necessary. The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer, or to control the disease and improve the patient's quality of life.

Reasoning:
The patient presents with a 2-year history of tingling and pain in his hands and feet, as well as near-complete loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, a scaly plaque on the right shin, and mild bilateral erythema of the earlobes, distal fingers, and toes. He also has right axillary and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. The differential diagnosis for this presentation includes a number of conditions, including leprosy, syphilis, thyroid disease, and lead poisoning.

Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and loss of sensation. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by a chancre at the site of infection, followed by a secondary stage with skin rash, lymphadenopathy, and fever. Thyroid disease can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, and dry skin. Lead poisoning is a toxic condition caused by exposure to lead. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation, headache, and irritability.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order laboratory tests to help narrow the differential diagnosis. These tests should include a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and a lead level. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis. The TSH level is a test of thyroid function. The lead level is a test for lead poisoning.

If the RPR test is positive, the patient should be treated for syphilis. If the TSH level is abnormal, the patient should be treated for thyroid disease. If the lead level is elevated, the patient should be treated for lead poisoning.

If the laboratory tests are negative, the next step is to perform a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

Reasoning:
The patient is a healthy woman in her 20s with a 5-month history of a painful erythematous eruption over her bilateral thighs. The eruption is worsening during the winter months and is associated with focal areas of ulceration. The patient has no fevers, chills, joint pains, recent weight loss, or any other constitutional symptoms. She is a nonsmoker and takes no medications. A review of her social history reveals that she is working at a horse stable and rides for many hours a day. On physical examination, there are several arcuate to circinate erythematous to violaceous plaques distributed over the bilateral posterior lateral thighs. There are also several focal areas of ulceration with overlying scale-crust. A biopsy was performed during this initial visit.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes erythema annulare centrifugum, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis, and equestrian perniosis. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a common skin condition characterized by erythematous annular plaques that expand centrifugally. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with fever, chills, and malaise. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by skin lesions that are often photosensitive. The lesions are typically erythematous papules and plaques that may be scaly or ulcerated. Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis is a rare skin condition characterized by erythematous papules and plaques that are often associated with fever, chills, and malaise. The lesions may be scaly or ulcerated. Equestrian perniosis is a condition that occurs in people who are exposed to cold and wet conditions. It is characterized by erythematous papules and plaques on the extremities.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is equestrian perniosis. This is supported by the patient's history of working at a horse stable and riding for many hours a day. The patient's physical examination findings are also consistent with equestrian perniosis. The biopsy findings are not specific for any one diagnosis, but they are not consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus or palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

Reasoning:
The patient is a man in his 50s with a 2-month medical history of painful, gradually expanding ulcers on the left lower leg. The lesions started spontaneously as erythematous tender papules with white purulent discharge. He recently failed a course of amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole initiated by his primary care physician. He reported a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and heavy tobacco use. The patient denied any recent changes to his medications or recent travel. No other household members were affected.

Physical examination of the left lower extremity revealed a 2.5-cm keratotic plaque with central ulceration that expressed a straw-colored fluid. The limb was dusky with scattered hyperpigmented patches and surrounding erythema. Both lower limbs exhibited pitting edema of 1+ severity, and negative Homans sign bilaterally for deep vein thrombosis. Fungal and bacterial culture samples were negative. Rheumatoid factor was elevated at 198 IU/mL, and other laboratory data were noncontributory. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained from the edge of the lesion.

The differential diagnosis for nonhealing lower leg ulcers includes a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. In this case, the patient's age, medical history, and physical examination findings are most consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, idiopathic, neutrophilic dermatosis that typically presents as painful, rapidly progressive ulcers. The lesions are often associated with underlying inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.

The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is usually made clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. However, a skin biopsy may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the ulcers. The treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is often challenging and may require a combination of systemic and topical medications. In some cases, surgical excision of the lesions may be necessary.

Title: Rash and Arthralgias in a Teenager With Autism Case is: A 16-year-old boy with autism presented with 4 weeks of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema, ecchymosis, and arthralgias severe enough to prevent ambulation. Associated symptoms included fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal discomfort, and intermittent scleral icterus noted by his mother. One week prior, a dentist diagnosed acute necrotizing gingivostomatitis based on gum inflammation and bleeding, prompting treatment with metronidazole and penicillin. There was no history of trauma, fevers, hematuria, or hematochezia or family history of coagulation disorders. His medical history was significant for seizures and behavioral disturbances managed with stable doses of lamotrigine and chlorpromazine. On physical examination, he was nonverbal but in no visible distress. There was hemorrhagic gingivitis (Figure, A) without cervical lymphadenopathy, and the bilateral lower extremities had marked asymmetric pitting edema, large ecchymoses on the thighs, ankles, and feet (Figure, B), and scattered petechiae (Figure, C). His lower extremities were tender to palpation and he resisted passive ranging of his joints.A, Markedly edematous and friable gingiva. B, Ecchymoses on the lateral ankle.

His lower extremities were tender to palpation and he resisted passive ranging of his joints.

The most likely diagnosis is Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). HSP is a small vessel vasculitis that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a triad of abdominal pain, arthralgias, and purpura. The purpura is usually palpable and typically occurs on the lower extremities. Other common findings include fever, arthralgias, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of HSP is usually made clinically, based on the characteristic findings. However, laboratory testing may be helpful to support the diagnosis. This may include a complete blood count, urinalysis, and stool studies. A biopsy of the skin or kidney may also be performed.

The treatment of HSP is usually supportive. This may include bed rest, fluids, and pain medication. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used. The prognosis for HSP is generally good. Most patients recover completely within a few weeks or months. However, some patients may experience long-term complications, such as kidney disease.

Title: Rapidly Growing, Bleeding Mass on a Golfer’s Back Case is: A previously healthy, fair-skinned professional golfer aged 69 years with a history of frequent outdoor sun exposure presented to the surgery clinic with a mass on his left upper back, which he first noted 1 year ago as a small nodule on his back. It grew rapidly throughout the past year, becoming increasingly painful and bleeding easily with light contact. Clinical examination revealed an 8 × 6 × 4-cm multilobulated, purplish lesion that was fungating and friable (Figure 1). He also had a palpable, hard mass in the left axilla. He had no other lesions elsewhere on his body. A punch biopsy of the back mass revealed immunohistochemistry strongly positive for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45. Computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scans demonstrated a fludeoxyglucose-avid lesion on the back extending into the subcutaneous fat and fludeoxyglucose-avid uptake in the left axilla.An 8 × 6 × 4-cm multilobulated, purplish lesion on the back that was fungating and friable.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of frequent outdoor sun exposure who presents with a rapidly growing, bleeding mass on his left upper back. The lesion is described as multilobulated, purplish, fungating, and friable. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of nodular melanoma.

Nodular melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis. It is the most aggressive form of melanoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. The most common presenting symptom of nodular melanoma is a change in the appearance of a mole. The mole may become larger, darker, or asymmetrical. It may also bleed or ulcerate.

The diagnosis of nodular melanoma is made on the basis of a biopsy. The biopsy will show the presence of atypical melanocytes, which are cells that have undergone malignant transformation.

The treatment of nodular melanoma depends on the stage of the disease. Early-stage nodular melanoma can be treated with surgery. More advanced nodular melanoma may require a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Title: A Woman With Progressive Dyspnea and Fatigue Case is: A woman aged 44 years with no significant medical history presented with increasing exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an atrial septal defect, and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a 1.2-cm secundum atrial septal defect with bidirectional shunting without a clear superior rim. A computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiogram showed a dilated pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension (Figure 1A).A, Computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiogram showing a dilated pulmonary artery size in compare to the aorta size. B, Coronary angiogram revealing diffuse narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin.Right and left heart cardiac catheterization was performed. During coronary angiography, the patient was noted to have diffuse 90% to 95% narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin (Figure 1B; Video). The left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries were normal in caliber and appearance.The question arose whether the left main coronary artery stenosis represented an anatomic anomaly, a spasm, or a combination. Intracoronary nitroglycerine was administered with no change in angiographic appearance of the left main coronary artery. The patient then developed deep ST-segment depressions associated with chest and throat pain. The catheter was re-engaged, and additional intracoronary nitroglycerine was administered with the resolution of ST-segment depression and pain.The patient then developed ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient became unstable with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An intra-aortic balloon pump was emergently placed, and the patient was intubated.Emergent stenting of the left main coronary arteryEmergent closure of the atrial septal defect What Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a diffuse 90% to 95% narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin, which is a life-threatening condition. The left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries are normal in caliber and appearance, suggesting that the left main coronary artery stenosis is an anatomic anomaly rather than a spasm. Intracoronary nitroglycerine was administered with no change in angiographic appearance of the left main coronary artery, and the patient then developed deep ST-segment depressions associated with chest and throat pain. This suggests that the left main coronary artery stenosis is causing ischemia of the left ventricle. The patient then developed ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient became unstable with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An intra-aortic balloon pump was emergently placed, and the patient was intubated.

The next step in management is to restore blood flow to the left ventricle by stenting the left main coronary artery. This can be done with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon-tipped catheter into the narrowed coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. A stent, which is a small metal mesh tube, is then placed in the artery to keep it open.

Answer: B. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery
B
api request failed
**Reasoning:**
The patient has a diffuse 90% to 95% narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The goal of treatment is to restore blood flow to the left main coronary artery and prevent further damage to the heart muscle.

There are two main options for treatment: emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery. CABG is a surgical procedure in which a blood vessel is taken from another part of the body and used to bypass the narrowed section of the left main coronary artery. Stenting is a minimally invasive procedure in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into the narrowed section of the left main coronary artery and inflated. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.

In this case, I would recommend emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery. This is because stenting is a less invasive procedure and can be performed more quickly than CABG. Additionally, the patient is at high risk for bleeding and other complications from CABG.

**Answer:**
B. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery
B
api request failed
Reasoning: The patient has a left main coronary artery stenosis, which is a life-threatening condition. The left main coronary artery supplies blood to the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart. If the left main coronary artery is blocked, the left ventricle will not receive enough blood and will start to fail. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.

The patient has already developed ventricular tachycardia, which is a rapid heart rhythm that can be life-threatening. She has also required cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine, which are medications used to treat ventricular tachycardia. These medications have not been successful in controlling her ventricular tachycardia, and she is at risk of developing further complications, such as heart failure or sudden death.

The only way to treat the patient's left main coronary artery stenosis is to open the artery. This can be done with either coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). CABG involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the narrowed section of the left main coronary artery. PCI involves inserting a balloon into the narrowed section of the left main coronary artery and inflating it to open the artery.

In this case, PCI is the preferred treatment option. This is because PCI is a less invasive procedure than CABG, and it has been shown to be just as effective in treating left main coronary artery stenosis. In addition, PCI can be performed on an emergency basis, while CABG requires more time to schedule and prepare for.

Flexible laryngoscopy was performed, which showed hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis with normal vocal fold movement and complete glottic closure.

The most likely diagnosis is a hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. This is supported by the patient's history of a sudden voice change, odynophagia, and neck pain following a single sneeze. The physical examination findings of tenderness over the thyroid notch and left side of the laryngotracheal complex are also consistent with this diagnosis. The flexible laryngoscopy findings of a hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis with normal vocal fold movement and complete glottic closure provide further evidence for this diagnosis.

Other possible diagnoses include a ruptured vocal fold hemangioma, a ruptured laryngocele, a thyroid cartilage fracture, and traumatic intubation. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and flexible laryngoscopy findings.

The most likely diagnosis is a hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. This is supported by the patient's history of a sudden voice change, odynophagia, and left-sided neck pain following a single sneeze. The patient also experienced a popping sensation during the sneeze followed by neck stiffness 15 minutes later. This suggests that the patient may have sustained a vocal fold injury during the sneeze. On physical examination, the patient's voice was rough and without stridor. Anterior neck examination revealed tenderness over the thyroid notch and left side of the laryngotracheal complex. There was no palpable crepitus. Flexible laryngoscopy showed hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis with normal vocal fold movement and complete glottic closure.

A ruptured vocal fold hemangioma is a less likely diagnosis. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that can occur in the vocal folds. They are usually asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause a hoarse voice. Rupture of a hemangioma is rare and would not typically present with the symptoms that the patient described.

A ruptured laryngocele is also a less likely diagnosis. Laryngoceles are air-filled sacs that can develop in the larynx. They are usually asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause a hoarse voice. Rupture of a laryngocele is rare and would not typically present with the symptoms that the patient described.

A thyroid cartilage fracture is a less likely diagnosis. Thyroid cartilage fractures are usually caused by blunt trauma to the neck. They can cause hoarseness, stridor, and pain. The patient in this case did not have any history of trauma, and his physical examination was not consistent with a thyroid cartilage fracture.

Traumatic intubation is also a less likely diagnosis. Traumatic intubation can cause hoarseness, stridor, and pain. The patient in this case did not have any history of intubation, and his physical examination was not consistent with traumatic intubation.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is a hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and flexible laryngoscopy findings.

Title: Incidental Finding in a Man With Objective Tinnitus Case is: A man in his 30s presented with a 1-year history of recurrent episodes of unilateral high-pitched “clicking” in his right ear followed by vertigo that lasted 3 to 4 seconds. He reported no perceived association between these episodes and breathing and head position, and denied precipitation of symptoms with exposure to loud sound or pressure change. He had not experienced hearing loss, aural fullness, autophony, or headache. On physical examination, objective, intermittent, clicking tinnitus at a frequency of 1 click per second was noted on placement of a stethoscope in close proximity to the right ear. The tinnitus coincided temporally with the patient’s complaints but was nonsynchronous with pulse. Results from prior imaging including a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head with multiplanar reconstruction (Figure, A, C, and D), were normal. Steady state tympanometry showed mildly decreased compliance of the tympanic membrane when the patient reported hearing the clicking sensation. The patient was tentatively diagnosed as having tensor tympani and stapedius myoclonus and after discussion of treatment options, he decided to undergo middle ear exploration for muscle sectioning.

The patient was tentatively diagnosed as having tensor tympani and stapedius myoclonus and after discussion of treatment options, he decided to undergo middle ear exploration for muscle sectioning. The incidental findings observed during middle ear exploration are shown in the Figure, B.

The incidental findings observed during middle ear exploration are a persistent stapedial artery (PSA) and a dehiscent carotid canal. A PSA is a rare congenital anomaly in which the stapedial artery, which normally regresses in utero, persists into adulthood. A dehiscent carotid canal is a condition in which the bony wall of the carotid canal is thin or absent, allowing the carotid artery to be in direct contact with the middle ear.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a PSA. The patient's history of recurrent episodes of unilateral high-pitched “clicking” in his right ear followed by vertigo that lasted 3 to 4 seconds is consistent with a PSA. The clicking sound is caused by the blood flow through the persistent artery, and the vertigo is caused by the artery irritating the vestibular nerve. The CT scan showed a normal appearance of the middle ear, which is consistent with a PSA. The intraoperative findings of a PSA and a dehiscent carotid canal are also consistent with the patient's history and symptoms.

Reasoning:

The patient is a woman in her 70s with a cervical tracheal mass measuring 1.6 × 1.3 cm found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging for cervical spine pain. She had not experienced dyspnea, hoarseness, dysphagia, hemoptysis, or chest pain. Flexible fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy demonstrated a smooth hypervascular mass arising from the posterior membranous trachea. The patient underwent tracheostomy and complete excision via a transtracheal approach. The patient was decannulated on postoperative day 5. Histopathologic images are shown in the Figure, B-D.

The most likely diagnosis is a superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma. Schwannomas are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor, and they most often arise from the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They can occur anywhere along the nerve, but they are most common in the head and neck. Schwannomas are typically benign tumors, but they can be locally aggressive.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with a superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma. The mass is located in the cervical trachea, which is the region innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve. The patient has not experienced any symptoms of airway obstruction or cranial nerve dysfunction, which are also consistent with a benign tumor.

The histopathologic images show a well-circumscribed tumor composed of spindle cells arranged in a Antoni A and Antoni B pattern. The Antoni A pattern is characterized by densely packed spindle cells, while the Antoni B pattern is characterized by loose, myxoid stroma. These findings are typical of a schwannoma.

The differential diagnosis for a cervical tracheal mass includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. The most common benign tumors include schwannomas, paragangliomas, and glomus tumors. The most common malignant tumors include tracheal carcinomas and sarcomas.

In the case of this patient, the diagnosis of a superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma is supported by the patient's history, presentation, and histopathologic findings.

Title: An Unusual Cause of Anemia and Positive Fecal Occult Blood Test Screening Case is: A man in his 70s with long-standing diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure presented with edema of the right lower leg and suspected venous thrombosis (which was not confirmed by subsequent Doppler ultrasonography). Blood tests revealed serious iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.6 g/d [86 g/L]) and a positive result for a fecal occult blood test. His appetite was intact; he had not lost weight; and no dysphagia, stomach pain, or stool irregularity was reported. Initially, we performed an upper endoscopy that revealed normal esophageal mucosa with folding of the posterior esophageal wall through the entire length of the esophagus. Distal ending of the folding was not clearly seen in forward viewing, but in retroflexion, a necrotic polypoid lesion was observed protruding from the esophagogastric junction. A computed tomographic scan of the chest with oral contrast revealed an esophageal intraluminal tubular mass of soft-tissue density, about 15 mm in diameter originating just below the pyriform recessus and extending through the esophagus in the stomach lumen for about 20 mm (Figure 1). The patient was referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist who performed esophagoscopy of the hypopharynx with the patient under endotracheal anesthesia.Intraluminal tubular mass extending through the entire esophagus.

**Reasoning:**

The patient is a man in his 70s with long-standing diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. He presents with edema of the right lower leg and suspected venous thrombosis, but this is not confirmed by subsequent Doppler ultrasonography. Blood tests reveal serious iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin level, 8.6 g/d [86 g/L]) and a positive result for a fecal occult blood test. His appetite is intact; he has not lost weight; and no dysphagia, stomach pain, or stool irregularity was reported. Initially, an upper endoscopy was performed that revealed normal esophageal mucosa with folding of the posterior esophageal wall through the entire length of the esophagus. Distal ending of the folding was not clearly seen in forward viewing, but in retroflexion, a necrotic polypoid lesion was observed protruding from the esophagogastric junction. A computed tomographic scan of the chest with oral contrast revealed an esophageal intraluminal tubular mass of soft-tissue density, about 15 mm in diameter originating just below the pyriform recessus and extending through the esophagus in the stomach lumen for about 20 mm. The patient was referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist who performed esophagoscopy of the hypopharynx with the patient under endotracheal anesthesia.

The most likely diagnosis is a **fibrovascular polyp**. This is a benign tumor that is thought to arise from the submucosa of the esophagus. It is typically small, pedunculated, and smooth surfaced. On histologic examination, it is composed of a mixture of fibrous and vascular tissue.

Other possible diagnoses include a **squamous papilloma**, a **gastrointestinal stromal tumor** (GIST), and a **lipoma**. Squamous papillomas are also benign tumors, but they are typically smaller and more superficial than fibrovascular polyps. GISTs are malignant tumors that arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract that function as pacemaker cells. Lipomas are benign tumors that are composed of fat.

The clinical presentation of the patient is most consistent with a fibrovascular polyp. The patient is an older man with multiple medical comorbidities, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. These conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing fibrovascular polyps. The patient also has a history of iron deficiency anemia, which is a common finding in patients with fibrovascular polyps. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with a fibrovascular polyp. The patient has no dysphagia, stomach pain, or stool irregularity. These symptoms are more commonly associated with other types of esophageal tumors, such as GISTs.

The imaging findings are also consistent with a fibrovascular polyp. The CT scan shows an esophageal intraluminal tubular mass of soft-tissue density, about 15 mm in diameter originating just below the pyriform recessus and extending through the esophagus in the stomach lumen for about 20 mm. This is the typical appearance of a fibrovascular polyp.

The endoscopic findings are also consistent with a fibrovascular polyp. The endoscopist observed a necrotic polypoid lesion protruding from the esophagogastric junction. This is a common finding in patients with fibrovascular polyps.

The patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, imaging findings, and endoscopic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of a fibrovascular polyp. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a fibrovascular polyp.

**Answer:** C. Fibrovascular polyp

Title: An Unusual Cause of Unilateral Vision Loss Case is: A 64-year-old man was referred to our clinic for suspected central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye. He had experienced blurred vision of the right eye for 2 months; medical history included hypercholesterolemia. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. The anterior segment was normal and intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye revealed a normal optic disc, mild venous engorgement, and widespread peripheral dot-blot retinal hemorrhages mainly located in the temporal midperiphery (Figure 1A). No spontaneous retinal arterial pulsation was noted. Examination findings of the left eye were unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography in the right eye showed delayed venous filling, mild perifoveal leakage, and scattered microaneurysms in the temporal sector (Figure 1B).A, Montage color fundus photograph of the right eye at presentation shows mild venous dilation and midperipheral dot and blot hemorrhages mostly located in the temporal sectors. B, Fluorescein angiography frame (2 minutes, 3 seconds) shows multiple microaneurysms in correspondence of the dot-blot retinal hemorrhages and a barely visible perifoveal vascular leakage.What Would You Do Next? A: Observe , B: Perform panretinal photocoagulation , C: Obtain carotid Doppler , D: Refer to cardiology. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and presents with blurred vision in the right eye for 2 months. On examination, he has a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in the right eye. CRVO is a common retinal vascular occlusion that occurs when there is a blockage of the central retinal vein, which carries blood from the retina to the optic nerve. This blockage can lead to ischemia (lack of oxygen) and infarction (death of tissue) of the retina.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/80 OD, which is a significant decrease from his previous visual acuity of 20/20. This suggests that the CRVO has caused significant damage to the retina. The patient also has mild venous engorgement, widespread peripheral dot-blot retinal hemorrhages, and no spontaneous retinal arterial pulsation. These findings are consistent with a CRVO.

The patient's medical history is also significant for hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which can lead to stroke. A stroke is a sudden loss of blood flow to the brain, which can cause permanent damage to the brain and vision.

The patient's examination findings and medical history suggest that he has a CRVO that is secondary to a cardiovascular event, such as a stroke. The patient should be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Title: Recent-Onset Bilateral Blurred Vision Case is: An African American woman in her 50s presented for recent-onset blurred vision in both eyes for 2 months. She endorsed mild photophobia but denied pain, redness, tearing, or discharge. There was no history of oral/genital ulcers, rashes, or atopy. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, asthma, hepatitis C, and essential tremor. Her medications include lisinopril, albuterol sulfate, and amantadine hydrochloride. She denied any previous ocular surgical procedures or trauma. She was seen 2 weeks prior and was treated with 400 mg of oral acyclovir sodium 5 times a day and sodium chloride, 5%, ointment 4 times a day. Her central corneal thickness at that time was recorded at 798 μm OD and 827 μm OS.Her best-corrected visual acuity at presentation was 20/70 OD and 20/50 OS. Her extraocular motility, pupils, and confrontation visual fields were normal. Intraocular pressures were 7 and 9 mm Hg OD and OS, respectively. An anterior segment slitlamp examination was significant for central bilateral stromal edema, Descemet folds, microcystic edema, and endothelial guttae in both eyes (Figure). There were no keratic precipitates, and the anterior chamber did not show cells or flare. Conjunctiva was white and quiet. No abnormalities were noted during an ophthalmoscopic examination. Her central corneal thickness was found to be 833 μm OD and 925 μm OS.Slitlamp photograph at presentation showing corneal edema in the left eye. Corneal edema was similar in both eyes.What Would You Do Next? A: Bilateral Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty , B: Corneal topography , C: Observe , D: Discontinue treatment with amantadine. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has bilateral corneal edema, Descemet folds, microcystic edema, and endothelial guttae. These findings are consistent with Fuchs' dystrophy, a degenerative disorder of the corneal endothelium. The most common treatment for Fuchs' dystrophy is Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), which involves removing the diseased endothelial cells and replacing them with healthy donor cells. However, DSEK is a major surgery with a significant risk of complications. In this case, the patient's symptoms are mild and her vision is not severely impaired. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe the patient for a period of time to see if her condition stabilizes or worsens. If her condition worsens, then DSEK could be considered.

Title: Periorbital Mass Refractory to Outpatient Management Case is: A Hispanic woman in her 60s presented to the oculoplastics clinic with a 1-week history of pain, redness, and swelling in the medial aspect of the right periorbital region. Her medical history included sarcoidosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Her ocular history included pseudophakia and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes; she had also undergone pars plana vitrectomy and panretinal photocoagulation in both eyes. Seven days prior to presentation, an ophthalmologist prescribed the patient oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, 500 mg 3 times daily, and topical antibiotics. However, her symptoms persisted and eventually worsened. She reported increasing swelling and pain in the affected region. She denied changes in vision, eye pain, or pain with eye movements. The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/50 OS, her pupils were reactive, extraocular motility was full and painless, and intraocular pressures were 18 mm Hg in both eyes. External examination revealed an erythematous, tender, firm mass in the medial periorbital area (Figure, A). Results of anterior slitlamp examination and dilated fundus examination were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic imaging of the maxillofacial region was performed and showed a peripherally enhancing mass in the affected area (Figure, B).A, External photograph demonstrating a firm, tender, erythematous mass located in the medial periorbital area.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a Hispanic woman in her 60s with a history of sarcoidosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She presented with a 1-week history of pain, redness, and swelling in the medial aspect of the right periorbital region. Her symptoms persisted and eventually worsened, despite treatment with oral and topical antibiotics. External examination revealed an erythematous, tender, firm mass in the medial periorbital area. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic imaging of the maxillofacial region showed a peripherally enhancing mass in the affected area.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes a variety of conditions, including cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, dacryocystitis, and periorbital abscess. However, the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the presence of a peripherally enhancing mass on computed tomography imaging suggest that she may have a more serious condition, such as a neoplasm.

In order to further evaluate the patient and determine the underlying cause of her symptoms, I would recommend performing a biopsy of the mass. This will allow me to obtain a tissue sample for pathological examination, which can help me to make a definitive diagnosis.

Title: Vision Loss in a Teenage Girl With Postconcussion Syndrome Case is: A girl in her teens with a history of postconcussion syndrome was referred for retinal evaluation after failing her vision examination for her learner's permit for driving. She complained of progressively declining, blurred vision for 2 years. She denied floaters, flashes of light, headaches, and eye pain. The patient had a concussion 1 year prior after becoming dehydrated during marching band practice, fainting, and hitting her head on pavement. Her postconcussion symptoms included headaches, dizziness, and dysarthria. The headaches and dizziness resolved but the dysarthria remained. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within the last year was normal. She denied acute vision changes after the concussion. Family history was unremarkable for vision loss, glaucoma, inherited retinal degeneration, and autoimmune disease.Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/80 OU. Ishihara testing revealed red-green color deficiency bilaterally. Intraocular pressures, extraocular motility, confrontational visual fields, and pupils were normal. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopic examination demonstrated mild mottled retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities bilaterally (Figure, A).Right eye multicolor fundus image and retinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). A, Multicolor fundus image demonstrates mild macular mottling. The optic disc and retinal vessels are unremarkable. B, Retinal SD-OCT shows normal foveal contour with disruption and loss of the interdigitation and ellipsoid zones subfoveally.Fundus autofluorescence showed bilateral mild macular hyperautofluorescence likely within normal range without evidence of flecks. Retinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography demonstrated bilateral disruption of the interdigitation and ellipsoid zones subfoveally (Figure, B). Electroretinogram (ERG) revealed delayed and decreased amplitude responses to 30-Hz flicker with normal dark-adapted responses. Goldmann visual field testing showed mild bilateral nasal constriction.Two months after presentation, the patient returned with new balance difficulties and worsening dysarthria. Horizontal and vertical saccades were markedly slowed bilaterally.What Would You Do Next? A: MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast , B: Genetic testing , C: Lumbar puncture , D: Audiogram.

**Reasoning:** The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for a demyelinating disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic, autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The most common symptoms of MS are fatigue, numbness, tingling, weakness, vision problems, and problems with balance and coordination.

The patient's vision loss is likely due to optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis is a common symptom of MS, and it is often the first symptom that people experience. The patient's other symptoms, such as balance difficulties and worsening dysarthria, are also consistent with MS.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order an MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast. An MRI can help to detect lesions in the CNS that are characteristic of MS. Genetic testing and lumbar puncture are not necessary at this time. Audiogram is not indicated in this patient.

Title: New Yellow Plaques in a Patient Taking Pembrolizumab Case is: A woman in her 70s presented with a new 4-cm left upper lobe lung mass with hilar lymphadenopathy. Biopsy results demonstrated a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, and chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel for stage 3A disease was initiated. An allergic reaction prompted a change to cisplatin-etoposide, which continued as adjuvant chemotherapy after the radiation was complete. At first restaging, a recurrence of disease in the lung was detected, which was treated with cisplatin and gemcitabine for 4 months before she enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT02009449) in which she received combination therapy with pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg intravenously for 21 days, and an investigational agent, AM0010 (pegylated recombinant human interleukin-10), 10 μg/kg subcutaneously on days 1 through 14 of the 21-day cycle. Three months into treatment, she developed multiple thick, mildly pruritic, yellow hyperkeratotic plaques on her lower extremities (Figure, A). A referral to a dermatology expert was initiated.A, Clinical image showing representative plaque on left leg of patient on initial presentation.

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case is a woman in her 70s who has a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. She has been treated with chemoradiotherapy, cisplatin-etoposide, cisplatin and gemcitabine, and pembrolizumab. Three months into treatment with pembrolizumab, she developed multiple thick, mildly pruritic, yellow hyperkeratotic plaques on her lower extremities.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **hypertrophic lichen planus**. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can present with a variety of lesions, including papules, plaques, and erosive or bullous lesions. The lesions are typically pruritic and can be located anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the wrists, shins, and buccal mucosa. Histologically, lichen planus is characterized by a bandlike lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with lichen planus. The patient's plaques are located on the lower extremities, which is a common site for lichen planus lesions. The plaques are also mildly pruritic, which is also a common finding in lichen planus. The patient's biopsy shows a bandlike lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis, which is the classic histologic finding of lichen planus.

Other possible diagnoses for this patient include plaque psoriasis, keratoacanthoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that can present with a variety of lesions, including plaques, scales, and erythema. The lesions are typically pruritic and can be located anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the elbows, knees, scalp, and trunk. Histologically, plaque psoriasis is characterized by a thickened epidermis with parakeratosis, acanthosis, and Munro microabscesses.

Keratoacanthoma is a rare, rapidly growing skin tumor that can resemble a squamous cell carcinoma. The lesions are typically solitary and dome-shaped, with a central keratin plug. Histologically, keratoacanthoma is characterized by a well-circumscribed proliferation of keratinocytes with central keratinization.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can arise from the keratinocytes in the epidermis. The lesions can be superficial, invasive, or metastatic. Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes with keratinization.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of hypertrophic lichen planus. Other possible diagnoses, such as plaque psoriasis, keratoacanthoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, should be considered, but they are less likely.

Title: Repeat  Clostridium difficile  Testing Case is: A 28-year-old man presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea (10-12 Bristol type 7 stools per day; Bristol scale range, 1-7 [1, separate hard pieces; 7, watery stool])1 after completing a course of azithromycin for pneumonia. He was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with a positive stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the toxin B (tcdB) gene. Laboratory studies showed unremarkable results (Table 1). He was successfully treated with a 10-day course of oral metronidazole, and his bowel movement pattern returned to its baseline of 2 to 3 Bristol type 4 stools per day. Six weeks later, he presented with abdominal discomfort for 3 weeks relieved by bowel movements associated with increased stool frequency (4-5 Bristol type 4 stools per day). Vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable and a repeat stool test for C difficile toxin PCR was positive.Diagnose recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and prescribe metronidazole.Diagnose postinfectious altered bowel habits with C difficile colonization and recommend a high-fiber diet.Diagnose refractory CDI and consider fecal microbiota transplantation.What Would You Do Next? A: Diagnose recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and prescribe metronidazole. , B: Diagnose severe CDI and prescribe vancomycin. , C: Diagnose postinfectious altered bowel habits with C difficile colonization and recommend a high-fiber diet. , D: Diagnose refractory CDI and consider fecal microbiota transplantation.. Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient in this case has a history of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that was successfully treated with metronidazole. He now presents with abdominal discomfort and increased stool frequency 6 weeks after completing treatment. A repeat stool test for C difficile toxin PCR is positive. This suggests that the patient has recurrent CDI.

Recurrent CDI is defined as a second episode of CDI occurring within 8 weeks of the initial episode. It is estimated that 20-30% of patients with CDI will experience a recurrence. The risk of recurrence is increased in patients who have had multiple prior episodes of CDI, who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics, and who have underlying medical conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.

The treatment of recurrent CDI is similar to the treatment of the initial episode. Metronidazole is the first-line agent, followed by vancomycin or fidaxomicin if metronidazole is not effective. In patients who have recurrent CDI despite treatment with multiple antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be an option.

Title: Clusters of Painful Blue Papules Case is: A woman in her 30s presented with multiple discrete and clustered blue papules on her face and extremities. The lesions had been present since childhood, but the size of the lesions and the intensity of pain associated with them had recently increased with even light touch causing paroxysms of pain. The pain associated with these papules worsened as the day progressed, and she could not tolerate elastic compression due to excessive pain on compression. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed multiple discrete and agminated blue papules on the face, arms, hands, and thighs with a cobblestoned appearance (Figure 1). On palpation, the papules were exquisitely tender and partially compressible. The patient underwent duplex ultrasonography of representative papules on the thigh, and a skin biopsy specimen of a papule on the thigh was obtained for histopathologic evaluation.Clinically, multiple discrete and agminated blue papules are apparent, nodular, blue cutaneous lesions cobblestone-like in appearance, on the thigh (A) and hand and thigh (B).What Is Your Diagnosis?

**Reasoning:**

The patient in this case presents with multiple discrete and clustered blue papules on her face and extremities. The lesions have been present since childhood, but the size of the lesions and the intensity of pain associated with them have recently increased. The pain associated with these papules worsens as the day progresses, and she cannot tolerate elastic compression due to excessive pain on compression. Her medical and family histories are unremarkable. Physical examination reveals multiple discrete and agminated blue papules on the face, arms, hands, and thighs with a cobblestoned appearance. On palpation, the papules are exquisitely tender and partially compressible. The patient underwent duplex ultrasonography of representative papules on the thigh, and a skin biopsy specimen of a papule on the thigh was obtained for histopathologic evaluation.

The clinical presentation of this patient is most consistent with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS). BRBNS is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by the presence of multiple blue papules and nodules on the skin. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities, but they can also be found on the face and mucous membranes. The papules are caused by abnormal proliferation of blood vessels in the skin, and they can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. The lesions are often painful, and they can bleed easily. In some cases, BRBNS can also be associated with other systemic abnormalities, such as hemangiomas, vascular malformations, and neurological problems.

The diagnosis of BRBNS is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy specimen typically shows a proliferation of capillaries and venules in the dermis. There is no specific treatment for BRBNS, but the lesions can be treated with a variety of methods, including laser therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery. The goal of treatment is to reduce the pain and bleeding associated with the lesions, and to improve the cosmetic appearance of the skin.

Title: Facial Erythematous Papules in a Young Woman Case is: A woman in her 20s presented to our department for treatment of multiple facial papules. The lesions were present since childhood, progressively increasing in number. They involved primarily her face, and, less so, her extremities and trunk. There was no medical history of spontaneous regression. She had a young brother, who had the same papular lesions that had followed the same natural history, displaying a similar bodily distribution although fewer in number. Previous studies and imaging of the 2 siblings had failed to reveal any systemic findings.Physical examination revealed multiple smooth skin-colored and erythematous papules of various size, some with telangiectasia, with a medial but asymmetrical distribution on the face (Figure, A). Identical, less numerous lesions were also present on her hands and back. Three biopsy samples were taken and showed similar findings (Figure, B-D).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**
The patient in this case presents with multiple facial papules that have been present since childhood and have progressively increased in number. The lesions are skin-colored to erythematous and have a medial but asymmetrical distribution on the face. The patient also has a brother who has the same papular lesions. Previous studies and imaging of the 2 siblings have failed to reveal any systemic findings.

Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD). BHD is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign skin tumors, including fibrofolliculomas, acrochordons, and trichodiscomas. Patients with BHD are also at increased risk for developing renal cell carcinoma and other neoplasms.

The histopathologic findings in BHD are characteristic. Biopsies of the patient's lesions show a proliferation of mucin-containing cells in the dermis. These cells are positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and negative for S-100 protein.

The differential diagnosis for BHD includes hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis (HPMH), multiple eruptive dermatofibromas (MED), and acral persistent papular mucinosis (APPM). HPMH is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the development of multiple mucin-containing tumors throughout the body. MED is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple eruptive dermatofibromas, which are benign tumors of the skin. APPM is a rare, idiopathic disorder characterized by the development of multiple papules on the hands and feet.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of BHD. The patient's brother's history of similar lesions further supports this diagnosis. Other possible diagnoses, such as HPMH, MED, and APPM, are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination.

Title: Painful Chronic Ulcers on the Neck and Back Case is: A man in his 60s who was a former smoker with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and cervical myelopathy experienced low-grade fevers, unintentional 80-pound weight loss, productive cough, and development of cutaneous ulcers over a 6-month period after cervical spine fusion. Two ulcers developed at the surgical site, and 2 similar ulcers developed on his back shortly after cyst excision. He had been recently diagnosed with lung cancer based on computed tomographic (CT) and positron emission tomographic imaging showing an enhancing, hypermetabolic, 7-cm cavitary right upper lobe mass with mediastinal adenopathy. A chest x-ray 6 months prior revealed negative results. A few days after establishing care, he presented to the emergency department with extreme weakness and intolerable pain related to his ulcers. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing man. In the right upper lobe, there were decreased breath sounds with clear auscultation in the remaining chest. On the right anterior neck were two, 3- to 4-cm tender ulcers extending to the deep subcutaneous fat with erythematous, friable borders (Figure). On his back were 2 similar 2- to 2.5-cm ulcers. Inflammatory markers were notably elevated. A complete autoimmune panel, indirect immunofluorescence assays, enzyme immunoassays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA)/proteinase 3, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody/myeloperoxidase, a quantiferon gold test, cultures of blood, broncheoalveolar washings, and tissue analysis were performed. Only c-ANCA testing revealed positive results. A CT scan of the sinus showed multiple bony defects and acute and chronic sinusitis.

Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing man. In the right upper lobe, there were decreased breath sounds with clear auscultation in the remaining chest. On the right anterior neck were two, 3- to 4-cm tender ulcers extending to the deep subcutaneous fat with erythematous, friable borders. On his back were 2 similar 2- to 2.5-cm ulcers. Inflammatory markers were notably elevated. A complete autoimmune panel, indirect immunofluorescence assays, enzyme immunoassays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA)/proteinase 3, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody/myeloperoxidase, a quantiferon gold test, cultures of blood, broncheoalveolar washings, and tissue analysis were performed. Only c-ANCA testing revealed positive results. A CT scan of the sinus showed multiple bony defects and acute and chronic sinusitis. A transbronchial biopsy of the lung and excisional biopsy of the skin bridge between back ulcers were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, sinuses, and skin. The patient's history of lung cancer is a risk factor for GPA, and his presentation with fevers, weight loss, productive cough, and cutaneous ulcers is consistent with the diagnosis. The positive c-ANCA test is also supportive of GPA. The CT scan of the sinuses shows evidence of chronic sinusitis, which is a common finding in patients with GPA. The transbronchial biopsy of the lung shows granulomatous inflammation, which is another characteristic finding of GPA. The excisional biopsy of the skin bridge between back ulcers shows necrotizing vasculitis, which is the hallmark of GPA.

Other possible diagnoses include disseminated tuberculosis, paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum, and disseminated nocardiosis. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Title: Acute Neck Pain Progressing to Hemiparesis With Brain and Spinal Cord Lesions Case is: A man in his 50s presented with weakness in the distal right hand and leg and paresthesias of the right hand. Four days before presentation, he experienced sudden, severe neck pain that swiftly progressed to neck stiffness and bilateral shoulder pain. The next day, he noticed weakness in the right arm and leg. The day before hospitalization, the weakness progressed, and he lost the ability to ambulate. Until 18 months ago, he had worked as a clerk, but he retired because of a history of hypertension and diabetes. His family history revealed no neurological disorders, except for a brother who had a brain lesion excised. On examination, he was afebrile, and his vital signs were normal. He was fully alert but had weakness in the right distal arm (medical research council [MRC] grade 3/5) and the right leg (MRC grade 4/5) with sensory impairment to pinprick and temperature in the left leg. Laboratory values revealed an elevated γ-glutamyltransferase level of 615 U/L (reference range, 10-71 U/L). Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid indicated xanthochromia; normal white blood cell count, 1 cell/µL; red blood cell count, 2.19 × 10/μL; increased glucose level at 133 mg/dL (reference range, 40-80 mg/dL); increased total protein level at 0.10 g/dL (reference range, 0.03-0.05 mg/dL); and increased lactate level at 28.8 mg/dL (reference range, 9.9-21.6 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and the entire spinal cord revealed patency of the intracranial vessels and multiple abnormal signals throughout the brain on T1-, T2-, and susceptibility-weighted sequences (SWIs) and 1 lesion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra (Figure).A, Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) showing numerous intraparenchymal hypointensities (red arrowheads).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of sudden, severe neck pain that swiftly progressed to neck stiffness and bilateral shoulder pain, followed by weakness in the right arm and leg and paresthesias of the right hand, is consistent with a diagnosis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The patient's family history of a brother who had a brain lesion excised is also consistent with CADASIL.

CADASIL is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the small blood vessels in the brain. It is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, which codes for a protein that is important for the development and function of blood vessels. The mutation leads to the formation of abnormal blood vessels, which can rupture or leak, causing strokes. CADASIL can also cause white matter lesions in the brain, which can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, and personality changes.

The diagnosis of CADASIL is made based on a patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. MRI of the brain can show the characteristic white matter lesions. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for CADASIL, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These include medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol, and physical therapy to help with balance and coordination.

Title: Clustered Papulovesicles in a Fully Vaccinated Child Case is: An 18-month-old boy presented to the emergency department with a rash on the left lower extremity. He was fully vaccinated, with routine vaccines at 12 months of age administered in the left thigh. The influenza vaccine was administered 1 week prior to presentation in the left buttock, after which his parents noted a red patch near the site of vaccination. The patch became raised and spread down the left thigh over the course of several days. The rash did not bleed, ulcerate, weep, or appear itchy or painful, though the patient did seem uncomfortable when getting dressed. He had no known sick contacts at day care, exposure to  herpes simplex virus, or exposure to new topical products or clothing. His pediatrician prescribed cephalexin and mupirocin for a presumed cutaneous bacterial infection. The eruption continued to spread down his left thigh over the next 2 days, at which point the pediatrician advised the family to go to the emergency department.On examination, the boy was afebrile and well-appearing. There were multiple discrete clusters of monomorphic pink to violaceous papulovesicles with surrounding erythema scattered across the left buttock, thigh, and upper calf, some with central punctate hemorrhagic crust (Figure). The lesions were nontender. There were no skin lesions elsewhere. A test was performed.Discrete clusters of monomorphic pink to violaceous papulovesicles with surrounding erythema.What Is Your Diagnosis?

The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is eczema herpeticum, a secondary infection of eczema with herpes simplex virus. This is a common and serious complication of eczema, and it is important to recognize it early and treat it appropriately. The characteristic rash of eczema herpeticum is a cluster of papulovesicles on erythematous skin. The lesions are often pruritic and painful, and they can become secondarily infected with bacteria. Eczema herpeticum is most common in children, and it is often associated with a recent viral illness, such as a cold or the flu. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but a viral culture or PCR test can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of eczema herpeticum includes antiviral therapy, such as acyclovir, and treatment of any secondary bacterial infection.

Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is eczema herpeticum, a secondary infection of eczema with herpes simplex virus. The patient has a history of eczema, and the rash began as a red patch near the site of a recent influenza vaccination. The rash then spread in a dermatomal distribution, which is characteristic of herpes zoster. However, the patient does not have any of the other typical symptoms of herpes zoster, such as fever, headache, or paresthesias. The rash is also nontender, which is unusual for herpes zoster. Additionally, the patient has no history of exposure to herpes simplex virus. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is eczema herpeticum.

Answer:
B. Eczema herpeticum
B
api request failed
Reasoning:
The most likely diagnosis is eczema herpeticum. This is a secondary infection of eczema with the herpes simplex virus. It is characterized by the sudden onset of clusters of small, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. The vesicles may be clear or cloudy and may rupture to form crusts. The lesions are often pruritic and painful.

Eczema herpeticum is most common in children under the age of 10. It is more common in children with atopic dermatitis. The risk of developing eczema herpeticum is increased in children who have recently been exposed to the herpes simplex virus, such as through contact with an infected person or through exposure to the virus in the environment.

The diagnosis of eczema herpeticum is made based on the clinical presentation. A skin biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of eczema herpeticum is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. The medications are taken orally for 7 to 10 days. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.

Title: A Massive Retroperitoneal Mass With Leukocytosis Case is: A man in his 30s presented to his primary care clinician after 2 years of worsening abdominal discomfort and an increasingly large recurrent umbilical hernia. He described early satiety but had no nausea or vomiting. He reported night sweats and a 9.1-kg weight loss over the prior 6 months. His medical history was unremarkable. His social history was notable for a 15-pack-year smoking history and consumption of 6 to 8 beers per night. He had no family history of malignant disease. On examination he had no fever, a reducible umbilical hernia, a palpable left-sided abdominal mass, and significant bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory evaluation revealed anemia for which the patient received several blood transfusions, leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 57 000/μL), and hyponatremia (sodium level, 128 mEq/L). He was first referred to the hematology service, and a blood smear showed 74% neutrophils. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed a hypercellular marrow with a myeloid left shift but no increase in blasts or dyspoiesis. Tests for BCR/ABL and peripheral blood JAK2 mutation were negative. Computed tomography revealed splenomegaly, hydronephrosis, and a 25-cm left-sided retroperitoneal mass (Figure). Surgical consultation was requested.Computed tomographic images.

Computed tomography reveals splenomegaly, hydronephrosis, and a 25-cm left-sided retroperitoneal mass.

The most likely diagnosis is **leiomyosarcoma**. Leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of smooth muscle cells. It can occur in any part of the body where smooth muscle is found, but it is most common in the uterus, abdomen, and retroperitoneum. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years, but it can occur at any age. The most common presenting symptom is a mass or abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma is made by biopsy. The treatment of leiomyosarcoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, surgery is the main treatment. In advanced-stage disease, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used.

The prognosis for leiomyosarcoma is variable. The overall 5-year survival rate is 50%. The prognosis is better for patients with early-stage disease and worse for patients with advanced-stage disease.

Title: Acute Upper Abdominal Pain With a Distended Cecum in the Left Upper Quadrant Case is: A woman in her 60s presented with acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain for 24 hours accompanied by nausea and retching. She had no significant medical history and no prior abdominal surgery. In the emergency department, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Results of her abdominal examination revealed a slight distension and diffuse tenderness to palpation, particularly in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant, but no peritoneal signs. Results of laboratory tests were unremarkable except for mild leukocytosis. Abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant (Figure 1).Computed tomographic images of a dilated cecum in the left upper quadrant (arrowhead).What Is Your Diagnosis?

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her 60s with acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain for 24 hours accompanied by nausea and retching. She had no significant medical history and no prior abdominal surgery. In the emergency department, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Results of her abdominal examination revealed a slight distension and diffuse tenderness to palpation, particularly in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant, but no peritoneal signs. Results of laboratory tests were unremarkable except for mild leukocytosis. Abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant.

The most likely diagnosis is cecal volvulus. Cecal volvulus is a twisting of the cecum, which is the lower part of the large intestine. This can cause obstruction of the cecum and ischemia of the bowel wall. The most common symptoms of cecal volvulus are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and distention. Cecal volvulus is a surgical emergency, and treatment is usually by surgery to reduce the volvulus and resect any necrotic bowel.

The other possible diagnoses are internal hernia of the cecum, intestinal malrotation, and midgut volvulus. Internal hernia of the cecum is a rare condition in which the cecum passes through a defect in the abdominal wall. Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly in which the intestines are not properly positioned in the abdomen. Midgut volvulus is a twisting of the midgut, which is the part of the small intestine that contains the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. All of these conditions can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and distention, but they are less common than cecal volvulus.

Title: Bilateral Hypopyons as a Presenting Symptom Case is: A 64-year-old man presented with 3 weeks of bilateral anterior uveitis unresponsive to treatment with topical steroids. He was referred to our clinic for worsening uveitis and ocular hypertension. The patient had no ocular history. His medical history was significant for 8 months of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck unresponsive to treatment with systemic antibiotics. He denied any constitutional symptoms. His visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/200 OS, and intraocular pressures were 17 and 32 mm Hg, respectively. On slitlamp examination, both eyes were markedly hyperemic with diffuse corneal stromal edema, and his anterior chambers were deep with 3+ OD and 4+ OS cell and mixed hypopyon and hyphema in each eye (Figure, A and B). His dilated fundus examination findings were remarkable only for an area of retinal pigment epithelial stippling inferonasal to the macula in the left eye, without any vitritis in either eye. He did not have any skin or mucocutaneous lesions, but he had extensive bilateral preauricular, submental, posterior occipital, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Gram stain and culture of aqueous and vitreous biopsy sample results were negative for infectious and cytologic studies, as were serum human leukocyte antigen B27, tuberculosis, syphilis, and sarcoidosis test results (Figure, C).Slitlamp examination findings of the left eye with hypopyon (A) and iris nodules (B).

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a history of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck unresponsive to treatment with systemic antibiotics. He also has bilateral anterior uveitis unresponsive to treatment with topical steroids. On slitlamp examination, both eyes are markedly hyperemic with diffuse corneal stromal edema, and his anterior chambers are deep with 3+ OD and 4+ OS cell and mixed hypopyon and hyphema in each eye. His dilated fundus examination findings are remarkable only for an area of retinal pigment epithelial stippling inferonasal to the macula in the left eye, without any vitritis in either eye. He does not have any skin or mucocutaneous lesions, but he has extensive bilateral preauricular, submental, posterior occipital, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Gram stain and culture of aqueous and vitreous biopsy sample results were negative for infectious and cytologic studies, as were serum human leukocyte antigen B27, tuberculosis, syphilis, and sarcoidosis test results.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes infectious uveitis, noninfectious uveitis, and systemic inflammatory disorders. Infectious uveitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Noninfectious uveitis can be caused by autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis. Systemic inflammatory disorders can also cause uveitis, as can medications, such as sulfa drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

In this patient, the history of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck suggests an underlying systemic inflammatory disorder, such as sarcoidosis. The presence of bilateral anterior uveitis unresponsive to treatment with topical steroids also supports this diagnosis. The negative Gram stain and culture of aqueous and vitreous biopsy sample results, as well as the negative serum human leukocyte antigen B27, tuberculosis, syphilis, and sarcoidosis test results, make an infectious cause less likely.

Therefore, the next step in management of this patient is to biopsy an iris nodule. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and determine the extent of the disease. If sarcoidosis is confirmed, the patient will be treated with corticosteroids and other medications to suppress the immune system.

Title: Pulmonary Edema Occurring 15 Years After Mitral Valve Replacement Case is: A 77-year-old man with a history of mitral valve replacement, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure presented to our clinic for evaluation of worsening exertional dyspnea. In 1998, he underwent mitral valve replacement with a St Jude mechanical prosthesis for severe mitral regurgitation owing to a flail leaflet, with 2-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. He reported compliance with warfarin therapy for many years.One year ago, he noted the onset of exertional dyspnea that culminated in multiple recurrent admissions for decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. While hospitalized, he underwent a cardiac catheterization that demonstrated patent bypass grafts but a profoundly low cardiac output and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed that suggested the presence of a significantly elevated gradient across his mitral prosthesis. A plain radiography of the chest demonstrated a mechanical prosthesis (Figure 1A). A transesophageal echocardiogram was then performed that demonstrated complete immobilization of 1 mechanical leaflet and impaired excursion of the other leaflet (Figure 1B), with subsequent severe mitral stenosis (Figure 1C) at a baseline heart rate of 82 bpm. He developed worsening hemodynamic instability and refractory pulmonary edema, and a TandemHeart left ventricular assist device was placed for cardiogenic shock.A, Chest radiograph with zoom of the mitral valve prosthesis, demonstrating opening of 1 leaflet from en face view and other leaflet not seen.

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of mitral valve replacement, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. He presented to the clinic with worsening exertional dyspnea. A transthoracic echocardiogram suggested the presence of a significantly elevated gradient across his mitral prosthesis. A transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated complete immobilization of 1 mechanical leaflet and impaired excursion of the other leaflet, with subsequent severe mitral stenosis. He developed worsening hemodynamic instability and refractory pulmonary edema, and a TandemHeart left ventricular assist device was placed for cardiogenic shock.

The most likely diagnosis is prosthetic valve thrombosis. Prosthetic valve thrombosis is a serious complication of mitral valve replacement that can lead to hemodynamic instability and death. The treatment of prosthetic valve thrombosis is anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by surgical valve replacement if anticoagulation is unsuccessful.

In this case, the patient has already been started on intravenous unfractionated heparin. However, he has continued to deteriorate and is now in cardiogenic shock. In this situation, the best course of action is to obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement.

Title: An Expansile Mass Following Central Lymph Node Dissection Case is: A woman in her 60s returned for a 6-month follow-up after undergoing a substernal total thyroidectomy for a T3N0M0 right-sided undifferentiated insular carcinoma that caused dysphagia, dysphonia, and tracheal deviation (Figure, A and B). The procedure was uneventful and well tolerated. Her history of end-stage renal disease precluded postoperative radioactive iodine treatment. Ultrasonography performed at her 3-month follow-up showed no evidence of disease recurrence or local metastasis. Her compressive symptoms had also resolved. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 × 1.0-cm hypoechoic mass in the right central compartment and a suspicious lymph node in the right carotid sheath. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed recurrence of a malignant neoplasm in the central compartment; however, the lymph node was not amenable to sampling based on its anatomic location. The patient decided to undergo a right central (level VI) lymph node dissection. Intraoperatively, insular carcinoma was dissected away from the cricothyroid membrane and recurrent laryngeal nerve. In the right central compartment several prelaryngeal and pretracheal nodes were identified and excised. After removal of the most distal of these nodes, a separate pale tan mass 2 cm in diameter was visualized at the level of the thoracic inlet. The mass demonstrated respiratory expansion and retraction. The expansile mass was excised. Histopathologic analysis revealed a cystic mass composed primarily of mucosal cells and sparse fibroconnective tissue (Figure, C and D).A, A large heterogeneously enhancing mass with central necrosis arising from the right thyroid fossa with leftward displacement of the trachea (t).

Reasoning:
The patient is a woman in her 60s who returned for a 6-month follow-up after undergoing a substernal total thyroidectomy for a T3N0M0 right-sided undifferentiated insular carcinoma that caused dysphagia, dysphonia, and tracheal deviation. The procedure was uneventful and well tolerated. Her history of end-stage renal disease precluded postoperative radioactive iodine treatment. Ultrasonography performed at her 3-month follow-up showed no evidence of disease recurrence or local metastasis. Her compressive symptoms had also resolved. However, 3 months later, ultrasonography revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 × 1.0-cm hypoechoic mass in the right central compartment and a suspicious lymph node in the right carotid sheath. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed recurrence of a malignant neoplasm in the central compartment; however, the lymph node was not amenable to sampling based on its anatomic location. The patient decided to undergo a right central (level VI) lymph node dissection. Intraoperatively, insular carcinoma was dissected away from the cricothyroid membrane and recurrent laryngeal nerve. In the right central compartment several prelaryngeal and pretracheal nodes were identified and excised. After removal of the most distal of these nodes, a separate pale tan mass 2 cm in diameter was visualized at the level of the thoracic inlet. The mass demonstrated respiratory expansion and retraction. The expansile mass was excised. Histopathologic analysis revealed a cystic mass composed primarily of mucosal cells and sparse fibroconnective tissue.

The differential diagnosis for an expansile mass in the neck includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign causes include lymphadenopathy, branchial cleft cysts, thyroglossal duct cysts, and dermoid cysts. The most common malignant causes include metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.

In this case, the patient's history and presentation are most consistent with a diagnosis of tracheocele. Tracheoceles are rare, acquired, cystic lesions that arise from the wall of the trachea. They are typically located in the posterolateral aspect of the trachea, just above the carina. Tracheoceles can be congenital or acquired. Congenital tracheoceles are thought to be caused by a failure of the tracheal rings to fuse during embryogenesis. Acquired tracheoceles are most commonly caused by trauma to the neck, chronic coughing, or straining.

Tracheoceles are typically asymptomatic. However, large tracheoceles can cause compression of the trachea and surrounding structures, leading to dyspnea, stridor, and hoarseness. Tracheoceles can also become infected, leading to sepsis.

The diagnosis of tracheocele is typically made on imaging studies, such as chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan. Tracheoceles appear as well-defined, air-filled cysts in the neck. On CT scan, tracheoceles can be seen to communicate with the lumen of the trachea.

The treatment of tracheoceles depends on the size and symptoms of the lesion. Small, asymptomatic tracheoceles can be managed conservatively with observation. Larger tracheoceles or those that cause symptoms may require surgical excision.

In this case, the patient's tracheocele was excised during the right central (level VI) lymph node dissection. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day and was able to return to her normal activities.

Title: Laryngeal Mass in an Infant Case is: An infant girl presented to the outpatient clinic with a history of recent-onset hoarseness in her cry. Her parents also reported loud snoring and some retractions during sleep. There was no clinically significant medical or family history. Her birth had been uncomplicated after a term pregnancy. Physical examination revealed mild inspiratory stridor and several light-brown macules approximately 1 cm in size on the patient’s skin. On flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (Figure), a supraglottic mass could be seen, but visualization of the full extent of the larynx or the mass was difficult owing to lack of cooperation by this very young patient. The decision was made to obtain a better view under direct laryngoscopy in the operating room. A submucosal lesion of the left aryepiglottic fold extending inferiorly to the level of the arytenoid, and displacing the epiglottis medially, was found. An incision was made through the mucosa, where a firm, whitish mass that bled minimally was noted, and a biopsy specimen was sent for permanent pathologic analysis. A magnetic resonance image was then obtained to assess the full extent of the mass and whether surrounding tissues were involved.A, View of lesion at the level of the epiglottis on direct laryngoscopy.

Title: Floor of Mouth Swelling Case is: A woman in her 50s presented with a 5-month history of right submandibular swelling and pain, associated with eating and relieved by gland massage. No saliva was expressed on examination. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography showed normal-appearing submandibular glands and neck soft tissues. A sialogram showed high-grade stricture approximately 3 to 4 cm into the right submandibular duct orifice. Complete stricture prevented evaluation of the proximal duct and intraglandular portions. Sialendoscopy showed a widely patent right submandibular duct proximally with a segmental takeoff, consistent with the Bartholin duct draining into the Wharton duct distal to a blind pouch identified 2.5 cm from the intraoral duct orifice (Figure, A). Despite a Wharton ductoplasty to improve sublingual gland drainage through the Bartholin duct, the degree of scarring at the hilum and inability to further dilate warranted submandibular gland (SMG) excision. Four months after SMG excision, she developed a right floor of mouth lesion after “burning her mouth” with high-temperature food. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic lesion in the right sublingual space following the Wharton duct (Figure, B).

Pathologic analysis identified fragments of squamous mucosa with inflammation, cystic space, and compressed granulation tissues consistent with mucous extravasation.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a mucus retention cyst. Mucus retention cysts are the most common type of salivary gland cyst, accounting for 50-75% of all cases. They are typically caused by obstruction of a salivary gland duct, which can occur as a result of inflammation, infection, or trauma. The obstruction leads to accumulation of saliva within the gland, which can eventually form a cyst.

Mucus retention cysts are typically asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on physical examination. However, they can sometimes cause pain, swelling, or tenderness. The cysts are typically round or oval and are filled with a thick, viscous fluid. They can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.

The diagnosis of a mucus retention cyst is typically made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

Treatment for a mucus retention cyst is typically surgical excision. The cyst can be removed through a small incision in the mouth. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia and can be done on an outpatient basis.

The prognosis for patients with a mucus retention cyst is excellent. The surgery is usually successful in removing the cyst and preventing recurrence. The patient should be able to return to their normal activities shortly after the surgery.

Title: Endoscopy Dyspnea and Ulcerative Colitis Case is: A woman in her 20s presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of progressive sore throat, dysphagia, and fever (38.2°C) that developed into dyspnea, dysphonia, and neck pain on the day of presentation. Initially, she had been treated with oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid with no improvement. Her medical history included ulcerative colitis (UC) controlled by oral azathioprine for 2 years. She was a nonsmoker. Initial clinical evaluation revealed respiratory distress with respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Her heart rate was 95 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 135/91 mm Hg, and she was pyretic. Further examination with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (Figure, A) showed considerable erythema and edema of the epiglottitis with patchy necrosis partially obstructing the glottis and saliva pooling in the supraglottis. Findings from the remainder of the otolaryngology examination and chest auscultation were normal. Subsequently, oxygen saturation improved to 100% with 3 L per minute of oxygen via nasal prongs. Her initial laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell count of 12 000/μL, absolute neutrophil count of 46%, hemoglobin count of 12.8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 175 000/μL. Her C-reactive protein level was 5 mg/dL (normal level, <0.5 mg/dL). Results from liver function tests and chest radiograph were normal.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Her C-reactive protein level was 5 mg/dL (normal level, <0.5 mg/dL). Results from liver function tests and chest radiograph were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is necrotic epiglottitis. Necrotic epiglottitis is a rare but life-threatening infection of the epiglottis, the flap of cartilage that covers the opening to the airway. It is most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B, but can also be caused by other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The infection typically starts with a sore throat and fever, and can progress rapidly to respiratory distress and airway obstruction.

The diagnosis of necrotic epiglottitis is made clinically, based on the patient's history and physical examination. The gold standard for diagnosis is flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, which allows the physician to visualize the epiglottis and assess the extent of the infection. Laboratory tests, such as a white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, can be helpful in supporting the diagnosis, but are not definitive.

The treatment of necrotic epiglottitis is prompt antibiotics and airway management. The patient should be admitted to the hospital and placed in an intensive care unit. Intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin and gentamicin, are started immediately. In some cases, intubation or tracheostomy may be necessary to secure the airway.

The prognosis for necrotic epiglottitis is good with prompt treatment. However, the disease can be fatal if it is not recognized and treated early.

Title: Decreased Vision and Cognitive Decline Case is: A man in his 40s was referred for a 1-year history of decreased vision and the sensation of tunnel vision, which accompanied cognitive decline for the past 2 years. He had a history of renal cell carcinoma and had undergone left nephrectomy 1 year prior with no recurrence. Prior to presentation, his evaluation included brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic evaluation with unremarkable results, and he was scheduled to undergo neuropsychological testing.Visual acuity was counting fingers OD, and 20/100 OS. Motility and intraocular pressures were normal. There was a right afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the right eye revealed rubeosis iridis, a clear lens, neovascularization of the optic disc, retinal vasculitis, venous sheathing, and a dusky-appearing peripheral retina. The left eye had a clear lens and a normal fundus on clinical examination. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a mixed retinal arteritis and phlebitis with extensive retinal and choroidal nonperfusion of the right eye with both retinal and optic nerve neovascularization. The left eye demonstrated patches of active arteritis peripherally with a minimally affected posterior pole (Figure).Fluorescein angiogram at 1 minute demonstrating a mixed occlusive arteritis and phlebitis (yellow arrowhead) with extensive areas of retinal and choroidal nonperfusion (white arrowhead) in the right eye.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient's history of decreased vision and tunnel vision, along with the presence of retinal vasculitis, venous sheathing, and a dusky-appearing peripheral retina in the right eye, are highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a systemic vasculitis that typically affects patients over the age of 50, and it is the most common cause of vasculitis-related blindness in the United States. The most common presenting symptoms of GCA are headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness. Visual symptoms, such as decreased vision, are seen in up to 50% of patients with GCA, and they can be the initial presenting symptom in up to 20% of patients.

The diagnosis of GCA is made clinically, based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Laboratory tests, such as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), can be helpful in supporting the diagnosis, but they are not diagnostic. The gold standard for the diagnosis of GCA is a temporal artery biopsy, which is positive in up to 90% of patients with GCA.

The treatment of GCA is with high-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone. The initial dose of methylprednisolone is typically 1 g intravenously daily for 3 days, followed by a taper over the next 2-4 weeks. Patients with GCA should also be started on a daily maintenance dose of prednisone, typically 10-20 mg.

The goal of treatment in GCA is to prevent permanent visual loss. Treatment with corticosteroids should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made, and it should be continued for at least 1 year. In some patients, longer-term treatment may be necessary.

The patient in the case presentation meets the clinical criteria for GCA. He has a history of decreased vision and tunnel vision, along with the presence of retinal vasculitis, venous sheathing, and a dusky-appearing peripheral retina in the right eye. His ESR is elevated, and he has a positive temporal artery biopsy. The patient should be started on high-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, and he should be monitored closely for signs of improvement.

Title: Headaches and Foggy Vision in a 21-Year-Old Woman Case is: A 21-year-old woman presented with foggy vision of her right eye that began 5 months prior. She had daily frontal headaches without any associated visual aura, numbness, or weakness. She had a history of “multiple lasers” of her right eye and blindness of her left eye from an unrepaired retinal detachment. Her medical history included a pheochromocytoma, bilateral adrenal gland resection, and a pancreatic cyst. Her father had a history of retinal detachment in his right eye; her 2 siblings did not have any medical or ocular issues.Visual acuity was 20/200 OD and no light perception OS. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable in the right eye and revealed phthisis bulbi of the left eye. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye revealed prominent, engorged, and tortuous vessels with traction extending from the optic disc to the superior peripheral retina. There was an associated thick fibrotic epiretinal membrane extending from the macula to the superior peripheral retina. The retinal arterioles were attenuated and there was thickening of the macula with subretinal fluid found on optical coherence tomography. In the superior retinal periphery, there was an orange, round, circumscribed mass with overlying tractional retinal detachment and numerous other smaller orange masses (Figure 1A). Fluorescein angiography of her right eye showed early hyperfluorescence of the lesions with late leakage (Figure 1B).A, Wide-field scanning laser image of right fundus showing a round mass with an overlying tractional retinal detachment.

Title: Respiratory Failure in a Woman 8 Months After an Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Case is: A 67-year-old woman with a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) presented with 3 days of fever, weakness, and dyspnea.She was diagnosed with stage IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma 3 years prior and was initially treated with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin. Her disease recurred 1 year later, and she underwent haplotype-matched allogeneic SCT 8 months prior to admission. Two months prior to admission, she developed graft-vs-host disease requiring high-dose prednisone, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. At the time of admission, she was receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone. The patient lived with her family, including her son who recently had a cough. She was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States 3 decades prior. She denied recent travel.On examination, her temperature was 38.3° C, pulse of 115 beats/min, blood pressure of 110/50 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed tachycardia, increased work of breathing and bibasilar crackles without wheezes. Her laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 4.2 × 106/mL (normal range, 3.4-10 × 106/mL), hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL (normal range, 12-15.5 g/dL [to convert g/dL to g/L, multiply by 10]), platelets of 45 × 106/mL (normal range, 140-450 × 106/mL), and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (normal range, 0.5-1.0 mg/dL [to convert mg/dL to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). A chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Initial empirical treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. On hospital day 2, she was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed (Figure, A) and compared with a study 2 weeks prior when she was asymptomatic (Figure, B).A, Computed tomographic (CT) chest image obtained on admission demonstrates diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
**Reasoning:**

The patient has a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant 8 months prior to admission. She is currently receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone. She presented with 3 days of fever, weakness, and dyspnea. On examination, she had tachycardia, increased work of breathing and bibasilar crackles without wheezes. Her laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 4.2 × 106/mL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelets of 45 × 106/mL, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. A chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Initial empirical treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. On hospital day 2, she was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed and demonstrated diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening.

The patient's history and presentation are concerning for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). PCP is a common opportunistic infection in patients with hematologic malignancies and those who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant. It is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii, which is found in the environment and can be inhaled into the lungs. PCP typically presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. On chest imaging, PCP can appear as diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities.

The patient's initial empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir is appropriate. However, given the patient's history and presentation, it is also important to add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) to cover PCP. TMP-SMX is the first-line treatment for PCP. It is a combination of two antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim inhibits the synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that is essential for the growth of bacteria and fungi. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits the synthesis of dihydropteroate synthetase, another enzyme that is essential for the growth of bacteria and fungi. TMP-SMX is effective against a wide range of organisms, including Pneumocystis jirovecii.

The patient should also be given corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation associated with PCP. Corticosteroids can be given as oral prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are not curative for PCP, but they can help to improve the patient's clinical status and reduce the risk of death.

The patient's prognosis depends on the severity of her illness. Patients with mild PCP can be treated with oral TMP-SMX and discharged home. Patients with more severe PCP may require hospitalization and treatment with intravenous TMP-SMX and corticosteroids. The mortality rate for PCP is approximately 10%.

The correct answer is B. Add trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.

Title: Skin Lesions and Recurrent Fever in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patient Treated With Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Case is: A 69-year-old man with a history of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) monocytic type presented with intermittent fever and fatigue 2 months after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Post-SCT bone marrow biopsy specimen analysis at day 30 showed no evidence of leukemic cells and 99.5% donor cells. His home medications included acyclovir, fluconazole, and cyclosporine. Temperature on admission was 103.1° F, and other vital signs were unremarkable. Vancomycin and cefepime were started for possible infection. Complete blood cell counts with differential counts showed no evidence of peripheral blasts. Laboratory and imaging work-up—including chest radiographs, blood culture, fungal culture, urinalysis, sputum culture, respiratory viral panel, fungitell and galactomannan assay, coccidioidomycosis serology, and cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus 6 polymerase chain reaction assays—were all negative. The patient was discharged with oral antibiotics after being afebrile for 72 hours. Thereafter, he had 2 more emergency department visits and was readmitted for recurrent fever. A thorough physical examination revealed 2 nonpruritic skin bumps on the right forearm and left calf that both measured 1.0 cm × 1.5 cm. Both bumps were soft without pigmentation or ulceration. Pathologic sampling of the respective lesions revealed a diffuse infiltration of large mononuclear cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (Figure, A and B).

Immunohistochemistry staining was positive for CD4 cells and myeloperoxidase (Figure, C and D).

The most likely diagnosis is leukemia cutis. Leukemia cutis is a cutaneous manifestation of leukemia that occurs when leukemic cells infiltrate the skin. It is most commonly seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it can also occur in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The skin lesions of leukemia cutis can be varied in appearance, but they are often described as red, raised, and scaly. They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk and extremities. The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made by biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of leukemic cells in the skin.

The treatment of leukemia cutis depends on the type of leukemia and the severity of the skin lesions. In some cases, the skin lesions may resolve on their own with treatment of the underlying leukemia. In other cases, the skin lesions may require treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a 34-year-old woman who has been experiencing thickened toenails for more than 20 years. She has used an over-the-counter antifungal cream intermittently to treat pruritus of her feet. Her father and sister have similar, but less severe, toenail problems. She has no history of dandruff, skin problems, or joint pains. Her medical history is significant for asthma, but she has been symptom free for more than 7 years without medications. She reports no pain in the nails or difficulty ambulating. The patient, a stay-at-home mother, denied prior toenail trauma, frequent sports activities, or hyperhidrosis of the feet. She had undergone no previous diagnostic tests or treatment for her toenails. Physical examination revealed thickening, yellow discoloration, and subungual hyperkeratosis of all 10 toenails. Scale was present on the plantar surface skin and in the web spaces. Examination of the fingernails, scalp, and skin was normal.

The most likely diagnosis is onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nails. Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder, affecting up to 50% of adults over the age of 60. The most common cause of onychomycosis is Trichophyton rubrum, followed by T. mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum. Onychomycosis is more common in men than women, and in people with diabetes, immunosuppression, or chronic foot problems.

The diagnosis of onychomycosis is based on clinical findings and laboratory tests. The KOH preparation is a simple and inexpensive test that can be used to detect fungal elements in nail scrapings. The nail biopsy is a more definitive test, but it is more invasive and expensive.

The treatment of onychomycosis depends on the severity of the infection. Topical antifungals are effective for mild infections, but they may take several months to be effective. Oral antifungals are more effective than topical antifungals, but they are also more expensive and have more side effects.

In this case, the patient has a long-standing history of thickened toenails. She has tried over-the-counter antifungal cream without success. She has no history of dandruff, skin problems, or joint pains. Her medical history is significant for asthma, but she has been symptom free for more than 7 years without medications. She reports no pain in the nails or difficulty ambulating. The patient, a stay-at-home mother, denied prior toenail trauma, frequent sports activities, or hyperhidrosis of the feet.

A punch biopsy was performed for histopathologic examination.

The histopathologic findings showed a circumscribed proliferation of pigmented epithelioid melanocytic nests, located primarily at tips of rete ridges. Moderate cytologic atypia was present. Superficial papillary dermis showed prominent pigment incontinence. No mitotic figures were seen. Kamino bodies were not visualized. Melan-A immunostain showed low pagetoid migration of melanocytes with a lack of melanocytic confluence at the dermal-epidermal junction.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN). DPN is a benign, acquired melanocytic proliferation that is most common in African Americans. It is characterized by the eruption of small, dark brown or black papules on the face, neck, and upper extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) is a type of melanoma that typically presents as a single, irregularly shaped, pigmented lesion. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most common on the trunk, back, and legs. SSM is the most common type of melanoma in white people.

Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi (EDSN) is a rare, acquired disorder of melanocytic nevi that typically presents in children and young adults. It is characterized by the eruption of hundreds or thousands of small, pink or brown papules on the face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Metastatic melanoma is a type of melanoma that has spread from its original site to other parts of the body. It is the most serious type of melanoma. Metastatic melanoma can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the lungs, liver, brain, and bones.

What Is Your Diagnosis?
A: Ewing sarcoma
B: Tuberculous spondylitis
C: Discitis
D: Pyogenic osteomyelitis

Answer: D. Pyogenic osteomyelitis

Pyogenic osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by bacteria. It is the most common type of osteomyelitis in children. The infection usually starts in the bloodstream and then spreads to the bone. The most common symptoms of pyogenic osteomyelitis are fever, pain, and swelling at the site of the infection. Treatment for pyogenic osteomyelitis typically includes antibiotics and surgery to drain the abscess.

The patient in this case presents with several features that are consistent with a diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis. He is an 11-year-old boy, which is the age group that is most commonly affected by this condition. He has a history of fever, pain, and swelling at the site of the infection. His imaging studies show evidence of bone destruction and abscess formation. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are Ewing sarcoma, tuberculous spondylitis, and discitis. Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can affect the bones. It is most commonly seen in children and adolescents. The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma include pain, swelling, and a mass at the site of the tumor. Treatment for Ewing sarcoma typically includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Tuberculous spondylitis is a type of tuberculosis that affects the spine. It is most commonly seen in people who live in areas with high rates of tuberculosis. The symptoms of tuberculous spondylitis include pain, stiffness, and fever. Treatment for tuberculous spondylitis typically includes antibiotics and surgery.

Discitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc. It is most commonly seen in children and adolescents. The symptoms of discitis include pain, stiffness, and fever. Treatment for discitis typically includes antibiotics and rest.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are all most consistent with a diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis. Therefore, the best answer is D.

Title: Fatty Tumor Compressing the Heart Case is: A man in his 40s training for weight-lifting presented with new-onset progressive dizziness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. His medical and family history as well as review of other systems were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a positive Kussmaul sign and pulsus paradoxus but no cardiac murmurs. There was no pedal edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Results of a complete blood cell count and biochemical panel were within reference ranges. A chest radiograph revealed convexity on the right heart border suggestive of cardiomegaly (Figure 1A). Echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac chambers and valves. However, an echogenicity was noted compressing the superior vena cava and right ventricle. The patient subsequently underwent computed tomographic imaging of the chest that revealed a large, 16.2 × 6.8 × 5.6-cm anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right cardiac structures, particularly the superior vena cava.

Tumor marker levels, including α-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin, were within reference ranges.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a thymolipoma. Thymolipomas are benign tumors that are composed of both fat and thymic tissue. They are most commonly found in the anterior mediastinum, and they can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures. In this case, the patient's symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath are likely due to compression of the superior vena cava by the thymolipoma.

The differential diagnosis for a thymolipoma includes other anterior mediastinal masses, such as thymoma, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. However, the patient's imaging findings are most consistent with a thymolipoma. The absence of elevated tumor markers further supports the diagnosis of a thymolipoma, as these markers are often elevated in thymoma and other malignant tumors.

Title: Abdominal Pain Following Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding Case is: A 67-year-old man was evaluated for lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding. He had been transferred from an outside institution with rectal bleeding requiring blood transfusion. The result of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed at the referring institution was normal. A colonoscopy had been performed at the referring institution, but visualization was poor, with fresh blood and clots noted in the ascending colon. Endoscopic treatment of a right colon arteriovenous malformation with active bleeding was attempted. This was unsuccessful and bleeding persisted. The patient underwent urgent angiography and embolization of a right colic artery branch (Figure 1B). At angiography, no blush or bleeding vessel was evident. The decision to embolize the right colic branch was based on the endoscopic findings and the presence of pooling contrast in the cecum noted on a computed tomographic angiogram (Figure 1A) performed at the referring institution. He had no further bleeding episodes. Twenty hours after the procedure, he reported abdominal pain. Findings from computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained at this time were unremarkable. He was treated with antibiotics and observed.

Title: Reduced Visual Acuity Following Kidney Stone Extraction Case is: A man in his 60s presented with subacute vision loss in his right eye for the prior 3 weeks. His medical history was significant for diabetes without retinopathy and radial keratotomy in both eyes for moderate myopia. The patient had undergone 2 ureterorenoscopies over a 2-week period with laser fragmentation for nephrolithiasis. A ureteral stent was placed followed by systemic ciprofloxacin. The patient’s urinary symptoms subsequently improved. In the ensuing days to weeks after these urologic procedures, the patient reported fever, weakness, and decreased appetite, which resolved spontaneously after several days but resulted in persistent weight loss of approximately 15 lb. Three months following this episode, visual symptoms developed.On examination, visual acuity was 20/400 OD and 20/20 OS. Intraocular pressure, pupils, visual fields, and ocular motility were normal. On slitlamp examination of the right eye, trace conjunctival hyperemia was present, the anterior chamber had occasional cells, the lens had mild nuclear/cortical cataract, and the anterior vitreous had 2+ cells. Dilated fundus examination of the right eye showed grade 2 vitreous haze, mild optic disc edema, scattered elevated white chorioretinal lesions—some with mild surrounding intraretinal and subretinal hemorrhage—and a prominent macular lesion (Figure 1). In the left eye, there were 3 small white chorioretinal lesions inferiorly and no other abnormalities.Dilated fundus examination of the right eye demonstrated vitreous haze, mild optic disc edema, and an elevated white chorioretinal lesion (arrowhead) in the macula, surrounded by mild intraretinal and subretinal hemorrhage.Initiate uveitis workup and begin topical glucocorticoid therapyWhat Would You Do Next?

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning:
The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of posterior uveitis. Posterior uveitis is an inflammation of the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and tumors.
In this case, the patient's history of kidney stones and ureterorenoscopy is concerning for a possible infectious cause of his uveitis. Uveitis can be a sight-threatening complication of kidney stones, and it is important to treat it promptly.
The patient's examination findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of posterior uveitis. The presence of vitreous haze, mild optic disc edema, scattered elevated white chorioretinal lesions, and a prominent macular lesion are all characteristic findings of posterior uveitis.
The next step in the management of this patient is to initiate a uveitis workup. This includes a complete history and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, liver function tests, and urinalysis. Imaging studies such as an ultrasound of the kidneys and an MRI of the brain may also be helpful.
Once the underlying cause of the uveitis has been identified, treatment can be initiated. In the case of an infectious cause, treatment with antibiotics is indicated. In the case of an autoimmune cause, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs is indicated.
In the meantime, the patient can be treated symptomatically with topical steroids and cycloplegics. Topical steroids help to reduce inflammation, while cycloplegics help to reduce eye pain and inflammation.

Title: A Slightly Displaced Pupil in One Eye Case is: A boy aged 17 years presented after noticing that his right pupil was off-center. He had a high hyperopic refractive error, and the magnification of his spectacle lenses highlighted the eccentric pupil. He had no associated symptoms of decreased vision, ocular pain, diplopia, glare, or haloes and had no history of ocular infection, surgical procedure, or trauma. His mother, also hyperopic, previously underwent prophylactic laser iridotomy for anatomically narrow, occludable angles.Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, with a manifest refraction of +7.75 −1.00 × 170 OD and +7.75 −1.25 × 010 OS. Slitlamp examination confirmed mild corectopia in the right eye, along with 4 clock hours of iridocorneal touch nasally and a “hammered silver” appearance to the involved cornea (Figure 1). On examination via gonioscopy, there were high peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) above the Schwalbe line in this area, while the remaining angle was deep without PAS. The left eye was normal. Intraocular pressures were 15 mm Hg OD and 14 mm Hg OS. Pachymetry testing revealed symmetric central corneal thicknesses of 577 μm OD and 582 μm OS. Both optic discs appeared healthy, with a cup-disc ratio of 0.2. There were no visual field defects.Slitlamp photography showed the right eye had mild corectopia and iridocorneal touch nasally.Test the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1What Would You Do Next?

Reasoning: The patient has a slightly displaced pupil in one eye, along with 4 clock hours of iridocorneal touch nasally and a “hammered silver” appearance to the involved cornea. These findings are consistent with angle closure glaucoma, which is a serious condition that can lead to blindness if not treated. The patient's mother has a history of prophylactic laser iridotomy for anatomically narrow, occludable angles, which suggests that the patient may also be at risk for angle closure glaucoma. Therefore, the next step in management should be to test the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1, which is a common cause of angle closure glaucoma.

She also reported intermittent, binocular diplopia. Results from a review of systems were otherwise negative, and she had not experienced recent trauma. She was started on topical antihypertensive drugs for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the affected eye (30 mm Hg) and referred to our institution. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes with subjective red desaturation OD. Pupils were equal and without afferent pupillary defect. Confrontation visual fields were full. Intraocular pressures were 24 mm Hg OD and 12 mm Hg OS. Hertel exophthalmometry showed 4.5 mm of relative proptosis OD. She had limitation of her extraocular muscles in nearly all fields of gaze OD, with the most obvious limitation occurring in abduction. She had decreased sensation to light touch in the right cheek (cranial nerve V2). There were no orbital bruits. Ocular examination revealed diffuse conjunctival injection OD with tortuous, dilated, corkscrew-shaped blood vessels (Figure, A). Dilated fundus examination revealed mild optic nerve hyperemia and mild vascular tortuosity OD. Vital signs and results from complete blood cell count and thyroid function tests were normal. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and venography of the brain and orbits revealed extraocular muscle enlargement and enhancement and a dilated superior ophthalmic vein OD.

Title: Traumatic Cataract and Heterochromia Iridis Case is: An otherwise healthy white man in his 40s was referred to the cornea service for decreased vision in the setting of a white cataract in his left eye. The patient reported the acute onset of foreign body sensation in his left eye while splitting wood 1 year prior. He attended a hospital emergency department at that time and was diagnosed with a corneal abrasion and treated with topical antibiotics. He stated that his vision initially returned to normal after treatment, but had subsequently worsened. He complained of tearing, photophobia, and burning in the left eye.The visual acuity was hand motions OS with a grossly constricted visual field by confrontation. The intraocular pressure was normal. The anterior segment examination revealed mild edema of the cornea, a shallow anterior chamber, iris heterochromia (Figure 1A), and an intumescent white cataract with pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule. The cataract precluded visualization of the fundus. B-scan ultrasonography did not reveal masses, retinal detachment, or foreign body (Figure 1B).Heterochromia iridis.

Please think step by step and then choose an answer option. The output format is: Reasoning:(Explanation )  and    Answer: (fill in the letter of the answer)
Reasoning: The patient has a white cataract in his left eye, which is a clouding of the lens that can cause decreased vision. The cataract is intumescent, meaning that it is swollen and may be putting pressure on the eye. The patient also has iris heterochromia, which is a condition in which the irises of the eyes are different colors. This is a non-pathological condition that does not require treatment.

The patient's visual acuity is hand motions in the left eye, which means that he can only see large objects with his left eye. His intraocular pressure is normal, which means that the pressure inside his eye is within the normal range. The anterior segment examination revealed mild edema of the cornea, a shallow anterior chamber, and an intumescent white cataract with pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule. The cataract precluded visualization of the fundus. B-scan ultrasonography did not reveal masses, retinal detachment, or foreign body.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of traumatic cataract. The patient's vision is significantly decreased and is likely to continue to worsen as the cataract progresses. The cataract is also causing inflammation and pressure within the eye, which could lead to complications such as glaucoma or retinal detachment.

The next step in management is to remove the cataract. This can be done with phacoemulsification, a minimally invasive procedure that uses ultrasound to break up the cataract and then suction it out of the eye. A new lens is then implanted in the eye to replace the old one.

Answer: D. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement in the left eye

Title: Spontaneous Cerebral Hemorrhage and Sudden Biventricular Failure After Lung Transplantation Case is: A woman in her mid-60s with end-stage lung disease secondary to systemic sclerosis and pulmonary hypertension underwent bilateral sequential lung transplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass through a clamshell thoracotomy. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and she was weaned off oxygen support. On postoperative day 10, she developed seizures when walking and was immediately intubated. Brain imaging revealed a new intracerebral hemorrhage in the right frontal and left occipital lobes, with narrowing of the internal carotid, basilar, posterior cerebral, and right posterior communicating arteries, suggestive of vasospasm or vasculopathy. Subsequently, she developed hypoxemia and hypotension associated with acute pulmonary edema and new cardiomegaly (Figure 1A). An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes with T-wave inversion (Figure 1B), and serum levels of troponin and creatine phosphokinase were negative. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed new dilation of the left ventricle (LV), with an ejection fraction of 10%, functional mitral regurgitation, anterior and apical akinesis, and basal hypokinesis (Video 1, Video 2, and Video 3). The right ventricle (RV) was distended, with moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Recent pretransplantation coronary angiography did not reveal atherosclerosis. Her cardiopulmonary status rapidly worsened, with cardiogenic shock and refractory hypoxemia (arterial blood pH, 7.12; arterial partial pressure of oxygen, 43 mm Hg; and partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 56 mm Hg), despite mechanical ventilation (rate, 24/min; tidal volume, 6 mL/kg; fraction of inspired oxygen, 100%; and positive end-expiratory pressure, 15 cm H2O), neuromuscular blockade, and administration of inotropes.Patient workup. A, Chest radiographs were obtained on the morning of postoperative day 10 before (left) and after (right) the onset of pulmonary edema. B, An electrocardiogram shows nonspecific ST changes and T-wave inversion.What Is Your Diagnosis?

Title: New Facial Weakness After 5 Years of Facial Asymmetry Case is: A man in his 30s presented with a steady 5-year progression of facial asymmetry and new-onset left-sided facial weakness, pain, and otalgia. Physical examination revealed no palpable parotid mass and no overlying skin changes. Neurologic examination showed incomplete left eye closure with a grade 5 of 6 on the House-Brackmann scale. Treatment with steroids and antiviral agents marginally improved facial strength and allowed eye closure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed subcutaneous nodules focally infiltrating the superficial parotid gland with evidence of perineural spread along the labyrinthine segment of CN VII. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasonographic guidance was nondiagnostic. An open excisional biopsy demonstrated dense subcutaneous tissue overlying and invading the parotid gland. Intraoperative frozen section revealed a spindle cell tumor. A superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection and preservation was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a subcutaneous mass with stellate extension into and around the parotid gland. The tumor consisted of bland fusiform tumor cells in a storiform pattern near inconspicuous hyalinized vessels (Figure, A and B). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated diffuse positivity for CD34 (Figure, C), positivity for bcl-2, and negativity for CD99 and S-100. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) further characterized the tumor with a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) and corresponding COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein (Figure, D).A-C, Histopathologic images. A, Tumor infiltrating around and within the parotid gland. B, Fusiform tumor cells arranged in a storiform pattern. C, Tumor cells strongly positive for CD34.

**Reasoning:**
The patient is a man in his 30s with a 5-year history of facial asymmetry and new-onset left-sided facial weakness, pain, and otalgia. Physical examination revealed no palpable parotid mass and no overlying skin changes. Neurologic examination showed incomplete left eye closure with a grade 5 of 6 on the House-Brackmann scale.

The differential diagnosis of a spindle cell tumor of the parotid gland includes solitary fibrous tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, malignant melanoma, and spindle cell carcinoma. Solitary fibrous tumors are the most common type of spindle cell tumor of the parotid gland. They are typically well-circumscribed and non-invasive, and they are often associated with overlying skin changes. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare type of spindle cell tumor that is typically located on the extremities. It is characterized by a storiform growth pattern and a tendency to recur locally. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive type of skin cancer that can metastasize to distant sites. Spindle cell carcinoma is a rare type of carcinoma that can occur in any organ, including the parotid gland. It is typically aggressive and has a poor prognosis.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic features of this patient are most consistent with a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. The patient is a young man with a history of facial asymmetry and new-onset left-sided facial weakness, pain, and otalgia. Physical examination revealed no palpable parotid mass and no overlying skin changes. Neurologic examination showed incomplete left eye closure with a grade 5 of 6 on the House-Brackmann scale. Treatment with steroids and antiviral agents marginally improved facial strength and allowed eye closure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed subcutaneous nodules focally infiltrating the superficial parotid gland with evidence of perineural spread along the labyrinthine segment of CN VII. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasonographic guidance was nondiagnostic. An open excisional biopsy demonstrated dense subcutaneous tissue overlying and invading the parotid gland. Intraoperative frozen section revealed a spindle cell tumor. A superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection and preservation was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a subcutaneous mass with stellate extension into and around the parotid gland. The tumor consisted of bland fusiform tumor cells in a storiform pattern near inconspicuous hyalinized vessels.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) further characterized the tumor with a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) and corresponding COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is solitary fibrous tumor of the parotid gland.

Title: A Rare Cause of Bilateral Conductive Hearing Loss in a Young Boy Case is: A young boy presented to the pediatric otolaryngology clinic with bilateral conductive hearing loss (CHL) and delayed speech development. Examination revealed normal otoscopic findings, and an audiogram demonstrated moderate low-frequency CHL of 45 dB in the right ear and mild 30-dB CHL in the left ear with a normal tympanogram (Figure, A). Two sets of tympanostomy tubes were placed the year before his initial visit for presumed otitis media–related CHL, but his hearing did not improve. An axial computed tomographic (CT) scan performed at that time was interpreted as normal. Owing to concerns of visual changes and possible associated genetic cause for hearing loss (HL), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered 1 year after initial presentation and showed no central or peripheral otologic abnormalities. A genetic evaluation revealed no abnormalities. Follow-up audiograms at 3 and 6 months showed similar persistent CHL despite normal otoscopy results. The patient and family decided to treat the CHL with bilateral hearing aid amplification and a frequency modulation (FM) system at school. After 30 months of persistent CHL with an unknown etiology, a repeated CT scan of the temporal bones was performed (Figure, B and C). Operative intervention vs amplification was discussed, and the patient and family decided to continue with hearing aids because he had improved performance in school. Surgical treatment will be considered in the future if there is a decline in hearing.A, Right-sided (45-db) and left-sided (30-db) conductive hearing loss in low frequencies (arrows). O and X indicate right and left air conduction, respectively; opening and closing brackets, right and left bone conduction, respectively.
