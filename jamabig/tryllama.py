The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows. B, Tzanck smear using Wright-Giemsa staining of specimen demonstrating ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material (original magnification Ã—20).What Is Your Diagnosis?
